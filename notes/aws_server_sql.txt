## Assuming the current working directory is ~/Desktop/Insight/courtcast/db/

## dump local machine database to file
mysqldump -u root scotus > scotus_dump.sql

## Copy dump file from local machine to AWS server, using the identity key
scp -i ./Insight2014C.pem scotus_dump.sql ubuntu@courtcast.org:~/

## Log into mysql on the AWS server and create database (once)
mysql -u root -p 
[enter password scipw]
CREATE DATABASE scotus;

## Copy the database from the dump file on the AWS server
mysql -u root -p scotus < scotus_dump.sql


## Edit the run.py file to not run in debug format:
	#!/usr/bin/env python
	from app import app
	def main():
	    app.run('0.0.0.0', port=80, debug = False)
	if __name__ == '__main__':
	    main()

## Copy the run.py file and the app/ folder to the server
scp -i ./Insight2014C.pem run.py ubuntu@courtcast.org:~/
scp -i ./Insight2014C.pem -r app/ ubuntu@courtcast.org:~/


## Set up domains.google.com to forward the domain name to the elastic IP address I set up at AWS. Now works, so courtcast.org is live. But the IP address has changed form the initial one. But instead of using an IP address I can ssh or scp in using ubuntu@courtcast.org:~/

## Check what processes are running on server
ps -e | grep supervisord
ps -e | grep gunicorn

## Kill processes running of we want to restart
sudo pkill supervisord
sudo pkill gunicorn

## Restart the site
sudo supervisord -c simple.conf

Ran into problems with packages. The seaborn package for making nice plots insisted on calling a file called six.py that needed a _winreg that is supposed to be for writing to the windows registry. This is weird since the server is Linux. I removed seaborn references and it was better.

But in making sure that I had all the right packages installed (matplotlib was a bitch to install) I used several commands.


apt-cache search <modulename> was for searching the repository to see if a module can be installed with apt-get
apt-cache policy <module> was for seeing what has been installed already
apt-get is a way to load precompiled binary files for Linux.
sudo apt-get install <modulename>

pip search <modulename> does something similar for python, seeing if it can be installed with pip
pip freeze shows everything installed for python on the machine.
sudo pip install <modulename>
or with --upgrade to upgrade an existing package rather than install a new one.
