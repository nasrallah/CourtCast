04-1034 +++$+++         Well, it -- it seems to me that what works in your favor is -- is it SWANCC?                I don't -- I'm not quite sure how to pronounce the case.        The Migratory Bird Rule case where we said there had to be a significant nexus. But I think what the Court is asking you is -- is how to define significant nexus.              We're -- if you want us just to say, well, this case is too much, but then the Corps of Engineers should use its expertise to come up with a new regulation, that's rather an odd opinion for us to write.        And it seems to me that that's what you're asking us to do here.        Was it -- was it also clear that after the improvement, there would be no drainage?        I'm --        -- I'm still not clear as to what the findings were, if there were findings, as to what the condition would be after the improvement. Would there be an increased likelihood of drainage into the ditch after the improvement?        And -- and if that were so, would that be sufficient for jurisdiction?        But, well -- suppose the interaction were automatic.             Would that suffice to make this a wetlands after the improvement?
04-10566 +++$+++            Was there a showing of prejudice in that case or just automatic exclusion?            Well, of course, that's assuming a causal link, which is an altogether different problem. But it's still not clear to me.                 Are you saying that we should require the States to follow and the United States Government to follow an exclusionary rule because that's what the treaty requires or because this is the remedy that we ought to devise in the exercise of our supervisory powers?                        And if it's the latter, it seems to me surely there must be some causal linkage between the violation and the -- and the statement at -- at a minimum.        One of the things -- and I -- I really have this question for all counsel.                 If the Miranda warning is given, it seems to me that that comprehends the relief that you need.                  If the accused talks with his attorney, his attorney is presumed to know the treaty's -- the provisions of the convention. If he does not, he proceeds at his risk.                 Attorneys have lots of things they can tell clients, and if you don't have an attorney, you proceed at your risk.                  I just think this is a very important point here.         Well, but you -- you want us to write an opinion to say that we're holding our attorneys to the same standard of evaluation as the attorneys in Syria --         -- and -- and our bar is -- is not to be trusted to have the expertise that's at least equivalent to that of the foreign counsel?         But the question is who tells you about that choice, and your attorney can tell you about that choice.          Has the Honduran Government offered to arrest and extradite that witness from Honduras to bring him back to the United States?        Well, it's the same point we've been covering, but all seem to concede that the particular characteristics of a national system have to be taken into account.           And the distinguishing feature of our system is that it's an adversary system.                   And you're asking us to make an exception to that system --            -- an exception to the usual rules that prevail in that system, and that's not consistent with what the treaty requires.            Well, but that's because in Brady, as Justice Souter has already pointed out, there's a factual piece of evidence that the State has withheld.         Here, the lawyer is presumed to know the law.      It's just not an apt analogy.
04-1067 +++$+++           What --          What about the extent of the search?           Can the wife say, "It's okay for you to come in, and you can look in my husband's top drawer"?          I mean, how does the --          -- how does the policeman --          -- so, how is the policeman supposed to know that?        Well, but that's the           --        Well, I guess that --        -- that depends on what we say.      I'm, frankly, still somewhat surprised at your answer to Justice O'Connor, indicating that it happens all the time where there are two occupants, and one expressly says, "You can't come in," and they do anyway.        But leaving that aside, it seems to me that most of the considerations that would impel a decision in your favor can be answered under other doctrines. If there's cocaine that's being used and may be destroyed, there's exigent circumstances.              I don't see the necessity for the rule that you propose.        But she can do that by advising the police, and then there's probable cause. Or, if the husband's there, there are probably exigent circumstances.        But -- well, you keep saying that, but that policy is -- can be vindicated by using doctrines other than consent.                 And you want us to -- I think you want us to say, I think we have to say, that there's a general social expectation that the person who wants entry overrides the person who doesn't.        And I also agree with Justice Scalia, that social expectation may be, in part, measured by our cases on this subject.                 And I just don't see how, if it's against the interest of an occupant to allow entry, that that -- that that interest must, necessarily, be overridden.        You want us to take the position that there's no legal difference between, (a) entering a home and taking something, and, (b) receiving it on the outside?
04-1084 +++$+++        It seems to me your position is that you must -- we must give controlling determinative weight to the fact that it's listed in Schedule 1.                 And the respondents say you don't give it any weight at all, it's all on a case-by-case basis.                Is there a middle ground that there -- which I think would allow you to prevail here -- that there is a presumption that there is a compelling governmental interest when it's in Schedule 1?     It's a rebuttable presumption, but it's a presumption that, when it's in Schedule 1, it's a compelling interest.       The --        Well, but part of the statute is Sherbert and Verner and the test that Congress says we have to apply to its acts here.         I want you --         -- to stay on this point, because it's important, but if this were a Schedule 2 substance, would your argument be the same?       Do --       -- do your briefs --       -- indicate, or does the record indicate, that the Government was foreclosed from presenting any evidence it wanted to present?                If you, for some reason, go back, and this whole thing is done again, whether they -- is there important additional evidence for you to introduce, or do we essentially have the case in front of us, so far as you're concerned?       -- I understand the broader point, but --
04-1131 +++$+++            Was it raised?    Was that objection, the jurisdictional question, raised in the briefs and --        But the grievance procedure covers it, and you took pains to point out to us that when you go to the grievance procedure, you re not necessarily entitled to findings and -- and written conclusions, et cetera.                But there s a reason for that. The reason for that is that these things can be very, very minor.              So now you re saying that just because of -- the grievance procedure doesn t entitle you necessarily to findings, et cetera, that you can go into court.              But the only reason you don t get those findings is because we know, going in, that they re so minor.       So now the most minor things go to court.                 That seems very anomalous.
04-1140 +++$+++            Well, you stated, at the outset -- and, I think, properly so -- that we're interested in what incentives --           -- are put in place by whatever rule we adopt.              I'm not sure about the incentives in -- on the facts of this case, or in other cases, based on your rule.                   The defendant has only 30 days to decide whether to remove.                    That's a Federal right that should be given some due consideration.            You, in effect, want to make the removing defendant an insurer against improper removal.         And I just don't know why that should be the policy.        But --             -- shouldn't we know what the rule is with reference to the extensive fees Justice Stevens requires?                    Shouldn't we know that, as part of the background for what we're going to do in this case?              And if you say -- and you seem to indicate, "Well, it's going to be up to the discretion of the judge."                 Well, if we know what the rule is, then it's not part of the discretion.
04-1144 +++$+++           Your first answer to Justice Souter was that the physician would say you can't be prosecuted under our law.                  Do you mean this act that we're looking at here?                Or do you mean the law generally including constitutional protections that this Court has proclaimed?             Because of the text of the act or because of some policy that the attorney general would follow in order just to decline to prosecute?          We want to know what this act says in the instance posed by Justice Souter.             Suppose I were to conclude that under Casey, this fraction test applies to this case.             Suppose I were to say that Salerno should not be applicable in this case.                     How should I rule in this case?             Could the plaintiffs have filed a narrower action attacking the adequacy of the bypass procedure?
04-1152 +++$+++          Well, that's fine, but you were the one that made the argument that they want the same access as other employers.                That's --            -- when you -- I just --         -- want to make sure what the calculus is, at the outset.        But the --        -- the resistance to any statute, I assume, could be justified as symbolic speech.        You mean, they could organize a student protest at the hiring interview rooms, so that everybody jeers when the applicant comes in the door and the school could organize that?        As -- when it's --        -- when it's, say, a job fair, and all the employers are there, but then they jeer just the -- and the school organizes a line jeering the -- both the recruiters and the applicants, that's equal access?        I'm surprised that --        -- you think that --        Well, --        You think if you --        -- have jeering --        -- jeering and picketing if a black person came to recruit and people didn't -- and a school faculty didn't like blacks?        I think that that's an extraordinary position you're taking.        We're talking --        -- about the practical meaning of "equal access."
04-1170 +++$+++         Well, let me ask -- ask you this.       As a -- rather than presumptions, can we look at this case as a matter of shifting burdens of proof?                 I -- I take it the Constitution does not require the State to introduce mitigating evidence.                That's -- that's the responsibility of the accused.        And so what we're saying here is that when a State shows that the mitigators do not outweigh the aggravators, then it's the defendant's/accused's burden to go forward and show that they do.             Well, but -- but I take it the State has no duty to adduce mitigating factors.
04-1186 +++$+++              Well, what would -- what would be your view?              I know the question is not before us, but suppose we had a question like the principal place of business.
04-1203 +++$+++          Of course, all of the concerns you've mentioned could be taken care of by injunctive relief.         You don't necessarily need damages.         Well, but if we held the Act was applicable for injunctive relief, it would -- it would be, because I'm -- the pert part of your argument is that you could have a attorneys fees and triple damages where trial attorneys levy against the State treasury, which is -- which is what the eleventh amendment is largely concerned with.                    That -- all of that would follow from what you've said so far.        I know they're not available under Title II, but, I mean, as a constitutional matter, there's certainly nothing barring them, based on what you've told us so far.          Why is it so clear that damages are necessary and that equitable relief shouldn't suffice?          It's --          -- it's puzzling -- it's puzzling to me, the notion that trial attorneys and their clients can levy upon the funds in State treasuries under the Eleventh Amendment.                 Why is it congruent and proportional to allow that?         Well, where you say Section 1983 failed, the ADA could allow equitable remedies.         And why --         And why shouldn't that -- why shouldn't that suffice?
04-1244 +++$+++          Well, I'm with you --         -- up to the point where you say it went as far as it possibly could.                As Justice Scalia indicates, why didn't it say, "This is the way the Act must be interpreted," period?                So, it didn't go as far as -- I'm just quibbling with your -- I'm just quibbling with your statement that it went as far as it possibly could.       I don't think it did.         That's the problem.         We got you off of --           We got you off of your first point, but I'd like to just loop back to that for a minute, at this point.              Is this imprecision, this ambiguity, grounds for our reading -- our insisting on reading our earlier remand and judgment literally and saying that there are no predicate acts -- there are no predicate acts that support this judgment?           Do -- is there some prudential argument for us not to reach this issue and just insist on the wording of our earlier mandate?       What do you mean?   It's a separate --       -- a separate offense?       So you charge two counts for violating the same section?       Two separate violations, each of which violates the same statute?        I have -- just have one question.         If we were to adopt the Petitioner's first suggestion that we should simply have a strict reading of our mandate, would that cause problems, so far as people interpreting our precedent and indicating that, by implication, we've reached this Hobbs Act question?
04-1264 +++$+++         Does -- does that include a quarrel over offer and acceptance?        I m -- we re trying to explore the -- the meaning of -- of this -- of this assent.        I know there are going to be hard cases, but I want to try to see how we describe this area where it is for the court.           What about offer and acceptance?           You misinterpreted my letter.        It was not an acceptance.          It s -- it s a little odd that --          -- the way our -- it s a little odd that the way our cases have -- have worked out is that we assume there s two contracts, one for arbitration and the other for the rest of the contracts.          That s -- that s the way we ve rationalized these cases.              It seems a little odd to me.          Well, Prima Paint certainly displaced the States and State law from this area in a very substantial -- to a very substantial extent. I m curious now.      Have there been any attempts in Congress to overrule Prima Paint?
04-1324 +++$+++            So, the -- it's right that there's an obligation if it notices it in the first instance on its first review.           And suppose, under the review proceedings, that District Court is looking at it for the first time, without yet having required a response, and he sees a statute of limitation.                I assume there's an obligation.           Sure.           I mean, if -- suppose it's an open-and-shut violation of the statute of limitations, or barred by the statute of limitations - -          -- does District Court have discretion to refer to the State for a response?          Really?          No, my --          No, my --          -- my hypothetical is that it is.
04-1327 +++$+++           Well, I -- I suppose that in a purely discretionary system -- I -- I can't quite think of the hypothetical -- the strength of the prosecution's case may bear on the assessment of relevance and materiality as to the evidence the defense wants to introduce.              If -- if the evidence of identification is -- is quite clear -- is quite clear -- and then there's some witness of marginal credibility that says he was in another city, I think that may affect the trial court's balance. I -- I take the thrust of your point, that the strength of the case makes it more important to introduce the third party evidence, not -- not less.                  I -- I take that point.           But just as -- as an absolute rule, I'm not sure that the strength of the case is always irrelevant.         That's what I'm saying.            Well, I'm -- I'm just not sure that's the case.               We're asking about 403.           In order to completely exclude and prescind, in Justice Scalia's word, that the -- the nature of the prosecution's case just doesn't seem to me right.            Now -- now, if you want to say there's a more wooden rule and a -- and a more iron rule here that was prejudicial, I think that's something else.        Well, I -- I guess my -- my point -- maybe it's some of my colleagues' point -- is that really the strength of the government's case is subsumed within the general calculus of whether or not this would cause a delay of -- of time, whether it would get into extraneous issues, et cetera.           It's a way of phrasing it.
04-1329 +++$+++         Well, I suppose -- I suppose we could say -- I just hadn't thought of it.                  I -- I suppose we -- we could say that it's not a separate product.        I mean, no -- no -- there's no market for the -- for the small micro-component in the TV.      You're selling a TV.        It's an -- a very interesting question, but it seems to me that we could handle that by just saying, well, there's not a separate product.             Do you think the existence of the laws of -- of -- the existence of the lawsuit -- of -- of the presumption is what drives a lawsuit?
04-1332 +++$+++         Well, I -- I take it Justice Ginsburg's point -- and it's my concern as well -- is that if the Bivens action is brought first, there's no protection of the Government against multiple actions.         So -- so the policy that you're arguing for just is dependent on which suit happens to be brought first.        And that's not -- that's not a very strong policy interest to vindicate by expanding the collateral order doctrine.        Well, it depends on -- it depends on -- on how the case was resolved.
04-1350 +++$+++               Well, would it be, would it be inadvisable for us to say the motive test teaches us something important; it has a valuable place; it's just not the exclusive test for what's obvious.              Or do we have to reject it all out of -- out of hand?                 Motivation in this special sense.                 But, but, but my question is does it not serve to show us at least one way in which there can be obviousness?                 It may not be the exclusive test.    We're -- I'm asking what the test ought to be.                No.      No.    No.   It took from 10 years to go from -- I think 10 years from Asano to Engelgau, so it must have been not all that obvious.                Do you, do you concede -- do you concede that claims 1 through 3 are valid?                If I had asked your opinion as an expert would you -- (Laughter.)             Well, I mean it seems to me that the whole argument that you're making as to Ford is that anybody knows you could, you use an electronic -- you have an electronic throttle, it serves a purpose; the pedal serves a purpose; put the two together.             Why doesn't -- don't 1, 2 and 3 do the same thing?             If they're invalid then I have -- then I'm struggling to find what your test is.             I don't know what your test is.             Going back to the asphalt case, were you suggesting that if they had made a claim for a process patent, that it might have been valid?             Do you agree that in that context it would serve a valid purpose, i.e., can we -- that is to say, can we keep the motivation test and then supplement it with other, with other means of, other ways of showing obviousness?              In this case, would there have been anything for a jury under your test?              What about claims 1, 2 and 3?             What about in this case where the wires were getting frayed until this disclosure?             So suppose I read the record the other way.       Suppose I read the record as saying this invention stopped the wires from being frayed and therefore it was an advance.
04-1360 +++$+++         Well, but just --        -- just on the point of the causal relation that the Chief Justice was exploring, I mean, there is a causal relation in a but-for sense.         We know that.          I suppose the position of the Respondent is that the minute there's an entry after the knock violation -- the no-knock violation - - the minute there's an entry, that injury ceases, so that it's different from a warrantless rummaging- around through drawers and so forth.                   I suppose that would be their argument.            We've been down this route before in other cases, like Wilson, but it's still a troublesome measure.              It's hard for me to believe that if a person has drugs in the pockets of his trousers or on the -- next to the chair where he's sitting, that he wouldn't immediately run and try to dispose them.          I just think that it's ordinary behavior.         And, if that's so, then it would follow that you never have to knock if you're looking for drugs that might be on the person.                    Do you have any comment as to that?          But --          But if we say that a likelihood -- or that the -- or substantial probability that the evidence will be destroyed allows the no-knock, why won't that be true in every drug case, other than for what we said in Richards?          I mean, do people say, "Oh, they've got me now.            I won't get rid of the drugs"?          Well, when there's probable cause to enter, there's no presumption of innocence, is there, or am I wrong?
04-1371 +++$+++ 
04-1376 +++$+++             Well, in this --            -- in this case, he was married after the effective date of the new statute.            Did Judge MCConnell, in the Tenth Circuit, suggest -- because he discussed this -- suggest that the result might have been different if the marriage had been before?            Why would that be consistent with his -- with his analysis?            Well, but --        -- it does point out that your argument is a difficult one, because this expectation that you argue for is that, number one, he has an expectation that he'd be able to adjust his status even after Congress has changed the law respecting reinstatement.        This is --        -- this is a far-reaching expectation on his part.
04-1414 +++$+++         What would prevent the issuance of just a blanket warrant?                    We have a warrant for this -- for this premises to be searched.         If they become aware, but the -- it's a big leap from that to say that they must make their own determination of probable cause.         You -- you indicated a warrant can't be served unless they determine there's probable cause, but that's for the magistrate to do, as Justice Scalia --        Well, there's no -- there's no authority for that.           I -- I thought warrants were issued to police officers all the time without knowing the -- the precise reason.             It's to search the house to try to find X, and the warrant speaks for itself.                    A judge has made that determination.        I mean, if you want us to write the opinion with this qualification in it, it seems to me that you're making a big change in the way search warrants are used.         Of course, that's not what the -- what the warrant says.               The warrant says I'm satisfied that the person or the property so described is now concealed on the premises.
04-1477 +++$+++           Does -- does it follow from your argument that someone who purchases at a tax sale, before they conclude the purchase, should find out what the State has done?          And the purchaser from that purchaser the same.            In other words, if Flowers had sold to X, then X has to make the same inquiry because he sees I guess what, a quit claim deed or a tax sale. So before a purchaser can purchase from Flowers, that purchaser too must see whether or not they hired an outside agency and so forth.        Well, isn't it required to do that under your title, if you're going to have your title set aside by Jones?        Well, what about the purchaser from Jones?           If -- pardon me -- from Flowers. If Flowers has spent the money, then that purchaser is out of luck.        So one of the consequences of your rule is to devalue any property sold by the government because it is open to this kind of challenge for deficiency in title.            So you've now devalued the property in the hands of the State.
04-1495 +++$+++           Suppose there is probable cause for a prosecution, but the prosecutors are extremely busy and they -- they have to select their cases and they select one in which they bring the prosecution against the defendant on account of his speech.        Is that a violation of the prosecutorial duty?          Yes.          I'm -- I'm asking is it a violation of the prosecutor's professional obligations and his professional duties?          Just going back to the hypothetical, if -- if you acknowledge -- and I think you must -- that there's a violation of the prosecutorial duty in -- in the instance I suppose, then why shouldn't the law recognize it and -- and give force to that sanction and give force to that rule?                  All right.   Well, then we'll just change the hypothetical to make it the investigators.            The investigators select their case based on this speech that they consider unwelcome.                  Well, does he have a right not to be singled out because of his speech?                  I asked does he have a right not to be singled out because of his speech.           In other words, you -- you would advise law enforcement officials that they can single out persons for prosecution based on distasteful speech.           What I want you to do is to agree.       I -- I think you have to concede there is this principle in the law, and I think your answer has to be even though there's that principle, there's a lot of problems with enforcing it because there are going to be too many suits, it's hard to -- it's difficult for the Government to defend, and -- and so forth and so on.
04-1506 +++$+++            Can you tell me?    It's my -- excuse me.            My understanding was that Arkansas had intervened in the suit.           So after the settlement, I take it Arkansas would -- still would have had the right to -- to pursue its claim in the litigation, or am I wrong about that?           That's what I don't understand.            How can they do that with -- with a party?             I mean, the -- and the reason -- the reason I ask is it seems to me that you still have the cause of action left.              Maybe that would be my next question. Suppose there's a settlement and you don't get, in the settlement, even earmarks, medical specialists, plus general damages, and you're -- you're unsatisfied.             Don't you still have the right under Arkansas law -- or do you -- to pursue the tortfeasor for the balance that's owed to you?        But we're asking how that can be.        We're asking you as a matter of Arkansas law.           Let me -- let me ask you this question so far as the rights of the assignee and the assignor.            Suppose it's a very weak case and the litigant says I want to settle for 20 cents on the dollar.        Are you saying that there's some kind of duty to notify the State and -- and to consult with the State before this is done?           Okay.     Suppose the -- the State says, well, we -- we don't -- we don't agree with you.      Then -- then what happens?               Then they're at loggerheads and you go to Justice Souter's position I suppose.           Would -- would it -- if -- suppose in the instance I put they -- the -- the State has -- has an objection, but the settlement is made, nonetheless, for 20 cents on the dollar.                 Do you still think you have the right to receive 100 percent of your payment from the proceeds in the case that I put?         Assume that it's a very weak case.          They settle for 20 cents on the dollar.            Do you have the right, as you understand the law, to insist that you receive 100 percent of your payments from the gross settlement?         The answer is yes, I take it.         The answer is yes, I take it.      In the case I put, the answer is you would think that you're entitled to 100 percent of your payments. So that eats into her general damages.        Well, I mean, why does there have to be enough money in the -- take -- take the -- the case that we -- we put to your co-counsel. Suppose it's a settlement for 20 cents on the dollar. Does the -- does the State have an absolute right to get reimbursement for 100 percent by invading the general damages portion of the settlement?        No, but in my -- can you answer the -- the question?             You have the problem. They settle for 20 cents on the dollar.                Does the State in that case have the absolute right to a lien or a claim or to a demand for the -- for the proceeds in -- for the balance of the 80 -- for the 80 percent balance of the medical costs?        But that is -- that is as between the State and the third party tortfeasor, not between the State and -- and the Medicare recipient, I should think.        Well -- well, if your rule is just one that you have to pay the 100 percent if there's non-cooperation and a non-notice, that's one thing.       But the briefs, it seems to me, indicate that you have an absolute right to 100 percent.             And those are two very different propositions.        I -- I know in the case of a jury.        But our question is what happens if there's a settlement.            Suppose the State was involved but disagreed.            Suppose the State -- suppose the State is involved in the negotiations and they disagree.            The -- the parties in good faith say, we've got to settle this for 20 percent.                      The State said, oh, your case is much better than that.                      Please don't settle.            Then what?            It has notice.       It's involved, et cetera, et cetera.
04-1527 +++$+++             Well, this --             But this is an important point for me, and I wasn't quite clear what the briefs told me about it.            My understanding was that there is an argument that when the water stays in the reservoir, the impoundment area, that there's a stratification, and the oxygen components at different levels change, so that when the water goes back into the dam, it's qualitatively different.               It's the same water, in a sense, but it's also qualitatively different in its oxygen and other characteristics.                    And that sounded to me like a discharge.               So, if --               So, if it were established in this case that the water is qualitatively changed in a significant degree because of its oxygen component, that would be irrelevant to the question you're asking?               Are you --
04-1528 +++$+++            Well, just --           Well, to get back to Justice Souter's questions, could you answer it this way?      Let's assume that some members of the Court simply accepted the proposition that money buys access. And -- and I don't think maybe we can take judicial of that, but I -- I think that's a common sense conclusion that we can reach.           And you tend to fight this in your brief to say that this doesn't happen.                  I tend to doubt that.       I tend to think money does buy access.             What -- if -- if we or I were to conclude that, what would follow?            All right.   Let's say it's privileged access.            I mean, isn't the answer that the -- that this is up to the voters.                  The voters can see what's going on and throw the legislator out if they choose.          It -- it is true that all the polls say that there's public disaffection and cynicism.         Does that translate into action to defeat incumbents who take particularly large sums of money? Is there -- is there statistical evidence to show that?        Well, suppose three legislators had been corrupted, venal, criminal corruption, actually taking no wink-wink, nod-nod, a specific agreement to vote for money.                 So what?    Does that change your case?        Suppose -- suppose that had been demonstrated in -- in a particular State.                   Does that mean, in your view, that a State can have strict contribution limits and support?        No.     It's true.   It's -- it's done.             There have been criminal convictions.            Well -- well, if -- if you -- if you concede and -- and you tend, at least, to back away from the proposition that the case I put would be an inadequate ground or an adequate ground for legislative limits, then I suppose you can say the State has the power to prevent this from happening to begin with.
04-1544 +++$+++            Well, it did involve, at least the bankruptcy court thought, the judgment invalidating the inter vivos trust.                      Was that necessary to the decision?           Or am I -- correct me if I'm --           -- correct me if I'm wrong about that.
04-1581 +++$+++ 
04-1618 +++$+++            Is -- is the failure to extend immunity to counties and municipal entities in a State just a historical relic?                It depends on semantics.          Or is there some normative or good government policy that dictates the distinction?            So it's -- it's a matter of respecting the dignity of the States because they participated in the Convention, the plan of Convention?            So it's a historical relic based on the dignity of the State, or the king in one case, and of corresponding lack of dignity of the entities on the other?        Would you -- would you say thoughtful rather than inflexible? (Laughter.)
04-1704 +++$+++ 
04-1739 +++$+++          Were there any prisoners, since the inception to your program, that have been in there for the whole 2 years?         Yes.         Are -- do -- is -- is Pennsylvania alone or nearly alone in imposing this rule, or is this typical of the restraints imposed in -- in this maximum restrictive confinement?        Is this one of the most severe restrictions in the Nation with respect to reading material and photographs?
04-373 +++$+++        Well, I --       -- I suppose that if they knowingly put death on in order to get him off his balance, that would be badgering, wouldn't it?       Well, but --       -- the initial question Justice O'Connor asked is, Do we consider these other factors?               And then -- but you're talking now about curing.       Well, but it --       -- it has to be --       -- voluntary at some -- if you held the man's hand to a burning iron, we would -- we'd say that's not voluntary.       So, it has to be voluntary, certainly, in the lay sense of the term.                   Then the law has certain accretive force when we talk about, you know, involuntary as a matter of law.               But what we're -- what we're talking about, it seems to me, is, rather, a commonsense inquiry as to whether or not it was voluntary, as to which I don't think you necessarily lose your case, but it seems to me that at least these have to be considered in determining whether or not it's voluntary.       Well, but I -- you can't initiate something involuntarily and have that count, can you?               You say --        -- let's say involuntarily, in the lay sense of the word, in the common sense of the word, where it was actually physically coerced.                That wouldn't count.        All right.        No, no, it's the --       -- first part of the analysis.        How --        The first part of the analysis is whether or not he initiates.       And you're trying to tell us that the initiation can be involuntarily?               I just don't -- I just don't agree with that.       I mean, you have to concede --        I think we can --        -- I think that's a given.     The question is whether or not he agrees -- he indicates affirmatively that he wants to begin talking.        That's --       -- the issue, it seems to me.          In fact, there was a finding that Johns' testimony was credible.       Well, I'm not so sure, because a voluntary waiver is measured against a Miranda warning.                  And, by definition here, you don't have a Miranda warning, because we're asking about "whether initiation."                 So, it seems to me there's a threshold inquiry of voluntariness to determine whether or not there was a voluntary initiation, and that that -- it does not comprehend or require a Miranda warning. Otherwise, you're double counting.       I agree with that.   But I want -- what I think the Court is trying to find is some explanation of the threshold test for determining whether or not there was a voluntary initiation.         Now, I think we agree -- or at least I agree -- that there shouldn't be any Miranda warnings required. That doesn't go into the mix.       Any new Miranda warning.       Yes.
04-433 +++$+++             Well, why -- why is that true?       Let's assume that they could establish that there was a purpose and an intent to adopt this -- this tax evasion scheme and that the whole object was to undermine and -- and injure the competitor, and they show that this scheme began to work and that their reputation as a lower-cost competitor was -- was well established.             Why -- why isn't that enough?
04-473 +++$+++            I suppose you have the rule which distinguishes between employment-related and outside speech, under the hypothetical -- difficult hypothetical posed by the Chief Justice, it would be an -- the promise would be an unconstitutional condition, or something like that.          I --          I suppose it's a hard case --
04-52 +++$+++           Just at the -- at the outset -- and I m -- I m not sure you re prepared for this, but the joint appendix, volume 2, is under seal, right?          In the course of the argument, I think we d be very interested in knowing about the colloquy that the trial judge had with the attorneys, and if it s under seal, it s a little bit awkward to do that.         Is there any reason that it has to be kept under seal?        I -- I take it --        -- I take it that the -- the names of the jurors we don t know because they re given numbers.        So far as you know, the counsel for the respondent would also have no objection?        Yes, it was then quoted extensively in the Ninth Circuit I thought.        Thank you.        And I -- I noticed the defense attorney, respondent here, did not comment in any way on the -- the demeanor of the -- of witness 16, which means either the -- he -- he saw it and said nothing or he -- he didn t see it at all.              We don t know.        What -- what is the obligation that we impose on the prosecution in this case to give a coherent explanation of why there -- the juror was excused?        That step has proceeded.         We re at that step in Batson where an explanation has to be given.       What -- what have we said about how coherent and complete that explanation has to be?        Here, it seems that the prosecutor was somewhat caught off guard or -- or certainly was not extremely clear.        Well, I m not so sure quickly.         They gave notice that there d be a Batson hearing.         She should have known what s going on.        But the point is once there s a Batson challenge, it has to be articulated.             Well, the question is would he --         Well, I -- I read it as saying, and therefore I m going to be careful about finding that there s been a Batson violation.                  And I wonder if that s consistent with what we want trial judges to do when they re hearing Batson challenges.
04-593 +++$+++         Can -- can you tell me, Ms. Mahoney, just in -- in a case where the person is directly implicated -- he was the one discriminated against.         He obtains in a suit the damages for the loss of the profits in the contract.               What are the other damages?         Does he get emotional distress?         And what was the plaintiff's -- it wasn't here.                What kind of damages was he asking for?            Suppose that MCDonald had had a contract with the corporation that he gets 80 percent of the gross from every contract.                        Could he then sue?            Well, but -- but in this case, it's pretty obvious they didn't care about the corporation.             They cared about him.             He was the target.        Are there any --        -- are there any cases where we pierced the corporate veil in order to help the shareholder?        This is kind of an inverse --        -- corporate veil piercing.        Well, in a -- in a sense this is stronger than some tortious interference claims because here the target is this -- this party.        You mean that -- that the injured party has to be the target?        To interfere but not necessarily to injure him.
04-597 +++$+++             Just while I have you, I'm -- just while I have you here -- it's not --            -- probably, directly relevant to this case.             On that one point, when I was in practice, it used to irritate me sometimes that the judge should grant the motion and then he'd just sit on it.                   But I see the wisdom for the rule now, and the judge reserving it, in the event the jury comes out the right -- the, quote, "right way," anyway.             What if there's a very long trial? What if, after the plaintiff rests, there's a good grounds for granting the motion for judgment as a matter of law, the judge doesn't do it, and then there's a 3-month trial? Do the judges ever take that into account?          Three more months for the defense to --          Yes.         Can you tell me, if we adopt your position, what should a trial court do if he, alternatively, would grant a new trial?                   Should he go ahead and make that determination?                 He grants judgment NOV.      And then he really is thinking, "Well, I would have granted a new trial."           Should he go ahead and cover himself against reversal by granting the new trial in the alternative, or --          "Shall."     It does say "shall.          It says "shall."    Thank you.
04-607 +++$+++            Is that second point -- is that second point definiteness?           Does definiteness describe this second aspect that you've just --           Just part of it.           It's indefinite because we don't know where our thoughts will take us?                   Suppose there a patent which requires looking at the clouds in the sky for 10 minutes.          I mean, that's maybe absurd, but it's certainly definite.             The opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the appendix begins discussion of claim 13 about page 16a.                      Are there some, one or two sentences there or a paragraph that you can tell me is completely wrong?            Yes.    You're asking us to reverse this court of appeals decision and I'm looking, and particularly with reference to claim 13, the one we're talking about, I assume, and I'm looking through pages, say, 16 and 21 to find something that's absolutely wrong.            You want me to tell the court of appeals, well, you can't do this.                        But where is it wrong?            So you can't point me to any particular sentence that -- that's absolutely wrong?            And where does it say this?           You see my point?     I'm not sure what it is you want me to say went wrong, other than the fact that this patent is, should never have been granted to begin with but that wasn't raised.          Well, if that's -- if there is some likelihood or possibility of this that we should assess, it seems to me that it's imprudent for us to discuss it here when it hasn't been discussed in the court of appeals.              You're urging on us something like plain error, is about what you're telling us.            So you agree or you submit that you can have a definite description of something that's unpatentable because it's too broad?          But, but, but -- well, let's assume that there is a claim that includes something that should not be patentable, because it's too broad or it involves the scientific phenomena, the mechanics of the universe.         Can a patent still be definite if it includes that sort of unpatentable claim?
04-623 +++$+++              Well, for me --       -- my question would then be, Isn't that an odd statutory scheme, where the Attorney General can find it to be an abuse of the use of the drug if the State of Oregon has specifically told its doctors, under special procedures in defined circumstances, that they can administer it?       Well, that's --       -- that's -- that's a -- the slipper-slope argument that I wanted to explore a bit.               If we do rule against you, and for the State of Oregon, on the statute, you do think that there will be some other serious consequence which will hinder the Department of Justice in an orderly implementation of this statute, particularly under the abuse formulation?        But part --        -- part of the regime referred to under the statute -- and it's 801(a) implementing the convention on psychotropic drugs -- and there, the implementation incorporates the treaty -- but it says that, "This shall not displace the judgment of the medical community, as determined by the Secretary."             And it seems to me that that cuts against you in this case.         Was the impact profound because they were in what's now schedule 1, that they were just prohibited?          In other words, were doctors allowed to prescribe opium for some purposes?
04-631 +++$+++        Well, but aren't they going to tell us that -- as a practical matter, that the tax is really being collected for the retailers?              It's just being passed on to the retailers, but paid by the -- I take it that the distributor -- the way this works -- I, again, had problems with effect -- I take it the distributor sends out a truck.            And if he sends out the truck to the tribe, then the distributor just pays the tax, and the tribe would want that tax to be -- that fuel to be distributed, less the cost of the tax.       And if the tribe view prevails, then the distributor still sends the truck to the stations that are in the State and passes on the tax for those --       -- distributors only.     I take it that's --         What about the Supreme Court's characterization of this as being --         Yes.
04-698 +++$+++         In all events --          -- in all events, it seems to me that it's still cut against you.                  This is a statutory scheme where, you point out, the parents have access to some initial consultation.              In most instances -- or in many instances, people who are suing an institution don't have that initial access.             Here, the parents get much more initial information than most -- than most petitioners do --          -- than most -- than most complainants, than most aggrieved persons do.          Then let --          -- let me point -- let me point out something else.             Let's assume a state of affairs -- just assume that school districts -- many of them -- independently and, I think, collectively, because school districts talk to each other -- have a growing body of data and expertise about IEP.                And this is the basis on which you say that they should come forward.                 It seems to me that, too, though, cuts against you, because when a school district has expertise, I think it's entitled to a presumption of governmental deregularity.                    And you have to challenge it.

04-721 +++$+++            Well, can't --           -- the -- can't the California courts adopt a -- give us a 60-day rule, or a 30-day rule, or a 90-day rule?                   And if they don't do it, why should we do it?
04-759 +++$+++           Do I understand that you would accept the rule that if Arizona held a private inspector liable to third persons for their injuries, then the Government of the United States would be liable?                     It's not quite the Good Samaritan -- not quite the Good Samaritan type, but you would accept that as the proper measure of your liability in a case like this?          Yes.          It gets ahead of the argument just a little bit, but you had a footnote about police officers.         You have a park ranger, Federal employer.                Is the analog there that we look to -- what the duties of a private security guard would be -- what do you do with those cases?          So, even with the police officer, I have to find a private analog.        Well, but it seems to me that that's quite a foreseeable possibility.                  If there is such a thing as private safety inspectors in Arizona -- I'm not sure, but if there are, I assume that what they do is, when they go into a particular industrial area, they look at the safety standards for that industry, including Federal and State regulations.               So, if you have a mine inspector, then it seems to me that his liability might very well be measured by whether or not he's inspected the mine in accordance to Federal safety standards.         Well, but I thought we said, at the outset -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- if Arizona imposes liability on private safety inspectors for injuries to third persons, then the United States would be liable here.         That was the --         -- hypothetical.         I understand.            It's just a background question.          I'm curious, was ASARCO sued here, or -- and is its liability capped by workmen's comp laws, or?
04-805 +++$+++           Well, taking that point just a bit further, your reply brief -- the reply brief for -- for Shell says that the respondent has conceded that the pricing decision to sell at the same price was not made till 8 months afterwards.                    I'm not sure that that's quite a fair statement.               That isn't inconsistent with its suggestion that there might have been an agreement even before the joint venture to have single pricing.         They just waited until 8 months to do it.               So I'm not sure that your yellow brief correctly characterized their position.               Tell me if I'm wrong.             Were the parties indifferent as to how much of each brand was sold? Texaco didn't care if Shell got 90 percent of the sales?       It just didn't care?        But -- but if they cared, doesn't that show that there was still an element of competition, but the competition is suppressed if the price is the same?        One more question and then -- how was it decided how much raw gas would be delivered to the venture by the two parties?          Mr. Minear, you've indicated that in the first 8 months, when there was differential pricing, you said that was the way to allocate profits. I thought they shared the profits on some other basis.
04-848 +++$+++ 
04-881 +++$+++        Are --       Are you saying that this has a purpose other than barring stable -- stale claims?                  It's simply designed to limit the offset provisions in order to allow other Federal programs to proceed and -- I'm looking for some way for you to describe (e) as being something other than a limitations provision.        Because I think that would help you.        Well, if --        -- if we call it "limitations," you have a much harder case, because of the 1991 Act.       Well --       -- can you give me a reason for the Government's adopting (e), the 10-year -- the 10- year bar, other than for stale claims or --       I understand that, but I'm just -- I'm just saying, if you could give me an explanation, a characterization, a description, a statement of purpose that's other than the bar on stale claims, I think you'd have a stronger case.              But it seems to me just like a stale-claims statute, so I go back and look for other limitations period, and I find it in 1091(a).       Of course, part of the problem is that 1091(a)(2), the "notwithstanding" clause, talks also specifically about offsets, which is what this is, I take it.       I mean, if it had said "no" --       -- "no limitations period," then I might -- this specifically talks about an offset.
04-885 +++$+++          Well, why don't we say that that's the exercise of the sovereign power of commerce, just -- of Congress, just like you said?              That --         I mean, it seems that that answer is just conclusory, that it's an exercise of the sovereign power of Congress, okay.        That's just -- that's just a conclusion. That's not a reason.         Well, do you think the waiver argument that's made is properly before us?         You may be right about that, but, while I've got you here, let's assume just one State entity, not multiple State entities.             And the State has received a preferential transfer of $2,000.               It still has an outstanding claim -- a different claim against the same bankrupt for $1,000. And it goes in to enforce its claim for $1,000.               Could we hold, consistently with the eleventh amendment, that that is a waiver?       No, different claim.     The --       One, the State received $2,000 worth of taxes, but it -- still have its $1,000 contract claim.         I'd like to get away from in rem and back to the waiver aspect that's being argued here.                  Let's assume that there is an offset obligation that the State has to comply with, that there's been a preference and it has another claim, and with just one entity.               If that's true, it seems to me somewhat unfair to say that the State can proceed on multiple fronts with different entities and fractionate its immunity so that if there are more than three entities -- or if there are three or four entities, each one is judged separately as to the offset obligation.        It seems to me that if one State entity is subject to offset, then all of them are.         Otherwise, the State immunity, it seems to me, can be -- can be fractionated.         But I --         -- I thought, with respect to Justice Ginsburg's colloquy -- and my own, earlier -- that we said that there is an offset obligation, even if they're different claims.         And now -- and now I want to extrapolate from that to multiple entities, each of which asserts its own immunity.
04-8990 +++$+++             I have two questions on the blood, and there's a lot you want to cover here, so I won't take too much of your time. One, is it significant for your case that this was a very small sample? Two, was the evidence about the enzymatic degradation -- was that available?                      Was the science about that fully available to the defense at the time of trial? I had those two questions.
04-905 +++$+++        Well, but -- I mean, you say that, but the title goes to the dealer.             The dealer makes the purchase.        Aren't you -- as I understand your answer to Justice Stevens, and also your answer to the Chief Justice, if these were automobile dealers that sold some inventory, there would be a cause of action if you extrapolate this -- these kind of facts.      One dealer being discriminated against, vis-a-vis another dealer.        Well, of course, if we can go back to the language, it's between different purchases of commodities of "like grade and quality."            And that seems to me to indicate that Volvo Trucks, generically, must be looked at -- the policy, with reference to Volvo trucks, generically.             Suppose one dealer always got a 10 percent discount, the other dealer always got a 20 percent discount over a period of time.        It has to be purchase-by-purchase to determine like grade or quality?        Two --        -- two dealers within 10 miles of each other, customers frequently go to both dealers to check out -- to get the lowest price.            Dealer A gets 10 percent discount routinely; Dealer B, 20 percent discount routinely.                  Over a period of time, would there be a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act?      Yes.
04-928 +++$+++         Well, I -- may -- I want you, perhaps, to elaborate on that, as well.               And perhaps the Respondent is the one to answer this question.         Do you understand that they, on remand, if they prevail in this case, would want to introduce the mother's live testimony?        We're not sure --        -- all right.         You want --         You want us to hold that. You want us to say that a defense counsel can be admonished by the judge not to make the argument that, "Ladies and gentlemen, this is the final penalty.                My client claims he's innocent.                If, in 20 years, it turns out that there is evidence exonerating him, it will be too late.         I want you to consider that and give him life."       You can't make that argument.        Let me --        -- ask you --         Well, on that --         -- on that substantive point, it does seem -- I assume a Governor could take this into account in clemency?         And I suppose the Governors can do more than juries can.                But, still, it seems odd to me that a jury cannot consider that this is a close case.       It's been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, of course.        It goes at least to whether or not the defendant is obdurate in not accepting guilt.                He says, "I didn't do it."           Well, no, the evidence goes to explain why the defendant is taking the position that he does.            He said, "I wasn't there."       Now, it's true, the jury, in the guilt phase, found that he was - -           -- at least it explains his attitude, his demeanor, his refusal to accept responsibility.           There's a reason for that.           Well, it would follow from that, that if a State wanted to exclude the defense evidence on alibi from a sentencing jury's consideration            -- let's assume it's a new -- a new sentencing jury -- they could do that.
04-944 +++$+++            In the first sentence, but not in the venue part.            I was going to ask what -- how does the waiver work?                 Suppose the judge pre- verdict says, you know, I'm concerned that there are less than 15 employees.                Can the plaintiff say, oh, well, now, Your Honor, you can't get into that?                       They waived that.            They didn't raise it.             I mean, how does that work?            Under your theory of the case?          You mean the judge just has to watch the case sail over the waterfall and --          Well, in my case nobody mentions it but the judge.          Yes, and the -- and the judge calls it sua sponte to the attention of the parties.
04-9728 +++$+++            Well, Justice Ginsburg, I suppose, can pursue her own line of questioning, but let me ask you this, because I -- her question suggests this, to me at least.             Suppose the parole officer said, "Now, look, I'm going to search you.                      If you don't consent, then I'm going to revoke your parole."           I --           I -- my question was a parole officer, and I'll get to police officer next.           When you see the --           -- person on the street, et cetera, et cetera.            Well, so that a --            -- so that a burglar could be searched for burglar tools --            -- but not for drugs?           And the drug addict can be searched for drugs, and not burglar tools?
04-980 +++$+++              Well, I suppose the reason behind this distinction -- and it's, in a sense, artificial, because we made it up -- I suppose the reason is that, in the "weighing" State, the concern is that if there is an ineligible -- or an invalid factor in the eligibility determination, it carries over with a degree of force and weight -- it's almost -- it's a presumption that the jury is liable to treat it -- or, at least the jury is liable to treat it as such.                     And I see that same aspect to this case, when the instructions refer -- as you indicated in your colloquy with Justice Souter -- that the instructions specifically say "any special -- any special circumstance which has been found."            Am I right that the special --        I have one background question.          And maybe I've missed something.         Number 14, "murder was especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel" -- taken alone, that would be vague.                 But I thought that in Profitt we said that if it were -- if there were a gloss given by the courts in interpreting that standard so that it was made more specific, evidenced in a pitiless attitude, pitiless crime, that then it was valid. Has a Federal court, or have we said, that this provision is unconstitutional?                Or do we just assume that in this case?        Or am I missing --        Yes.        Invalid as a matter of Federal law?        Okay.       So, now we have an extra layer of complexity, because something that's been held unconstitutional under State law is said to skew the weighing, if it is weighing, as a matter of Federal law.       All right.       Was it --       -- was it this case in which the Supreme Court of California made the definitive interpretation --       -- that this is -- what was --       Engert.   I can find it, thank you.         Well, of course, this goes to a question, really, for the Respondent.                It helps -- there is a paradox here.         To the extent that a State attempts to guide and to limit what the jury can consider in the selection phase, it's held to a higher standard.                There is -- there is certainly a paradox there.         Maybe --         -- so, in this -- or, weren't there previous California cases -- or, again, correct me if I'm wrong -- where California says the reasonable- possibility test requires the defendant to establish that the error was prejudicial?              I thought that was the California law.           Or am I wrong?
05-1056 +++$+++               Suppose the amount were trivial and you just wanted to get a resolution of this question?              Then there would be a case with a controversy problem, I should think.             Is the master disk a component?             What's your position?              Just the disk but not the information on the disk is the component.             But I still would like to know your position.     The golden disk is or is not a component?             But copies of the golden disk are or are not components?             Physical manifestation?             I suppose if you could, if you made 99 copies, those would be 99 components.               Then if you used -- if you're going to make 100 machines.              If you used for your disk the master disk for the last copy, then that would have been -- that would -- then the master disk would be a copy, a component of the last machine.             You make them abroad.              But if the disk, if the golden disk itself after they finish the copies, were used --              -- in a hardware, then that would be a component.              So are you saying that neither the source code nor the compilation are a component?              So that neither the source code nor the compilation are a component, save as, the compilation is put on a disk?              That seems odd.       I mean, Microsoft doesn't say please buy our disk because it's the prettiest disk in the business.              It says buy our program because the program means something.              Suppose you had a patent on a biological organism and it was contained in a little vial, and you shipped it abroad.                 Just by doing nothing at all, it grew, and it had -- it grew into 100 different parts.              Right.             Well, there can be a process patent.             Can have you have a copyright on a program?               Is that analogous to the source and the compilation, the source being the design, the compilation being the key?               Are you saying that the infringement act that happened in the United States involved no components?
05-1074 +++$+++                  But are you saying that the rule for paycheck decisions is different than the rule for other sorts of decisions?                 That seems to me to work the other way around, just like the case we've just heard argued in the last hour.               It's a question of specificity here.    If the, if the employee, he alleges that promotions were based on experience and the employee didn't have the experience because of past discrimination, why is that different than the paycheck rule?    I take it indicates that you would not allow the, a cause of action unless the discrimination was within the statute of limitations period?               Would that be true if there were a change in ownership of the company, so the discrimination originally occurred under owner A, then the company is purchased by owner B, completely unrelated, and the, the disparity is used for bonuses, etcetera?               Well, under the, under the answer that you gave to the Chief Justice and the rule you propose, what of the case of differing ownership?              Does he have to know that the present decision to continue the pay structure is discriminatory?               Well, the question is whether or not there was a discriminatory act and if the employer, let's say it's an employer that has just purchased a business, thinks that it's a neutral criterion to base wages or bonuses or increase on a prior pay scale and he doesn't know about the prior discrimination, why isn't that a defense?
05-1120 +++$+++               But at the outset, you made this, some of this perhaps reassuring statement that we need not decide about global warming in this case.   But don't we have to do that in order to decide the standing argument, because there's no injury if there's not global warming?             Or, can you show standing simply because there is a likelihood that the perceived would show that there's an injury?              What's your authority for that?     I have the same question as the Chief Justice.                I was looking at your brief for the strongest case. Suppose there were a big landowner that owned lots of coastline.    Would he have the same standing that you do or do you have some special standing as a State, and if so what is the case which would demonstrate that?              No, no.         I'm asking whether you have some special standing --              -- as a State and, if so, what's the authority for that?             Well, I don't know.       1907 was Georgia versus Tennessee Copper, and that was pre-Massachusetts versus Mellon.               That seems to me your best case. What about a small landowner?              I asked the question about a big landowner.              Suppose you have a small landowner and he owned a lot?
05-1126 +++$+++                But of course, there the legal standard was not clear.               And the Dura case, I looked at, and perhaps you disagree based on what you -- what I have just heard, and I thought Dura was a lack of proximate cause.           They just didn't show any relation between the injury they alleged to have suffered, and their own.               And that's the way I read Dura.             So in the negligently drove case, the plaintiff negligently drove over -- the defendant negligently drove over the plaintiff, if it's not specific as to time and place it must be dismissed?    If it's specific as to time and place it's, it withstands the motion?             What if it does say within the last 10 years.             Do you have a case, do you have a case I can look to that tells me that?
05-11284 +++$+++                Well, why can't we just read Nelson and then say in these cases whether or not it's correct?
05-11304 +++$+++                 Also on the same preliminary line of inquiry, are we in as good a position as the State court to conduct harmless error analysis, or can we or must we defer to the State court's harmless error analysis?              So that if there is an instruction given to the jury and it violates the Constitution, then we, as a de novo matter, can determine the harmless error, harmless error inquiry?              Well, is the level of harmless error determined as a matter of Federal or State law when there is a Federal law?                  Really.         You mean that they could have something that it has to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and we'd be bound by that?
05-1157 +++$+++  
05-1240 +++$+++               But, but you presume in your last answer that other than that, there is an absolutely fair prosecution.              I mean, why do we make that assumption when we start out with the allegation of a tort and a violation of the Constitution?                  I don't understand.              What about the fact -- suppose that there were even a more serious battery here, a broken limb or something.                  Would you have to sue for the damages for the battery right away?                  The police officers injured --              Well, what about this case?               I'm still, I'm still puzzled about my question.          Suppose there's a battery resulting in a serious injury to the defendant.                 Why is that the situation?                 But if does, then you wait?                 Are there many cases in which the rule of Stone versus Powell is inapplicable for that reason?              That in effect is saying we can't have a statute of limitations rule; we're just going to laches, we're just going to an equitable rule.              We're just throwing up our hands and saying there is statute of limitations statute of limitations.
05-1256 +++$+++                  In that respect, how does the -- there may not be a definitive authority by this. Oregon says that if a corporation commits manslaughter it's required to pay up to twice the amount the corporation gained by committing the offense --              -- is my understanding. Suppose a corporation in a hypothetical case commits five manslaughters.       Would they be liable -- and gained for $1 million.     Would they be liable for twice a million dollars in every manslaughter case?
05-1272 +++$+++                Well, suppose a company has a plan to defraud the Government and it use a certain chemical mix to save money and that's what the real fraud is.    And it puts it in place and it puts it in place in 1988.    And the -- and it has just two containers full of this.          And the relator knows about it.   The relator then quits.            Then for 10 years the company does the same thing, following the same patterns, same method, same improper formula. And he then rings -- he then brings this to the attention of the Government in the proper way and files a suit.    He cannot recover for the later action which was the same pattern, practice?
05-128 +++$+++           Is there anything in the statute which says how promptly the premiums have to be paid as it -- to -- to make it analogous, say, to withholding where you might have to pay every quarter on -- by a certain day?             Does -- does the statute regulate when and how promptly the premiums must be paid, or is that just all comprehended in the terms of the policy agreement?        No.    I meant the State workmen's comp law.        Well, I recognize there are different schemes.        The only one I'm familiar with is my former State.         But did I understand from your answer that in some or many of these States, the employer is free not to have insurance?             He can be self-funded?        And is there any requirement that there be an actual fund in place or is it just a general liability?        A bond.             Well, if there were letters of credit, why is Zurich injured?                     Because the letters of credit were not large enough to cover the premium liability?
05-1284 +++$+++              How, how do you distinguish your Blue Cross example from the instance where drug companies are doing testing required by the FDA?             Blue Cross is different because there they are acting as an intermediary of the Government?
05-130 +++$+++         Well, but --        Well, I'm -- I interrupted you. But the -- the business process point you give away fairly quickly.                I -- I thought that was rather substantial.             The whole point is, is that a business process patent is -- is difficult to define and could be very -- it can be very restrictive.            My concern is if you take that away, I don't know if you've got a lot left for the -- saying no injunction in this case.        Well -- well, tell me how -- how this works.        It seems to me that an injunctive hearing is -- might be the cheapest, most effective way to -- to sort out whether there's going to be a violation.          You call the parties in and they indicate what -- what they propose to do, and the judge says, well, this is within it or it's without it.              It's -- it's much cheaper than a -- a new lawsuit.         Well, but this gives you the advantage of coming in in advance saying, I want -- I -- I want a ruling in advance that I'm not going to violate the injunction.            You've got a cheap lawsuit.             Well, is -- is the troll the scary thing under the bridge, or is it a fishing technique?          I -- I want -- (Laughter.)             I mean, is that what the troll is?
05-1342 +++$+++                Well, I guess we can ask the respondents.   But is it your understanding that respondents take the position that the State has no control at all over whether or not the shares have been properly issued, whether or not certain accounting requirements applicable to all corporations have been complied with?               They say that there's no area of State law that is applicable to the subsidiary corporation?                 I could understand that with reference to just the amount of consumer loans, as Justice Scalia was talking about.                  But just to see if the corporation has a -- had -- had a meeting that year, has duly elected its officers under State law, do the respondents take the position you have no authority to visit the corporation to determine that?             Well, that seems to be a standard preemption case.          It's not as broad as just visitorial powers generally.            Maybe I'm wrong.     Do some subsidiaries of the -- of a national bank do things other than banking, say title insurance or something like that?   I don't see anything in the record where the OCC wants to displace the State as to that.               This is just a standard preemption case.               When the OCC has regulations that control, then the State has no authority to add to those regulations or to have, or to have contrary regulations.          But if it's something that doesn't have to do with banking at all, then I suppose they would say -- I can ask them -- I suppose they say the State has authority to regulate.
05-1345 +++$+++                Well, I'm not so sure.             Well, I -- is there a distinction between the question Justice Breyer put to you, the hypothetical of a municipal electricity company, and this case?        In this case you have private haulers, you have private waste dumps at the end, you just have a public, a publicly owned and mandated processing center in the middle. It would be as if in the electric case you have private electric companies that generate the power, private electric companies that distribute the power, but they all have to go through a Government-owned transformer at the key.        It seems that's the case you have here.             But you don't make that, that's not the argument you make.                 At least that's not the way you answered Justice Breyer.                 But, but then, but then Justice Breyer is going to say well, you --                 -- that you, that you can bar it altogether but you can't regulate it just a little bit --                 -- actually is greater than the sum of it.             It's a quite different assumption.             Well, what is your authority for the proposition that we use strict scrutiny?             Can you give me one case of it being strict scrutiny?             I mean, I just didn't realize that that phrase entered into our Commerce Clause jurisprudence.     Correct me if I'm wrong.              That is to say, if it discriminates?              But certainly on burden cases we don't require that.
05-1429 +++$+++               Can you tell me -- this is just basic bankruptcy.      I should know, but I looked it up and couldn't find it.        A standard promissory note which provides for attorneys' fees, the holder of the note is the creditor, the maker of the note is the bankrupt -- the maker of the note goes bankrupt.                The holder of the note gets his attorney and says:                File a claim in bankruptcy.     And the attorney sends him a bill. Is the attorneys' fees, the attorney fee for filing the bankruptcy claim, recoverable as part of the claim?              It's the standard, it's the standard attorneys' fee provision, all attorneys' fees in connection with collection of this note and enforcement of the terms of this note.              Is there something where I can look that up in Collier?            Are there millions of cases?   I mean, this seems to me fairly rudimentary.              No, no.          But in my case, it's a post-petition action.              Just in the hypothetical, I would think that in many cases, there's going to be some payout for the promissory note, and the holder of the note tells his attorneys:             Make sure I get that claim in bankruptcy.      The attorney files a claim.            And every attorney that files a claim for a promissory note which is entitled to a fee from the bankruptcy court for filing in the bankruptcy court.             Are they --                 Let me just ask you about the Fobian, and I know Justice Breyer has a question. Let's assume that you're correct in that the fees are allowable.       Can the bankruptcy court make the determination of the reasonableness of the fees?                 In this case.                 So -- so if the bankruptcy judge isn't sure of what the amount is, he looks to State law to determine the amount?                 But the bankruptcy court does determine reasonableness.              No, no.         But -- but we are talking about attorneys' fees for services performed in the bankruptcy proceeding?              The cost of filing the claim, the cost of talking to the bankruptcy judge, et cetera.                 If you prevail, why can't every attorney who represents a creditor who has a credit card or a promissory note providing for attorneys' fees file something in bankruptcy and get attorneys' fees for the filing of the claim?
05-1448 +++$+++               Well if you're correct and this was a sponsor decision, not a fiduciary decision, let me ask you when you're wearing, when the company is wearing its sponsor hat and says we're going to terminate this plan, does it have a duty to consider the best interests and the security of the employees, number one, when it picks an insurance company?                     It can't pick some flaky insurance company if there is a much more solid insurance company, can it?                  But if have this duty to consider the interest of the employees in selecting the, the insurance company, in selecting the amount of the annuity, etcetera, if you have that duty it seems to me that that's a fiduciary duty.                 I agree with Justice Scalia, that that's one answer.                On the other hand, you have -- there are two arguments here.                      And what we are exploring now is whether this is a fiduciary obligation or a sponsor obligation.                 So we will have to assume for that -- if you can't do it by merger, then the whole case goes away anyway.         If merger is not permitted under the statute, then we don't need to worry whether it's a fiduciary response, correct?                 So what we're asking in the first part of this argument is whether or not it's a fiduciary response.       And that's what Justice Souter and I are questioning.      And it does seem to me, assume that there is a meeting of the board of directors, we think we are going to terminate this plan.                      At that point, choices are made as to how to terminate it.                      And it's difficult for me to see why the interests of the employees are not uppermost in -- in your duties, i.e. a fiduciary duty, when you decide how you're going to terminate it.             Why can't you say it's a business decision as to which insurance company you're going to select.   Maybe you do say that.             Well, but that's the way you characterize it.      I don't know why it's mere execution, when it's an annuity and it's not mere execution when it's a merger, once the determination decision has been made.                 But Justice Alito's question, and I have the same question.                   Let's assume, A -- I know this is not your position -- but the merger is a permissible option.          And B -- and I know this is not your position -- that this is a fiduciary obligation.    I assume then you would lose, because the extra assets must go, the reversion interest, must go to the employees if it's in their benefit.             But then you say that if it's a fiduciary obligation, and the merger is a permitted option, that the administrator, A, can, or B, must still give the money back to you.               The administrator, as a fiduciary, can consider the interest of the employer as well as the employees?               Could an administrator make that decision in its fiduciary capacity?              Could a plan document provide that upon termination the employer is entitled to a refund of any excess funding?                  And would that then be binding on an administrator in a fiduciary capacity?              And I take it the administrator would then have the duty to obey that?               Then why couldn't the PBGC say, you know, we are not quite sure how these insurance companies work.    So we'll buy the annuity and then the five million is an extra guarantee to make sure the annuities are paid and that also goes to the insurance company?
05-1508 +++$+++                But you have the same problem if it's students, I take it?                     You'd have the same statistical question whether you, you use districts or students?             I see your white light is on.   I don't want to take -- would the other States make that same answer that you just made?
05-1541 +++$+++                The Government does cite the principle that when there's a specific statutory scheme that controls over a more general one.                   It doesn't cite a tax case for that, at least as I recall. Has that principle ever been applied in the tax code, do you know?             Well, I suppose -- tell me if I'm wrong, or the Government can tell me if I'm wrong -- but there is this difference also that in a refund suit, you have to pay the money.                The Government has the money before you can bring the refund suit.                Am I right about that?              Incidentally, I'm just curious, if the underlying assessment -- if you wished to have challenged the underlying assessment, it's for a million dollars, can you pay $100,000 and then bring the refund suit in order to test the validity of the tax, or do you have to pay the whole amount?              Well, your argument is probably based on the statute.              I just question one phrase you mentioned, which was that Williams was not driven by the equities.        It seems to me it was wholly driven by the equities.              Getting back to my earlier question, if there is a million-dollar tax liability, and there is a levy on the bank account for $100,000, do you have to pay the extra 900,000 before can you bring the refund suit?              So that's, that's also a difference.               And both statutes in Kreider I take it applied to the refund suit?               So there were two statutes bearing on the same remedy.
05-1575 +++$+++               Well, I don't know if you got to the third point you were going to make.                You were outlining three different points.                But it seems to me that from the very start, what happens is that you and your brother for the respondent are talking past each other.   You want to talk to us about the adequacy of the State court's finding.       The respondent says what we -- all we want is a hearing in the district court, and those are two different issues. We want a hearing in the district court, i.e., so that we can show the findings are insubstantial or incorrect.   Those, it seems to me, are two different issues, and I sense the briefs are talking past each other on this point. Did you see the same thing?                In your view, what is the standard for when the district court may hold an evidentiary hearing?       I know there's an element of discretion in it.                That's the only time the district court can hold a hearing?               Yes, but it seems that if he doesn't do that, then that's a bar.                  But if he has done that, when can he ask for a further hearing?              Well, on the waiver point, let's assume that this case had not come in -- come here, and you had gone back to the district court pursuant to the order of the Ninth Circuit. Surely you would have taken the position, or you could have taken the position if the evidence developed that way, that he really knew or should have known about all this mitigating evidence and he waived. You certainly could continue to take that position in the district court.              And the district court would say I now have a more full, factual record, and I make the finding that there was knowing waiver, or there wasn't.             But doesn't that assume that the defendant know what mitigating evidence is?                      I mean, this defendant, I suppose wants to show, "I thought mitigating evidence was just going to be what the, these two relatives were going to testify to. There was really much more, if my counsel had investigated."    And that's not a knowing waiver.
05-1589 +++$+++               Well, I wanted to ask about that.    Suppose Washington says that as a matter of Washington law we are bound by our interpretation of purpose and we interpret the statute according to that purpose.    You use the words "plain language" a few minutes ago.              Are we free to disregard that and to say.    Oh well, we're just going to follow the plain language?              Like the says that was argued, the first case this morning?              But that's a Federal, a Federal statute and this is a State statute.                  If the State court says, we're interested in purposes, we decided, and you must as a matter of State law interpret the statute according to the purpose as we found it, aren't we bound by that?              What's your authority for that?              Well, that's because the characterization had a Federal consequence.              Do you agree with the court's conclusion that constitutionality is at issue here?              Isn't it your position that this statute is constitutional either way you interpret it?               But Washington -- at a minimum, I would assume that the Washington Supreme Court would not have constitutional avoidance as a crutch in order to reach that, to reach that conclusion, because there is no constitutional issue here under your view.
05-1629 +++$+++               Would it be completely inconsistent with Taylor versus United States for us to say that when there is a novel or an unusual theory of potential liability such as proposed by the respondent, which would exonerate him from application of this statute, that he has the burden to show that that's what happened?              Would Taylor allow us to do that sort of burden shifting?              And so your general rule to accomplish your objective would be?
05-1631 +++$+++              Is the rule that you propose that the policeman must balance the risk of harm to others versus the risk of harm to the fleeing person?             Your brief says that the officer reasonably believes that doing so, i.e., terminating the chase, would avoid a greater risk of bodily injury or death.             Greater than what? Greater than --              Without reference to the possible harm to the driver?             I just want to know what you're testing.               I didn't mean to put words in your mouth.   It seems to me your test might be whether there is a greater risk in stopping him or not stopping him as to other people, without reference to the risk to himself.               Well, it's your brief.   I want you to --             I thought we had a test for deadly force in Garner and it's whether or not there is -- it's more likely than not, whether or not there is a serious risk that death will ensue.                  That's the test, Garner.              Well, that's a different issue and you may prevail on other arguments in the case.   But as to whether or not there's a likelihood or a reasonable likelihood of serious injury, it seems to me that's clearly a question for the jury.              I mean, we might argue about it up here, but that's classic jury question, isn't it?              I would think that would apply to all high-speed cases; would you not agree?             But your position would be the same even if Scott knew that the only reason they were trying to stop him initially was the speeding violation?
05-18 +++$+++            I -- I would have thought that your answer would be that the Congress was interested in finding out the cost of this act, and it's very clear that school districts hire consultants to assist them in -- in these cases, and it wanted to know the amount they were paying to the consultants. And that's also why it used the word personnel, which -- which is a word usually reserved for a government agency.        Well, but I'm not -- I'm not sure that you don't have a further answer to Justice Stevens because there's (3)(A) and (3)(B). (3)(A) talks about costs and expenses awarded to the prevailing party.        (3)(B) says, for the same sample the number of hours spent.           I think we have said that conference reports are more valuable than the reports of a single house.           I think we have said that.        Does the gravamen --        -- does the gravamen -- well, I'll let you finish your answer.        Does the gravamen of the argument -- is it that this phrase is unambiguous?           Don't the school boards have some consultants and experts in this area other than the teachers?
05-184 +++$+++              And suppose you had a tribunal that was properly constituted, as you contend that it ought to be, and then the charge was conspiracy.                  Would the -- would the courts then have review before the trial proceeded?             And let's assume that it's a conspiracy and some other charge.             Is there some analog in ordinary criminal proceedings where you challenge, in advance, the validity of the charge?            Could the tribunal interpret the conspiracy charge to mean joint enterprise, which would be closer, at least, to accepted practice in the international tribunals?            I'm still not sure why, if we think that there is merit to your argument that the tribunal is not properly established anyway, that you -- we have to reach the conspiracy charge.          And if we -- and if we think that you're wrong on that, I don't know why that court can't hear the conspiracy argument.            Well, suppose that proof were to show that there was very substantial and knowing involvement rendering him basically an accomplice or a principal, but it was -- it was still found under conspiracy.            Would international law violate that?            Assume that he's been given notice of -- during the -- during the course of the proceedings as to what the charges specifically are as the proof is adduced.           Well, let me put it this way. If we were to find that the Geneva Convention or other settled principles of international law were controlling here, why couldn't we just remand to the D.C. Circuit and let it figure that out?             Or let it -- have the tribunal figure it out, in the first instance, assuming the tribunal is properly authorized.           Well, suppose we told the D.C. Circuit that the Geneva Convention or some other body of international law controls, and just remand it for it to go into all these arguments?          What fundamentals, other than personal presence, are you concerned with in this case?          Or is that it?          I understand --          -- the nature -- the appointing authority and so forth.                    But so far as the rights of the defendant at the proceeding --          -- just right to be present? Is there a requirement of prompt convening of the proceedings?             Do you think, as a minimum, that they authorized a military commission?        How do you want us to view his status?        Do we accept the Government's submission that there's probable cause to believe that he was not of -- in a formal uniform, that he was not a formal combatant, but that he was aiding and abetting, or conspiring, with al Qaeda?       Can we accept that, that there's probable cause for that?        I mean, in -- particularly based on the CSRT hearing?        But you have to --        -- you have to give us --        -- a beginning point.     You have to give us a beginning point.
05-200 +++$+++         Well, I thought -- I thought it defined a duty.             I -- I agree with Justice Stevens.         I -- I've never seen it -- are there other statutes where the contracting parties can decide whether or not they're going to oust Federal law -- or State law?
05-204 +++$+++             But what's the -- I'm -- as Justice Scalia, I'm interested in the section 25 problem.         The briefs --            -- for your co-counsel don't talk much about it, and it's -- it's a problem for me. Justice Scalia's point was let's assume -- and I have some doubt about it.                 Let's assume that there's a valid reason for redoing section 23.                 That means you need another district to avoid retrogression. What is -- what is your position as to district 25 on that assumption, based on that assumption?          Well, can the -- can the State by its action with one district, i.e., 23, in effect bootstrap itself in a position where it's entitled to use race where -- in a -- in a predominant and I -- I think insulting way and -- and then have a defense?        And that's a --            But you don't think that's a defense.             It seems to me the State creates the very problem that it claims that it must use race to settle.        Well, but let's get back to the -- to the principle without just talking about these -- these factfindings.              It -- it seems to me very odd for you to be telling us that partisan gerrymandering is -- is improper when that's the sole or substantial, predominant motivation, but then saying that we can't correct it when it's happened. Let's assume that the 1990 legislative plan was one that was done with -- without a wholly partisan intent, but over the years, it -- it now freezes in the Democrats or party X to having a much greater advantage than the general registration would give it.                    And if it leaves it in for a particularly partisan purpose, why -- why can't it be redone?            I just don't understand that argument.          Well, if you say that mid- decennial districting is suspect or subject to some special rules, then it seems to me that you're -- you're taking away a very important deterrent that works on legislatures when they do decennial districting.           If you know as a legislature, when you do a decennial districting, that your program is going to be presumptively valid or not subject to partisan gerrymandering, then -- then you're -- then you're liable to overreach.            And it -- it seems to me very dangerous for this Court to take away that control mechanism that exists so that legislatures know that there's a possibility that if they overreach, they can be corrected.          Well, we're not -- we're not trying the court for a bad intent.                  We're looking at the effect of what it's done, and if the effect of what it's done is to leave in place something that's slanted based on -- on statewide registration in favor of the Democrats, then -- then, it seems to me, there's -- there's a ground for the new legislature to act. And -- and one -- one reason legislatures may not have redrawn plans often is because they always protect incumbents.            But you're making the assumption that a mid-decennial districting is not interested in compactness, it's not interested in counties, it's not interested in keeping a university within one -- within one district.                      That's -- that's just simply not true.        But -- but if -- if your -- if your test is that section 2 ought to be opened up to any racial group that could influence an -- an election, I don't see the limits on your principle.        No.     Suppose there's a primary where it works that they can get on the ballot. Suppose we're looking at the general election.        Accept the hypothetical.            In 23.          Focus for a minute just on the -- what we can call the removal, the drawing of the lines to exclude some Latino voters.                     Just focus on that, not the later justification.                      The district court found that this was for political reasons, not racial reasons, even though it was a largely racial group that was removed.           Do you attack that finding as clearly erroneous?           Well, but -- but that was because it was deliberate in that case, and that's not the hypothetical that Justice Scalia has posed.           But that's not the hypothetical that was posed to you by the Justice.        As I -- as I understood it.            Well, can -- can the State use race as the means to an end of electing a new candidate that the race wants?                   And what should be the difference?            I mean, it sounds like you're going to say race cannot be used as this basis, but how can race be used not to protect an incumbent but to allow the group to choose the representative of its choice and then reelect him every year?
05-259 +++$+++            Well, how about excluding from the forklift forever or a year?                      You can't work the forklift for a year.           Well, it has an effect on your back.           Yes, but you've got a jury --           -- you've got a jury finding here.            You've got a jury finding this was discriminatory.
05-260 +++$+++         But I don't understand.             But I -- I still don't understand.              If I'm the -- the trial judge and you ask -- and I'm asked to enter an injunction, I enter an injunction knowing that in the end it's going to be to no purpose?              I have to -- I have to be enforcing some ultimate injury of -- of which the plaintiff has standing to assert.             So that's why I don't understand your questions.                  I would think you'd say no injunction because, at the end of the day, it amounts to nothing.
05-352 +++$+++            Well, that was my -- even in the Chief Justice's hypothetical, I -- I take it the client has a right to direct the attorney what defense to present, or am I wrong about it?          What would the Government's position be if the disappointed client whose choice of counsel was rejected by the court applied for mandate review in the court of appeals?         Well, we don't know -- we don't know if that's the case.                He -- he wants to go immediately to the court of appeals.                    What would the Government's position be?         But the Government always acquiesces in the propriety of seeking mandate from the court of appeals?        Well, I mean, I suppose the Government can object that it's improper or that it's unnecessary or a waste of time.               I'm asking what the Government's position is.        Well, if -- if the question is fairness, as you -- as you propose, then it would seem to me that there would be no need for the extraordinary proceeding.        Would you say that presumption is sufficient so that mandate should be entertained by a court of appeals anytime this question comes up?         Well, in -- in hindsight, you've always made a mistake if your client is found guilty. I -- I'm just not sure how this inquiry would proceed.         It seems to me that there ought to be either automatic reversal on one -- on one hand, or the other rule ought to be incompetency of counsel.                But you're -- you're going to have satellite litigation with speculation, and it seems -- it seems to me not a good remedy.
05-380 +++$+++               Well, those doctors testified in the congressional hearings or in the Eighth Circuit or Ninth Circuit or the Second Circuit?                 There are so many doctors here.         Which are the two that you're referring to that do not dilate the cervix fully?                    Did they testify in any of the district court cases?                Can you tell me a hypothetical instance in which where an as applied challenge could be brought if we sustain the statutue on its face?    The procedure has to take place within 24, 48, 72 hours.    How would as applied challenge take place? You know, I read all the doctors' testimony in this case, hundreds of pages, and I'm familiar with the area generally.     But it takes a while to get up to speed.   I don't know if you could just go to a district judge and say I need an order, the judge would take -- would have to take many hours to understand that.             Why isn't that already in the record in the Ninth Circuit, in the Second Circuit and in the Eighth Circuit, in the district courts, proceedings in those circuits?              General Clement, I'm just thinking, trying to imagine how an as applied challenge would be really much different from what we have seen already.
05-381 +++$+++               Was there any argument in the trial court or in the briefs of the Court of Appeals as to how to calculate cost?              You basically have two markets.     You don't usually think of cost when you buy something.     But was there any argument as to how to determine whether or not this was below cost in the Brooke Group sense?              But that was the end of it at the trial court.              It's not clear to me that we have to get into this but if we do, I'm not sure about your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question.           If you have your own logs that you own already and if you have logs on a long-term contract, the only relevant logs are the logs that both people are competing for. That's the only relevant market that we are talking about insofar as the purchaser is concerned.              And if Weyerhaeuser wanted to drive somebody out of the market, then they go after the logs which are open to both parties.             Why is it so hard if you take Justice Stevens' premise that there's an agreement and we take that as a given, as a given premise?
05-409 +++$+++            And for this Court, I assume, at least theoretically, on petition for certiorari?           What -- what was the basis then, or was there a basis, for Judge Easterbrook's comment, it's now or never?           Do we have a standard --        Do you agree that there would be Federal court review in this Court from a State court determination on the applicability of SLUSA in this case?
05-416 +++$+++           Would you agree that there's a requirement that the exhaustion period be reasonable?        Is his best case, your brother's best case, in your view -- and you probably -- may not think of it as a very persuasive case -- Fay and Noia, is that the closest Respondents can come?       You --       Could --       Would Respondent tell us, well, that at least in some administrative law schemes, generally there is a requirement that the exhaustion period must be reasonable?
05-465 +++$+++         If we were --
05-493 +++$+++                Well it was --               -- it was addressing itself to the fact -- to the words of the factor (k) instruction. How does post-crime prison conduct reduce the seriousness of a previous crime?   Well, I mean, it has to relate to the gravity of the crime, under the words of factor (k), doesn't it?            Well, now, do you --            -- do you have an instruction that supports what you've just told us, that the jury is told they have to make a single moral determination?                 Is that what the court instructed the jury?                 Or was --            -- instructed in items of factor (k)?              And I think you have to rest on your argument, that what we are talking about is the gravity of his crime "for purposes of sentencing."                   I understand that argument.           But then, when you go on to make the argument you just made, the jury understands it is a single moral judgment, what -- is there some specific instruction you can point to, other than the factor (k) instruction itself?
05-502 +++$+++            Did they know that minors were involved?           The record doesn't show that, at least in the preliminary direct exam of the officer.           Yes.     I mean, they knew that once they got into the backyard.                      Did they know before they got into the backyard?           Or did they just know that minors stay up late at night?           But that's after they went into the backyard.           They could see that they were minors.         Well, that's just because it's loud?          Suppose they were just singing and laughing?         So there has to be some indication of the likelihood of escalation into violence?             So then it does matter.            Necessary.
05-5224 +++$+++         How does the fact that it's sole proof mean that it's testimonial?        I -- it -- it adds to the general appeal of your case I -- I suppose, but what does that have to do with whether or not it's testimonial?
05-547 +++$+++             Well, do you agree that if there were a State conviction for an offense that would have been punishable under the Federal law, their both being felonies, that enhancement can apply, in that instance, and that that does meet the definition?           But I thought that --           -- was the concession you made in response to my --           -- question.              You've --              -- answered Justice Breyer by citing the Jerome case.        After Jerome, we decided United States vs. Gonzales, having to do with the consecutive or concurrent sentencing terms.              And it -- are those two cases in some tension?       Gonzales didn't mention Jerome. And I noticed that none of the briefs mentioned it either. Is there some tension in the cases?                And, if so, is this a case where, when we write an opinion, whatever the outcome, we should talk about that?                And, if that's so, what should we say?              But it does --              -- it does seem to limit the broad statement in Jerome, without mentioning Jerome.
05-593 +++$+++              But I think Justice Ginsburg's point, and it concerns me as well, is that the Government is entitled to say that during the time the event occurred, i.e., the firing, he was on duty and he refrained from committing any unlawful act.                 Well, but the question is what the district court should examine, and the statute talks about the incident out of which the claim arose. So that necessarily requires the Government to look at the complaint, see the incident out of which this claim arises, whether or not the claim is true, and to certify it.                 "Out of which the claim arose" it seems to me is of some importance.                But the dissenting judges in the First Circuit case, Wood, didn't think it was important.           I'm not sure they were right about that.
05-595 +++$+++                  What is the source of the rule in Teague?     Could Congress overturn the rule in Teague if it wanted to and say that nothing is retroactive or that everything is retroactive?                Crawford did use the term bedrock?              Well, there is a new emphasis on cross-examination.             Well, there wasn't cross-examination by defense counsel.             In this case there wasn't cross-examination by defense counsel.                    Or am I incorrect?             Oh, oh.         No, I mean of the witness.
05-5966 +++$+++         Is --        -- the State telling us -- and we'll ask the State when they argue -- but is the State telling us that it has defined "intent" in a particular way for this, so that "intent" is just having the purpose to cause the result --        -- and, therefore, that this testimony is irrelevant?              Is that the State's argument, as you understand it?             Well, I guess maybe the question is, What is your point?                     And I have the same question as Justice Breyer, and I'd just like to pursue that. If a case, a hypothetical case, is one in which the second prong of M'Naghten, knowing the difference in right and wrong, gets to the question of his capacity to form an intent, isn't that sufficient? I think that's Justice Breyer's question.             But let's --             -- let's assume that it can consider the evidence as to -- on the right-and-wrong prong.        Does the hypothetical state --        -- that says, "We'll let this evidence" --        -- "in under the right-and- wrong aspect of M'Naghten, but not under the nature and quality of the act."        Why that isn't sufficient to answer your contention that his intent is not -- has not been subject to question.        What they said --         Well, I'll look at M'Naghten.          I had thought it was whether or not the action was right and wrong, whether -- rather than the -- than the -- than the moral command was wrong.         Well, but --         -- if Justice Breyer --         But if Justice --         -- Breyer's explanation is a correct statement of Arizona law, do you still have an argument that your proof should have been accepted, on the first prong?         And what is that argument?        Is it your argument that it -- under Arizona law, it goes to excuse the conduct, but not whether the conduct, in fact, occurred?        I mean, is that your argument?            Is that your argument?
05-5992 +++$+++             You're not quite through your answer yet, but is there also a requirement that the competency determination be made within 30 days? Or am I -- am I in error on that point?            But that -- but that's different, I take it, from the judge's delay in making the finding of competency.          And I take it the trial -- the Speedy Trial Act doesn't say if the judge is thinking about something, it requires him to make an order.          Well, I was going to ask you about that.          Or could he vacate submission because he wants new evidence or something?                      Could you vacate submission of the -- of the first competency hearing in order to take new evidence?             Now, we've been talking about the competency period.                   I take it the first period was one of just repeated requests for extensions.              That's January '97 until May '97.             And that's this -- that's the first of the two periods that's involved here.            I don't know if it makes any difference to the case.                 Do you -- do you think the court could have made findings that would have been justified?          I mean, it takes a while to find an expert to say that a bond is genuine when it spells United with O, but -- (Laughter.)            Are there -- are there cases in which the judge's findings -- let's assume that he made the findings -- are set aside for abuse of discretion on -- on review for a violation of the Speedy Trial Act?          I was going to ask what is the date of the Speedy Trial Act?                  1975?          And it was widely publicized among the judiciary then.
05-608 +++$+++                Well, but as a matter of policy, we, at some point, either in this case or some later case, may have to address the question of whether or not such a provision is enforceable.                       If it is, we may be -- not be talking about much.                It's just going to be boilerplate in every license agreement, and that's the end of it.   And it --               -- but it -- on the other hand, it may be that there are reasons not to enforce this, so that we don't have courts flooded with lawsuits, et cetera, et cetera.
05-6551 +++$+++             I thought your position was that aggravation must be reasonable.                What the court in Black indicates is that it is not going to consider anything reasonable unless there's a fact to support it, unless there's a finding of fact to support it.                  Is that the position you take?            But I think that there's the further indication that it is not going to be deemed reasonable unless it is supported by a finding of fact, as indicated in order to support one of the specific guideline aggravators.          No, but a reading of the rule indicates under (b), as the Chief Justice points out, that the judge could take into account these policy objectives.           Well, I think it is true that it doesn't seem to be involved in this case.                  In this case, we're under 4.420.
05-669 +++$+++          Mr. Lamken --         -- could we go back to Section (i) for a second more?    Is it also possible to say that there was this disagreement between the Department of Justice and the Comptroller General, and Congress decided that the Comptroller General was right?             And, if that's true, should we not accept the Comptroller General's reading of the entire statute?
05-705 +++$+++          Suppose it issued the regulation after notice and comment, and said -- violation of the pay phone order is an unjust and unreasonable practice, would the case be different?
05-7053 +++$+++            Which is the easier of the two cases for the defendant?                  A, the case where the argument is a burden of proof should be on -- on the -- the State as a due process matter or a common law matter in an insanity defense and, B, in a duress defense?           Well, either way.           But -- but we've held, at least under the M'Naghten version of the defense, that the State -- that the burden can be put on the defendant to show that he was not insane under the M'Naghten test.           And as Justice Scalia said and as I was considering in asking my question, in your case we know that there was a conscious, knowing and intentional, in some sense, act when -- when the person bought -- bought the weapons.                 She says the intent, of course, was induced by -- by the threat.                  It seems to me you have a more difficult case than in the insanity case.           The phrase Justice Harlan used in the Davis case.           What -- what is the threshold test that the defendant has to cross before the judge will give the instruction to the jury? Obviously, the burden of production is with the defendant.          When can a judge say, well, you know, this -- this is just too flimsy for a duress defense?                   I'm not going to instruct a jury on that.           Can the judge ask the defendant to produce evidence that there was no possibility to go to law enforcement officials, and if she does not produce that evidence, then refuse to give the defense?
05-7058 +++$+++               Suppose the district court finds that in its experience, 80 percent of the claims are ones that are unexhausted, just assume that.             And the district court said, the only way I can figure out the good 20 percent from the 80 percent that are going to ultimately be dismissed is to have a motion for a more definite, an order for a more definite statement, because I'll do it sua sponte under 12(e), I think.                Can the district court do that?              The court could ask for a pleading which set forth the facts of exhaustion?              Then why isn't this -- this is just the same if the court has said, you know, in order to make our screening function efficient, we just have to know about exhaustion.              How about, what, if you concede the district court could do it in individual cases or in most cases, why can't the Sixth Circuit do it?   That's my question.              Is there any argument that if the state does not insist on exhaustion or plead exhaustion, that it just drops out of the case?                 If the state resolves the case on the merits even though there is no exhaustion, can the Federal court hear it, that there is general agreement about that?
05-746 +++$+++           But I thought you argued the Rogers standard was a correct standard in the Missouri court?        How is the blue brief in response to Respondent's argument?         And I would add to that that we don't usually look at a BIO to see the issues that the Petitioner is presenting.
05-785 +++$+++           Well, I suppose if the court of appeals had case A, and it said, we interpret the Supreme Court rule to be as follows, it could then later say in case B, this is how we've interpreted the Supreme Court rule, and we're bound by case A.                 This is the elaboration we've given to it.      And we have to find that the state court, of course, isn't bound by what we do, but we're bound by what we do when we review what the state court has decided.          Suppose all of the -- suppose there are five circuits.        They're the only ones that looked at the issue.     And they all say, we think the general rule of the Supreme Court is as follows, isn't that entitled to some weight?            You're not supposed to cite that when you go to the Sixth Circuit court or you go to the state court?            Can you tell us -- let's assume for a minute that this case were on direct review, that we don't have AEDPA.       What is the standard that should control?    Whether there is an impermissible -- an unacceptable risk that impermissible factors will be taken into account by the jury?               Is that the test?          Well, but you should make it more specific for us.       You say general due process.          How does that work in this case?             I want to know whether or not I can order or must order someone to remove a sign, a button, a piece of clothing.             What's the test that I use?          That -- unless you want to go on, that doesn't help me.           We just tell all the judges in the country to assess all the circumstances, we say no more?             What about banners?       What would you do with banners?             What would you do with banners? Would it make sense to say all banners are banned from the courtroom?    I thought you would think that would make a lot of sense.             Yes.       Signs, placards.             I think I know why.       Because it affects the atmospherics of the trial.          I'm not so sure.         You think that we could just say we're going to exercise our best judgment, not necessarily amend the Constitution, just because it is a good idea, banners and buttons are hereby banned forever?    Do we have the authority to just say that?          We're exploring initially what the rule ought to be.          Falls within the ambit of what? Of a mob-dominated atmosphere or -- your answer to Justice Souter was AEDPA would -- was that this would require reversal even under AEDPA; is that your answer?
05-83 +++$+++             On -- on that point, I have -- I have one question.               At page 3a of the petition appendix, the Washington Supreme Court's opinion is set forth, and in the course of that opinion, it says, to the contrary, when defense counsel argued the definition should have been submitted to the jury, the prosecutor explicitly stated that the method under which the State is alleging and the jury found assault was committed was by the use of a deadly weapon.                     And then he goes on to say, in the crime charged in the enhancement, the State alleged there is no element of a firearm.         The element is assault with a deadly weapon. I don't -- this was at the sentencing proceeding, I take it?            Yes, because I couldn't find it in the sentencing proceeding.        It does sound as if he thinks there was -- the prosecutor thought there was no error.       A deadly weapon is a deadly weapon, and then --           Well, would it be either proper or required by the Washington trial court to tell the jury, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the charge is assault?           There is also the possibility of a sentence enhancement.             It's a 1-year enhancement if it's a deadly weapon.             It's a 3-year enhancement if it's a firearm and a pistol is a firearm.                       Would the judge err if he did that?               Or another way of putting the same question, would it be proper for the judge to leave out the 1-year deadly weapon instruction and just instruct you can -- you must determine whether it's an assault and you must determine whether there's a 3-year enhancement for the use of a firearm?           No, no.         My hypothetical is he says it's a 3-year enhancement if the deadly weapon is a firearm.            That's -- what I'm asking is, in effect, under Washington law, is it error if the judge allows the definition of deadly weapon also to go to the jury so it can find a lesser included offense.        Well, then you're saying the instruction here was proper.           Do you agree in this case that the court did have the obligation to submit a special verdict form indicating that the defendant -- asking whether the defendant was armed with a deadly weapon?           No.    As a matter -- a constitutional matter.        Suppose the -- suppose the judge didn't ask about deadly weapon at all, just -- just asked whether there's an assault.        But you -- so -- so there had to be an instruction that there was an assault in the second degree?        Well, suppose under Justice Scalia's hypothetical, aggravated murder is -- is in the charging documents, but the judge doesn't say aggravated murder when he submits it to the jury.
05-848 +++$+++               But could Duke have had a challenge to the 1992 or 2000 regulations?           Could they have reopened the issue at that point?              I don't want to jump ahead to the jurisdictional argument if you want to talk about the modification substantive point first, but it is not clear to me whether Duke should have acted in 1980, 1992 or 2000, or all of the above.                 Well, what exactly are you seeking in these enforcement proceedings?              An injunction to install the BACT or criminal fines or civil fine, or what?                 If you have an enforcement proceeding and there is a legitimate question of whether or not the agency's interpretation is consistent with the statute with Chevron deference and so forth and the court looks at it and says, you know, I have a real problem with the way the agency interpreted the basic statute when it first issued the regulation, the court can't get into that merely because the parties didn't present it earlier?                 The court's almost issuing an advisory opinion in a way.              Are there other areas in the law where courts have to take as binding a legal proposition that they think is dead wrong when they --
05-85 +++$+++               Then can you --              Can, can you tell me, if the Petitioner does not prevail here, the case goes back to the State court.      Can the immunity argument be raised in the State court?              In other words the State court couldn't say well you know, this district court was wrong; there's really immunity under the Federal statute.   The State court can't hold that?              Because then you'd have constant -- eternal shuttling back and forth, that's why.              In other words, the -- the Federal determination bars the State court from redetermining that there's immunity?                     That the State court can't say, "Federal court, you're wrong?"
05-8794 +++$+++            Well, do you have confidence --           -- do you have confidence that Florida can do that?           Well, one -- one of the circumstances that -- that was raised by the questioning is this.            States generally have the defense of laches.          They -- they require the petition to be filed within a reasonable time.                  With changes in pharmacology, the laches defense will not usually be available.          And under the proposal that the -- the State resolves it once and for all, I suppose the State couldn't adopt a new protocol that it thought was better, more humane, without risking more litigation. So it -- it really is a disincentive for the States to try to make the procedure less painful for the -- for the accused.            Precisely.      And that's going to be true with every new protocol.           You know it -- it is true that the 1983 is a civil action, and the plaintiff has the burden of proof, burden of producing evidence.            Well, it seems to me that you might -- you might have alleged that -- that you've read articles, Lancet articles, and so forth, and that there is a substantial risk that they're going to do this.       I think that might suffice.            And -- and it would -- it would mean that the -- as the Chief Justice indicates, the court has more time to look at this.
05-8820 +++$+++              I suppose you'd have to file a protective petition with the district court saying we won but we might still lose.
05-908 +++$+++                  Do you disagree in general with the Solicitor General's brief?                       Do you agree in general with the brief submitted by the Government or do you have differences with it in its approach?                Well, I can --                Well, it, it is a point that I, I'd like both him and you to discuss at some point during your argument.               If -- can you use race for site selection?     When you have, you need to build a new school.   There are three sites.               One of them would be all one race.     Site two would be all the other race. Site three would be a diversity of races.                      Can the school board with, with the intent to have diversity pick site number 3?                 It -- there's -- well, we can have all kinds of different hypotheticals, but there's residential housing segregation, and it wants, it wants, the board wants to have diversity.                 No.      It is a new school. It's a new school.                 So it'd have to take the three sites, all of them in the hypothetical, all of them equal, and just flip a coin, because otherwise it would be using a --               Well, it may not be necessary for you but it might be necessary for us when we write the case.      We're not writing just on a very fact-specific issue.        Of course, the follow-up question, and the Solicitor General can address it too, is this: Assuming some race-conscious measures are permissible to have diversity, isn't it odd to say you can't use race as a means?    I mean, that's the next question.                  That may, in fact, be why you give the -- seem to give the answer that you do.       You just don't want to embrace that contradiction.                 That is true.              Well, what would you do with strategic site selection in order to create racial diversity?              I mean, that's expressed and principal purpose.        You know the hypothetical.              Are you suggesting there was no consideration of overall educational benefits in this plan?              At page 7 of your brief you say:   "School districts have an unquestioned interest in reducing minority isolation."                     If I put a period in there, then I would get to my strategic site selection, and I still haven't got your answer on that. You don't put a period there.             You say:          ". .have an unquestioned interest in reducing minority isolation through race-neutral means."            And this brings up this same question Justice Ginsburg had.                     Isn't it odd jurisprudence where we have an objective that we state in one set of terms but a means for achieving it in another set of terms, unless your answer is that individual classification by race is, is impermissible, but other, more broad measures based on, with a racial purpose are all right?              And what is the answer to my strategic site selection hypothetical?
05-9222 +++$+++               So you think there can always be two petitions, one -- of sentences on review?              Bit is that also your theory?              But are you -- are you asking us to say that while the sentence is still under review, there can be no habeas petition filing?              Why isn't that up to the option of the petitioner?        He can take his chances or he can wait.                I'm asking if it is your position whether or not he properly can do that?              I suppose that doesn't make the dissenters in Blakely feel very good.              Of course you have to show that the result was dictated by the prior precedent. That's a strong phrase.     We said it in Stringer -- Stringer versus Black.    But if it has a new application, that's -- that's new.     Even though the principle is the same.
05-9264 +++$+++                  You mean no facts in the indictment or charging documents?                 But there is in the presentence report?
05-983 +++$+++               If we say that the parents are the real party in interest and are entitled to sue in their own right, is that the end of the case, or do we reach the second -- a second question as to whether or not they can represent the children?             Was their an argument at any point in this case that the claim was frivolous?                I'm not following you. Where is this provision?          1401 what?
05-996 +++$+++                 Could the district court -- pardon me.     Could the bankruptcy court make that same determination in deciding whether or not to allow the Chapter 7 proceeding to be converted?                He could make this inquiry in a Chapter 7 proceeding?                  He says:   I don't think you should be able to convert because there's a fraud, but I'll look at how the creditors come out.     Could he do that?           And then you don't have the specter that Justice Souter referred to of this transfer back and then the transfer back, which is a waste of time.
05-998 +++$+++              I'm not quite sure if this works, but at the trial before a petit jury there's an opportunity for counsel to object.                There isn't an opportunity to object when the grand jury indictment comes down.     Now, I guess you could move to quash.              I have the same problem. It's such a difficult requirement to get a hold of.              I mean, he drives the car, he walks, he breathes.            I mean, all of these things enable him to get into the country. I just don't understand the basis for the rule.              He wasn't forced to go over.   He did it on his own.           It seems to me that's --              What would that be here? That he drove the car to the border?               That he got out of the car?   That he presented a document?              What -- if you could do it over again, what would the indictment say?             So it's just a metaphysical inquiry, when is an indictment not an indictment?    It's not some other standard of what's fundamentally unfair or, from the Sixth amendment, whether or not there's notice?               You say poetic, I said metaphysical.   When is an indictment not an indictment?              I'm still not sure of your test.   It's whether or not it's fundamentally unfair, whether or not there's notice, which sounds like more Sixth Amendment than Fifth.         Or whether it's not an indictment, a rose is a rose type of thing.             If you concede there was an error, is there anything to prevent us from saying we don't accept that concession, and have you rebrief and argue the question of whether or not an overt act is required?              But can we do that in the face of your concession without having reargument?
06-1005 +++$+++               Can you tell me what happens if there's a -- two bank robbers, the one's with the get-away car; the other one going into the bank teller, and the robber that goes into the bank gets $1,000 and comes out and gives 500 to the get-away guy. Is that a violation of the statute?              And -- if your definition of proceeds is problematic, it is something like an abstract question you're asking us to answer.                  If this -- if we say well, we're not sure this is proceeds but if it is proceeds, it is defined as gross receipts. That's an artificial context in which to address the issue.              Well, you see the problem we have is we're not sure that it is within the statute. So then you're asking us to say how to make the statute work when we don't think the statute's applicable at all.
06-10119 +++$+++ 
06-102 +++$+++               Just on the second point. I wanted -- does the rule of the Federal district court in forum non conveniens where it dismisses a case for lack of a convenient form, does it have any ongoing consequences as the law of the case?               I know our Chick Kam Choo precedent where we said Federal court determination forum non conveniens is not binding in a state court, but supposing in this case that the parties went to San Francisco with a -- and said we want to sue there.   Would the San Francisco court, the United States District Court feel bound by the determination that this dispute is determined by Chinese law, and that the Chinese court is therefore the appropriate court?              What about the ruling that this would be governed by Chinese law and that the Chinese court is the best forum to consider that?               That too has no lat -- has no effect beyond the court in Philadelphia?                In Martin, in the hypothetical where this case is dismissed for forum non conveniens and then they go to another Federal district court, could the second Federal district court say this has already been heard by the first district court; I'm not getting into it?       Or, or does that district court have, have to go through the motion again?
06-1037 +++$+++               This has been very helpful, but it does seem to me to raise a question about the fairness of your opening statement.                 You began by saying something to the effect that this does not discriminate on the basis of age.                It does.   Age is the explicit factor that the statute uses in order to answer Justice Breyer's question.          And the Act does not prohibit the use of age in all circumstances to which it applies, but it does -- the Act goes on to prohibit the use of age in some of the circumstances.                And one of those circumstances is the hypothetical of the 55-plus-year-old person used in Justice Breyer's statement and example. So, it is not correct, it seems to me, for you to say that this does not discriminate on the basis of age.   Now, maybe there is some good reasons for doing that, you can get into that, but it seems to me it does make an explicit determination based on age as to some people.               Suppose I can't make that assumption or adopt that premise.                Is there another basis on which to reach the result?                     I think this does explicitly discriminate based on age as to some people, and you're telling me you don't want me to do that.                     But Suppose I don't agree with you.              Is there some other way to reach the result?
06-1082 +++$+++                 If we rule for Respondent in this case, would we have to reexamine the holding in California v. Greenwood?                I should know this, but do we defer to State law in determining the lawfulness of the time before arraignment in the context of confessions, the MCNabb-Mallory rule?                Which is Federal.                Well, was there any indication in that case that if the State had a shorter period, they would --
06-11206 +++$+++              But suppose it were shown -- this is hypothetical.          Suppose it were shown that 90 percent of all escapes under the escape statute were breakouts involving weapons; 10 percent were failure to report.   Would that affect how we decide the case?             Yes.             Do we look to the crime to see generally whether or not it involves violence and serious risk of harm?             So that, in my hypothetical, it would be a more difficult case than the case we have here or would it be the same?             No.      My hypothetical is, under the statute, if you look at the whole universe of prosecutions under the escape statute, 90 percent of them are for breakouts involving weapons.               But that's what we looked to in Begay.             Well, it might not, if it just said "escape," and then you'd have this same problem.
06-11429 +++$+++              Is it time-honored since Granderson?    Is that the first time we did it?             As to sentences?      As to sentences?             -- better example.         It doesn't quite work because it does not supersede the term "debtor" that was used earlier.                     In the government's submission at least in this case, "felony drug offense" supersedes the earlier provision in section 13.              So it seems to me they're not comparable in that sense.              Can you tell me what happened in South Carolina?            Could he on those facts and under the charges have been sentenced to more than a year?   It was just that the judge gave him less than a year?              But he, himself, was eligible for the --               Well, but there has to be a real ambiguity.    I mean, if there is a plausible defendant-friendly interpretation, that doesn't trigger the rule of lenity, does it or doesn't it?              That was in a context where the question was whether or not the conduct was criminal at all not since.              If you apply clear statement rule to the sentencing code, I don't think we are going to be able to get beyond the second sentence.
06-11543 +++$+++              Would you have the same answer if you had a State statute which defined felony drunk driving, as many do, as felony drunk driving which causes serious death or serious physical injury to another?               You would still say that that statute does not qualify?               No, there isn't in the usual felony drunk driving statute, there is --             Well, the driver intentionally drives the car knowing that there's a risk.             But that -- that is because everybody knows there are -- there are two conditions:    One in which he just is reckless and he doesn't care, in which case he has the intent; the other one, he's so drunk he can't form the intent.              Both of them are covered, and the latter is simply because we don't want an excuse to exonerate the more culpable of the two.             That's true in almost every State, for the reasons that I've indicated, because many people have the intent, and those that don't shouldn't be exonerated because they're more drunk.               Well, it seems to me that your argument gives us greater reason to treat the last clause as independent just so that we can be sure that it doesn't include only property crimes, because, as the Chief Justice just pointed out, "physical injury" is really the term that does the work in the second clause. So it seems to me that you're almost giving us a reason to make that clause more independent, more forceful, more significant.              Filling out a false income tax return.    I mean, I thought of one.              Well, there is a whole category of those.      So --
06-116 +++$+++                Are you suggesting that the test is whether under colorable jurisdiction -- a hypothetical case, suppose the statute, Federal statute is very clear that it applies in any case.             Would your argument be the same?              But if we accept that in the opinion, what was the phrase you used, colorable jurisdiction, or -- it's something I made up, I suppose -- is there some concept that we can refer to or some phrase that works to -- in order to incorporate your test that you seem to be suggesting?              Mr. Waxman, may I just ask this question?   I don't understand what the import of this order on page 51 is.           I have it in front of me. What did that do?    Is it anything different immediately after the order entered than --              Well, am I wrong?    I thought that the Attorney General of Guam did file cert in some cases that are pending, or am I wrong on that?             Mr. Waxman, can I ask you this, just about Guam, not about the other territories. Is there anything in the Organic Act that would prevent Guam from changing the assessed percentage from 35 percent to 100 or 150?             So there's no, no limit in the Organic Act of any real meaning?              And they're valuing it for tax purposes, so that sounds like tax valuation.
06-11612 +++$+++                 Well, I see what you're doing.   You're constructing your argument so that we have structural protections.              I can understand that argument, but Justice Souter's question points out just as a practical matter this is not nearly as important as a failure to object to illegally seized evidence, a post -- a post-arrest delay, open courtroom, all of which are subject to waiver.                Well, I was interested in your comment on trying cases, but to say that you have to sit down and explain to the -- to the defendant the difference between the magistrate and an Article III and why you like this particular magistrate -- it's the attorney that does all the questioning, after all --                    it seems to me is -- is a burden.             It's not justified by the position that you're -- you're submitting to us.             That gets back to your structural argument, which makes a certain amount of sense just insofar as knowing where the line is. On the other hand, I'm just not sure of the practical significance of the client's participation when it's really the attorney who is making the decision whether or not this magistrate will allow him to strut his stuff in front of the jury for a little longer than the district judge would.           I just don't see how the client can really have much informed input into that at all.
06-1164 +++$+++                  Was the rule or the presumption that you just quoted in effect when Congress last revised the statute?                 But you can -- was Congress aware of that general rule when it last revised the statute?                 I don't, either, and that's why, when you say, well, it's a general rule, well, your argument tends to lose force because of the fact that Congress acts against the background of what this Court has stated.              Well, that -- that assumes that the government has waived in every case.                  If it hasn't waived, I have to do it anyway.             If they, if they raise the defense --             -- then you're going to have to determine it anyway, subject to clearly erroneous findings of fact, as to when the person entered the property and so forth.
06-1181 +++$+++                If you say that tolling is automatic, which I assume is your position, would it be possible under the statutes to say that tolling is not automatic but can be permitted in the discretion of the hearing officer?               Or are we then just inventing something that's not in the statute at all?               No.      All it needs to do is to say, we'll grant you an extension while we look at this.              If your client or some other client, assuming the government wins in this case, leaves within the 60-day period and the petition for rehearing is forwarded, can he take all these affidavits and apply for an adjustment of status, or is that much longer?              Even with voluntary departure?
06-1195 +++$+++              Suppose there had not been a six-year wait, would it be appropriate then for us to -- if you prevail -- remand the case to the habeas court and instruct the habeas court to defer until the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has finished the DTA review proceedings?             Why should I assume that the district court in Washington would be any faster than the court of appeals?             Why can't that take place in the CSRT review proceedings that are pending?              You're not heartened by the prospect that the detainees could apply to the Cuban courts, which would then hand process to the Commanding General at Guantanamo? (Laughter.)             What does that tell you about the adequacy of the substitute?
06-1204 +++$+++               I just didn't hear you. You said that this dispute should be settled by --               Well, it gets way ahead of the analysis and probably way ahead of your argument. At some point I'd like you to address whether or not one of the equities the Court can consider is the likelihood of an earlier decision.         Let's assume we project out another 10 years.    Does that make a difference?                    That may come toward the end of your argument rather than now, but I'd like it addressed at some point.               Could you address that? That is the issue.      Sovereign immunity, is this a question of where a party is just entitled to plead inconsistent theories?         Was this a special appearance? Why is it that the Philippines can come into court and say, "we have sovereign immunity, and therefore the suit must be dismissed"?       Would you just address that basic point?              But suppose a case -- and you have to do a lot of supposing.                Suppose that the Philippine Government was simply not amenable to the process of the court, not because of foreign immunity, but just because it was outside the geographic area where process ran.      It just can't be made a party. Exactly the same analysis as here?                 I understand, but in my hypothetical case it's just as if somebody is at the North Pole and you can't serve them.
06-1221 +++$+++                If you were to read the district court's minute order -- and this is that short minute order -- as saying that evidence of pattern and practice simply is not admissible, that would be error, would it not?    Error to -- if the -- if that had been his ruling, that would have been error.                 In my Court, you don't introduce pattern and practice.                 That can't be --               Is there anything in the other parts of the record colloquy, comments by the district judge, that you think Respondents have called to our attention to indicate that he had this sweeping view?               Excuse me.           Did I hear mishear you?   You said it's a 7,000-person?              It doesn't mention the offer of proof.                 Was there an attempt by the plaintiff during the discovery phase of the case to show other evidence of pattern and practice, statistical evidence; or was it just these five people?                      Was that all that the plaintiff presented?              The inference they are trying to prove is there was somebody upstairs that told everybody what to do.              Does the record show in this 70,000-person company how many supervisors there were?   Do we know that?                 The next step up would be --             I see your -- does 404 bear on the case, Rule 404 of the Rules of Evidence?             Even if those supervisors RIF'd two thousands employees, and only three made this complaint?             No matter how many employees were RIF'd, only three supervisors -- hypothetical case, three supervisors.                   No many how many employees were RIF'd, the three is sufficient so that these witnesses could testify?             So take it in this case, and in all cases, the plaintiff has the burden of laying the foundation for this evidence; is that not correct?             And you say the foundation is satisfied if they were the same supervisors in the same division, I thought.             You want us to write that in a case as a rule?             Without reference to how many employees were involved?               You said there were two points about 403.
06-1249 +++$+++               Just at the outset, I'll just make one comment.        You argue that it's impossible for Wyeth to comply with the State law and at the same time the Federal label.         As a textual matter, as a logical matter, I just -- I don't understand that.                 I think I could design a label that's completely consistent and that meets the requirements that the Respondents wish to urge. Now, if you want to say that any alteration of the label violates Federal law, that's something else.   But as a textual matter, as a logical matter, as a semantic matter, I don't agree with it.             The FDA was never concerned with risks versus benefit?                I don't understand what we're talking about here.            The new information was not brought up by either side --               -- showing increased frequency or increased severity?               Right? And supposedly, it was burden of the drug company to show --               You agree with -- you agree with Mr. Waxman that the FDA specifically addressed the risks and benefits of IV push as opposed to the risks of arterial exposures?             You're talking about changing but you can supplement without changing the label.
06-1286 +++$+++              I think those three points are certainly what would help me.                Could I ask just two preliminary questions?       They don't necessarily have to do with this case, just to get something straight.                     I take it that you couldn't have claimed this deduction under 162 without getting into an argument that it should be capitalized and that's why 212 is in the Code?             My other question is background only.   Perhaps I should ask the government. Are 162 expenses subject to the 2 percent ceiling?                 Well, it seems to me that that just simply couldn't have been Congress's purpose in passing this statute because now you have a recipe for avoidance.     In most States -- California has a rule that the trustee has to make prudent business investments.     I assume a great number of businessmen outside the trust context think that they have their principal objective of making prudent business investments.     But under your theory all expenses for that objective would fall within this exclusion.                       I just don't think that's what the Congress could possibly have intended.             Well, is that true just in your case?             Universally, there is never a danger of tax avoidance?                You want us to write the decision on the assumption that tax avoidance is never a problem in the creation of a trust?               What do you have to support that?   I resist accepting that broad proposition, and I don't know where to look or who to ask in order to determine its -- its truth or falsity.
06-1287 +++$+++               I was going to ask this question.   Is it -- would it be permitted for a State to say that, with respect to utilities and certain industries, including railroads, we use valuation Method A, with respect to commercial rental real estate property we use valuation Method B?                     Is that permitted?              So is a large part of the argument you would make that other utilities are comparable or not comparable to a railroad?               Suppose an accounting journal or some prestigious group of accountants and tax appraisers came up with a new theory for evaluating railroad property and it was conceded by all to be highly accurate.   Could they use just that for the railroad and different methodologies for all other utilities all over the country?               So that if had the Platonic, the ideal valuation method, the State could use it only if it ended up with the right ratio?               But in the end it has to have the right ratio.              Well, Congress uses the word "true market value" and under this hypothetical I come very close to true market value, and you say it doesn't work.              I thought your -- I thought your submission was that even if is true market value for the railroad, the ratio still has to be in line if the methodology is different.
06-1321 +++$+++  
06-1322 +++$+++ 
06-134 +++$+++               Well, on that point in some jurisdictions and perhaps you can tell me about New York, I had thought and correct me if I'm wrong, that tax liens have a superior status to other liens in that they are an, an interest or an estate in the property as opposed to an attachment. Is it not true?             And I don't, and I'm not talking just about order of priority for creditors.                     I'm talking about the superiority insofar as being or not being an interest in property.              Yes.              Is there New York law to that effect?             Because I had -- I had thought that it is an estate in land in at least some jurisdictions.    And Justice Breyer was asking about the same thing.    In other words, there are liens -- there are liens and liens.       There are different kinds of liens.               Why isn't it commercial activity for New York to say, we provide garbage services, electric services, et cetera.              But they pay fees and New York taxes.     Suppose New York doesn't have fees. Suppose they say, we'll just do this out of our property tax.              Well, what about the argument that it was an interest in property.                     The brief was very clear that it is an interest in property, and that a tax lien is almost sui generis, in that it is an estate in the property.              It survives bona fide -- it survives bona fide purchaser without notice?              Do you take the position that it's improper even to notice the property with the lien?              I mean, let's assume that you owe the taxes.
06-1413 +++$+++                  No.              I have the same --                 I think this is part of the substance.   I thought that as part of one of your answers you said that Ohio is free to allocate part of this capital gains tax to Illinois?                       Did I hear you say that, because I don't understand that?              I see.             Are you saying this is a passive investment?               I don't like to intrude on the white light, but if I could just ask one question. If the unitary-tax argument has been preserved and is met and if there's a finding that they are unitary, does Illinois have the right to tax the sale, or to -- to a portion of it?               No, no.         Assume -- assume it is unitary.   Can Illinois then, in your view, have a part of -- tax part of the gain on the sale?
06-1431 +++$+++               Do you mean Patterson would come out the same under 1981 as amended by the 1991 act.              I think Congress would have been quite amazed at that rule.              And Congress changed that and the case we have is also post-formation.              Under your view, would harassment be prohibited by 1981 as amended?              But the term "harassment" is not included in 1981(b).              You practice in this --              -- in this area --              Perhaps you can maybe just tell me based on your experience:               After 1981 was amended, did 1981(b) supersede Title VII in run-of-the-mill termination and harassment cases?              No, no, not retaliation. I mean harassment, discharge, et cetera.              Yes.              Why not?        There's a longer statute of limitation.      There's no cap on damages.              Well, then I have to refine the hypothetical.        I don't want to take too much, but in Federal court --              -- because it does seem to me that Congress told us:         We don't care if there's an overlap between 1981 and Title VII, we don't care if there's a longer statute of limitations, we don't care if there's no cap an damages; we want 1981 to work.                And that's -- 1981 does apply in a large number of employment discrimination cases.             And if that's true, then why do we worry about retaliation?                 If Congress is not concerned about it, why should we be?
06-1456 +++$+++               If we take it that you concede -- I don't want to say that you concede.             If we take it the government has a strong case under the smuggling statute, wouldn't it have an equally strong case under (i) of the statute that we're considering here, which doesn't require concealing or disguising the nature, just to avoid a transportation reporting requirement.    That's the same as the smuggling statute.                I know the government didn't indict under (ii).                You mean as the proceeds of an illegal transaction?                Was there a reporting requirement for -- for this shipment.                    If he had gone to the border, would he -- well, then, a lot of what you're arguing about isn't very important because they could just indict under (ii).                To avoid a transaction-reporting requirement, and you wouldn't have to go through all this "nature" thing.                You indicated that there is such a requirement.             Oh, I see.              Suppose the evidence is clear that he knew he was taking it across the border and it was to pay the drug dealer?                  Would that suffice?              Well, but -- no, no.       He conceals it, in order to pay the drug dealer.              Yes.              It's concealing who owns and controls.
06-1457 +++$+++               Just so I understand your answer to Justice Alito's question, the Commission has retroactive authority to alter the permission to engage in these contracts only if there is fraud --              -- or something similar?              Retroactive?              Retroactively?              But Justice Alito's question, I think as I understood it, or at least a question in my mind that followed upon it, was whether or not -- what's the basis for any retroactive revocation of that or --               Is volatile the same as dysfunctional?
06-1463 +++$+++                  I couldn't find the order that the court -- in the record it says that the order would be -- the court granted a preliminary injunction, the superior court, and then it said, according to an order to be entered by the clerk.                  How long was the arbitration stayed for?          There was an enjoined -- there was an injunction.      What was the term of the injunction? Just until further order of the court?                 Did the Respondent at any point indicate that after the Labor Commission, Labor Commissioner, made a determination that they would not go to superior court for de novo review?              I must say that the Volt case is written in rather sweeping language that's not particularly helpful to you.            On its facts, I think it's different because there were other parties, independent parties in the litigation.          Don't you think that's the best way to distinguish Volt in your case?              Does the Labor Commissioner have authority to commence proceedings on his own motion or her own motion?                Well, I'm sorry that I asked already.                If you go to the superior court for de novo review, can you ask the superior court for an order enforcing its decision?                Well, you get de novo review.   So do you ask the court for an order -- a declaratory order, declaring that the person is a talent agent or is not a talent agent?             So do you think it would be within the authority of the superior court to say this is a judgment binding on the parties and the arbitration will not proceed, or must proceed consistently with my order?             Yes.       Well, but if the Respondent prevails, don't you think that the superior court has that authority?             If Respondent prevails in this case, don't you think that the superior court can then say that its declaration is final and the arbitration shall not proceed?              But that's always the case.   It's always the case that the arbitration is quiet on this.     It is -- the Respondent's position is that it is absolutely quiet, but it is also absolutely clear that it is State law.             I'm not sure that Volt would have been different.          Volt is -- Volt is written very broadly, it seems to me, in favor of the Respondent's position.                I suppose if we write the case your way, we have to talk about what happens if this Labor Commissioner had enforcement powers, that they had the sua sponte right to invoke, and that they did?
06-1498 +++$+++               You're arguing an unconstitutional condition, in effect.               Leaving aside Buckman, what's your strongest case in support of your position? Besides that it is a new problem.             This -- this tracks somewhat Justice Stevens' question.                     Do we know in this case, would this have taken two or three days of testimony?   Was there discovery?              Was it a thousand documents?   Or three documents?               There was special consideration because of military considerations.
06-1505 +++$+++              Is there a hypothetical universe where a scheme that discriminates on the basis of age is reasonable, but there is another alternative that doesn't discriminate on the basis of age?                 Is the first alternative still reasonable, or does the existence of a nondiscriminating alternative make it unreasonable?             If that's true, then is it necessary either on the burden of production or burden of persuasion aspect of the case to consider other alternatives?             Why is it necessary in light of the answer you gave me at the outset?             Whether you even get to --              The burden of production, of course.             And what about the burden of persuasion?             Why is it that if the employer has the burden of production, and I assume that is satisfied by his saying, here's the plan that we used, here are the factors we used, here is the reason we used them.    What is so difficult for the -- what is the difficulty in saying that the employee then has to show that that is unreasonable?              You think the statute doesn't make sense, so we don't --             Well, I'm well aware of the statutory format here.            But what I want to ask is why is it beyond the employee's means and capacity to show that this is unreasonable?                It seems to me that that's the gravamen of this case.               Well, if I find the text of the statute neutral or at least not clear, then it is proper for me to ask as a matter of efficiency where the burden should be placed, is it not?              I'm not sure that if the statute contains three different conditions, three different commands, that it follows that the procedural implementations for all of these has to be the same. Do you have any authority for that proposition?              If you want to say that Congress was well aware of burden of persuasion, burden of production problems with affirmative action, then they wouldn't have drafted it this way, that's one thing.    I'm not sure that that's true.              Yes, and just adding on to the Chief Justice, it seems the employer is the one that would prove the negative.          He has to say there were no -- here is a whole universe of other frameworks, and none of these work.
06-1509 +++$+++                I also wanted to know whether there is in the record the corporation's balance sheet?   It was frankly hard for me to believe that this was not in excess of basis.             You don't usually capitalize corporations for $10 million.                   But I don't have any basis other than just an assumption to make that observation.    Is the corporate balance sheet with the capital structure in the record?               Was it introduced by the Government or by the defendant?              I'm not, I'm not sure if what the Government is maintaining here is so prejudicial to its position in other cases, which was the earlier discussion we were having.                  Here there is simply nothing on the corporate records to show that this was a distribution with respect to stock.                  I don't care whether this is earnings and profits or in excess of basis.   But there's just no indication of the distribution with respect to stock, and you have two shareholders.   Under Hawaiian law, can you make a disproportionate distribution to shareholders so one person gets capital back and the other doesn't and there's no redemption of shares?              That was, that was the qualification that the Second Circuit made in its D'Agostino case.   It said if there's a violation of corporate law then our rule doesn't apply.              Well, but that's the whole point.   The fact that he doesn't show this as a distribution indicates that he couldn't do this under Federal law, so it must be something -- under State law, so it must be something other than a distribution.              Well, under the Government's intent test, I suppose if you have a calendar year and the distribution is made in June, that the Government could say:          What we want to show -- we want you to show that there was an intent to make a distribution with respect to stock at that time. Whether or not it was a dividend, whether or not it was a return of capital, we won't know until the end of the year.   I suppose they could try to argue that.              You mean to say the Government can't argue that this -- the Defendant has to show that it was a distribution with respect to stock and that that was his intent.             Whether or not it was a dividend, whether or not it was a return of capital, we wait.              Well, at 97, are you saying that the expert would have brought with him financial records to show earnings and profits and basis?    Because I interpret the Government as saying there was nothing for him to testify to because there was no other -- the basic value was not in the record.
06-157 +++$+++              I had the same question as Justice Ginsburg, and I think was also suggested by Justice Scalia's question.           Suppose that Congress passed a statute that said we hereby appropriate a million dollars to the President to use to call religious conferences, and then it spelled out these conferences. Is there standing there?             But --and I of course want the answer, but then, why is that consistent with what you told us at the beginning that there had to be a statute?                -- just one, one more question on this, on this line.                And I won't belabor the hypothetical.   Again there's a Federal statute for this conference, and the moneys go for air tickets to various religious ministers and priests.                 Does that meet your outside the Government test for standing?
06-1595 +++$+++              I was going to say in part it seems to me that in isolation it seems harmless, almost trivial, but the whole point is that the employer doesn't think it is trivial.             The employer uses it, by hypothesis, as a basis to retaliate.              It seems to me that the participation clause is the line of least resistance.                   I understand we have to say what a hearing is and so forth.   Are you asking us to resolve on the opposition clause because that will give more guidance to the system or --             I think that's a very strong argument for the participation clause.             Is the only question -- -the participation is not in doubt.                      The only question is whether it's an investigation under this subtitle.
06-1646 +++$+++                Are there any statutes which talk about offender as opposed to "offense" in this area, do you know?              It seems to me your argument might be slightly better if the statutory term was "authorized," not "prescribed."                      I don't say "prescribed" could never be used in the sense you mean, but when you have alternates we usually would use the word -- alternate possibilities -- usually you'd use the word "authorize" rather than "prescribe."               "Prescribe" indicates one rule.
06-1666 +++$+++              But habeas corpus is concerned with the safety of the prisoner to the extent that it's controlled by our authorities.                And if you're in the United States, could an officer release a prisoner knowing that a lynch mob was outside?               I should think not.             Of course, this is just a hypothetical question. Right.  Right.
06-1717 +++$+++               You began -- and it's not just because of my notepad but because I'm interested -- you told Justice Ginsburg there are two reasons --              -- why the government's cap is wrong.     And I'm not even sure you finished the first one.    What are the two reasons?                 Assume that our decision will in part drive the market either way, what we do will effect the way paralegals are used, the way billing is done.     If that is true, is there some utility in simply following the EAJA so we give a consistent signal to the market and then if Congress wants to change it, it can?     I mean --                 Rather than follow EAJA, I mean follow 1988, follow Jenkins.                  Follow Jenkins.              Are there some disutilities from an economic standpoint in having two structures:    Jenkins for one kind of cases, EAJA in the other cases as the government wants?              Are there some disadvantages to the system?
06-179 +++$+++                Well, before that decision is reached, let me ask you this -- under State law, either generally or specifically under the law of the State that you are trying to invoke here, does the jury -- does the finder of fact weigh the potential risks of injury and illness against the probable benefits to the health of the patient?          Is that one of the things the jury does?    In other words, suppose this was a very important device, but it had a one percent risk.                 Does the jury consider that when it determines whether that's been negligently sold?               Alright, now isn't that exactly what the FDA measured in the PMA process?                 The FDA is specifically charged with weighing the risks against the probable benefits.                 So the jury is doing the same thing that the FDA did.                 Well, but that was under the expedited 510(k).        That's different than PMA, because in PMA there's a specific weight.                Was Medtronic free to alter this label without the FDA's consent?                What's the citation for that?             What do I read in order to verify your statement that the -- that manufacturers can cure the label without FDA approval?                     Where do I find that?             Yes.
06-219 +++$+++               May I ask a quick question.   I had the same list of alleged acts, and I think many of them are uncontested, that Justice Ginsburg mentioned.     Just as a matter of policy, can you inform me, when the Solicitor General's Office takes this case do you look into whether any of these things happen and the Justice Department issues a warning, don't do this any more?        If these things are as Justice Ginsburg explained you don't defend all of those actions?              I know that.    I know that.                  Because if this, if this continues, your argument -- and I understand your argument that there's no essential free-standing cause of action for damages -- basically means he has a right to go broke with attorneys' fees challenging each individual incursion, each individual wrong. Well, again that assumes that he wouldn't get any relief out of the IBLA.                That assumes that if he had gone to the IBLA and said, you canceled my grazing permits for grounds that weren't valid, that the BLM would have proceeded to engage in the same conduct.                  In fact, the IBLA --             Piecemeal.             Piecemeal.             Does he have any action that is other than piecemeal?             I take it the answer is no.                 As originally negotiated, with I think Nelson.        Was the right-of-way cancellable at any time?   Or how long would the right-of-way last?               Can I ask you about the Bivens theory here before your time runs out?                 Doesn't Davis versus Passman help the Respondent here?               Well that's because we assume it's focused just on his property and that the property was ultimately the thing that was in issue. But if you have all these other retaliatory actions, and wrongful actions taken by the Government tangential to this dispute, I take it Davis versus Passman, broadly read, says we can use Bivens if there is no other way to get a remedy against the Government.              Suppose we think -- suppose we disagree with you on the latter point.               We think he is really in a bind; there's not really anything he can do.     Doesn't that invoke the Davis versus Passman rationale?              To expand -- it would be an expansion of Bivens.              The people who had done this --              Davis versus Passman is a different context.      But in theory is it consistent with what the Respondent asks?
06-278 +++$+++                Well, is this case limited to signs about drugs?        What is the rule that you want us to adopt for deciding this case?               Disruptive of what? Disruptive of the classroom order?                There was no classroom here.              Well, suppose you have -- suppose you have a mission to have a global school.                       Can they ban American flags on lapel pins?                Yes, but the rule you proposed, I thought, in response to my question is that the school has wide discretion to define its educational mission and it can restrict speech that's inconsistent with that mission.                And it seems to me that's much broader than Tinker.            Now you said, well, there is an exception for political speech.                   Well, but then you're right with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, let's suppose that they have a particular view on a political issue, No Child Left Behind, or foreign intervention and so forth.              And is that the rationale on which you wish us to decide this case, nothing more broad?              I'm asking what your recommendation is to what our rule should be this case.             Well, then you're not arguing for the broad educational mission, which is what you said at the first.               This, this -- this parade had a theme to celebrate the Olympics, with -- the high school kids are carrying the torch, the band is in it. And suppose the banner said vote for, vote Republican, vote Democrat.   And he wants to be on the TV with that. Could this, the principal make him take that sign out of the ground in that it's inconsistent with the whole theme of, of, of the parade?            Something like our Kurle case?                Is that different from the rationale you've put.
06-313 +++$+++                  Well, just on your assumption, to make your hypothetical clear, you, you want us to assume that three or four times at least he violated a constitutional standard?                 I just want to know what arguendo assumption you are making.               I mean, they'd be improper because they -- they were based on an emotional appeal that's improper?              That passage was in the context of other statements in which I think it's fair to say that he analogized the role of the juror to the role of a soldier who has to have the courage and the duty to kill.                Could you tell us -- as you know, AEDPA has the decisions of settled precedents of the Supreme Court and there's the Supreme Court standard, a very general standard that we can get from Darden and Donnelly, although we didn't reverse there. I take it that the counsel for the Respondent is going to say:              Well, this is a Federal standard, but the Eighth Circuit is entitled to apply the specificity and the application that it's given to this, so the Eighth Circuit's entitled to rely on its cases in reversing. Do you agree with that?              I assume that's what they're going to tell us.              Why.              Well, didn't he seek a COA?               This is a pro se prisoner. He gets his -- all the claims are exhausted, it's dismissed.     And he seeks a COA on that point.               Why would it be applicable to State prosecutors if it is not a rule.                       I don't understand that.     Is it applicable to a State prosecutor or not?    If a state prosecutor asked you for your advice, is this opinion applicable.                       And you tell him yes or no.               But they must follow because it's the law, right?               Well, where did Chief Justice Stone get it from?               Where did Chief Justice Stone get it from?      Just because of our supervisory power?    I mean, if it's just Federal supervisory power, then I think you could tell the counsel, he doesn't have to follow it, it's due process.
06-340 +++$+++              Do we take the case and -- I'll ask the same question to your colleagues from the other side -- on the assumption that if the nine -- the factors in the statutes are met, that EPA has no discretion to withhold the transfer?
06-376 +++$+++                  Is that the one that says interest abated with respect to erroneous refund check? Or am I reading wrong?              Is it fair to say that Congress acted on the assumption that there was no right to the abatement with, and to the payment unless it enacted the statutes?
06-413 +++$+++               Would you agree that if we grant your position and grant you relief, that it would be something of an extension over Witt and Darden, in that the jurors in Witt and Darden had fixed views, that they were as a matter of conscience opposed to the penalty?             I understand that.       But I do think that the views of this juror, Deal, were somewhat more equivocal than in the cases I've mentioned.                It seems to me on that point that the State is somewhat surprised and whipsawed.   And I understand that the Washington court reached the issue.      It is not independent State ground. I take it the prosecutor had some peremptories left?                How late in the process was -- was Deal considered?               Was he one of the early jurors or one of the late jurors?                This was about a 17 day voir dire?             Well, that cuts a little bit against the peremptory.             I mean, if it was early in the game the prosecutor might not have exercised the peremptory.             Oh, I see.        So the whole jury is -- I see.               But the point stands that the court of appeals was just incorrect in, in, in not noting what's there too late.              It's just not a fair summary of what the Washington Supreme Court did.              Well, what is -- I know, Justice Breyer; just on this point.                     The defense actually volunteered "no objection."               If there is confusion, is that grounds for excluding him?
06-427 +++$+++               So in speech terms, there were alternative means to get the message out.              I think the briefs are -- I think it's fair to characterize the Respondent's brief this way, or fair to concentrate on Pickering.                It seems to me that Pickering is the key here, and I took away that impression from your brief. If we said that it's commercial speech, I think that's a little far off the mark.                If we said it's an unconstitutional condition, I'm not sure that helps either side that much, either.              In Umbehr we said, the Court said, that in the independent contractor cases the interests of either party, the government or the contractor, are not quite so intense as they are with a public employee.   I thought that made sense when I read it.   I'm not so sure it does any more.              Well, I suppose we could construct a hypothetical where we could say there's a very strong interest in the contractor.                 So I'm not sure that that works as a general theorem.             And how would you balance it?             And how would you commence?             Could the association bar Brentwood from contacting public school students altogether?             About enrollment.      About enrollment.               Well, like if Brentwood, let's assume -- I think it's true -- is rather well-known in the State, and if they send you a solicitation form to enroll, everybody knows they've got a great athletic program, so we say you can't solicit any high school students.               I haven't kept track of your time, but if we're going to rule for you we have to reach the due process problem.               And at some point after you finish discussing what you wish to on free speech, I actually find that a somewhat more difficult issue.             It seems to me that, turning to the state action for a moment, one of the justifications for finding state action that is there is no other real choice, that they have, other than to -- if they want to play athletics in Tennessee other than to join this association. And yet at the opening of your argument, you said oh, well it's voluntary.             So It seems to me that your speech argument is inconsistent with one of the justifications for finding state action to begin with.               But that's somewhat inconsistent with one of the most forceful arguments for finding state action to begin it, i.e., that you have to join the school if you really want to compete with most of the schools.   You have to join the association.              I thought it had some State claims as pendant claims.
06-43 +++$+++        The transaction was not wholly without benefit to Scientific-Atlanta.       They got some advertising.    And it was not wholly without benefit to Charter.    They were able to show that advertising works.   Now, that puts aside the fact that they were using misleading accounting principles.       But there are -- there are any number of kickbacks and mismanagement and petty frauds that go on in the business, and business people know that any publicly held company's shares are going to be affected by its profits, so I see no limitation to your -- to your proposal for liability.       Well, I agree with Justice Scalia's earlier comment, I don't think that Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola really cared anything of -- one way or the other about the investors.       For them the scheme made a certain amount of sense, they didn't really care.       But that's far different from having a purpose.     You said they have to have a purpose.       Which goes back to my earlier question, that most people that engage in frauds on business know that if it's a publicly held corporation, it's going to hurt the price of the shares or affect the price of the shares.
06-457 +++$+++ 
06-480 +++$+++                Mr. Olson, does brand competition generally help retailers, or is this a question that can't be answered?               Interbrand, interbrand competition?   Do retailers like interbrand competition?             Well, but we're talking about inter -- we're talking about retailers.              It, it seems to me at the outset of the argument, you -- you acknowledged, and I think it is the general rule -- that if the retailers themselves have this resale price maintenance, it is invalid.            Well, if the manufacturer does this just for the convenience of the retailers, and that's -- many of the examples in your brief, it is for the convenience and for the benefit of the retailers, then why shouldn't there be a per se rule?              Why should we allow the manufacturer to do something we that wouldn't allow the retailers to do, if it's for the retailers?
06-484 +++$+++                At some point during your argument -- and I know you only have 20 minutes -- will you tell me whether or not in your view the pleading standard that the judge must follow is equivalent, is the same as the instruction that's given to the jury? Because if it isn't, then the Seventh Amendment argument may have some more force.              Well, in writing -- I take it, so far as the jury, it's just whether it's more likely than not, preponderance of the evidence.              So your submission is, maybe not in this case, but insofar as your theory of the case, that the trial judge can, and in fact must basically apply a standard of fact -- standard of proof that's higher than that what the jury would.               A burden of over 50 percent?              I just have to make it clear.   Is the high likelihood, or strong inference, is greater than more likely than not?              Can you tell me a little bit of how -- how this should work in your view?                  Assume the CEO makes misstatements as to the earnings report and the acceptance of one of its new products.                  Just assume that.              Can we make a strong inference that a CEO knows what his own earnings reports are?              Can we make a strong inference that a CEO knows the status of current earnings --              -- when he makes, when he makes a statement.               And by the proof stage you mean both summary judgment and submission to jury?               What would you think about the following --              Is the requisite standard, knowledge of falsity.              Intent to make a false statement?
06-5247 +++$+++                I suppose he could have come here on direct.              It says that if the Brecht standard applies, does the Petitioner or the State bear the burden?    I guess that's the narrower question, who has the burden.              Mr. Haltom, before you go drifting, counsel, into the evidentiary questions in the case, I have one question.           Two cases.           A, Hurtz did not testify at all.    B, he did.           Is the foundation ruling any different in the two cases insofar as Maples' testimony or is it the same?             I.e., is there a lesser showing for foundation if Hurtz did testify?               Oh, you mean, oh, you mean more?   You have to be more strict for foundation after Hurtz testified?   I was suggesting the opposite.
06-5306 +++$+++                 Yes, it was authorized by the district court in the sense the district court put it on a piece of paper.          It wasn't authorized because the district court had no authority to extend that.              Well it is an equitable rule conditioned upon compliance with time limits.              Well, I mean, that -- that may, that may be true of this stage; but Justice Scalia's question points up the problem of what do we do if we write this case?               How do we formulate this rule?   And if we say that it's not jurisdictional, not binding, then going forward, it seems to me to allow the hypothetical that he puts to you.                That's why we're wondering how to write the opinion. (Laughter.)               I looked at this.      There's a time start.     And I think it might be the time stamp when this document was entered on the ultimate appeal. But -- but something you said at the outset prompts this question, that -- Did you think that -- the time runs from $14 days after the date when the district court's order is entered.                 And was there a submission or an implication in your remarks that you thought that the order was not entered until three days later?                 Is there an entry -- is there a time entry on the dock -- on court's order?                 I know that it's a handwritten one.     But that that -- that shows how long he has to appeal.     is there a date when the order was put on the docket?      Does that show on this sheet?              And I asked this once before:     Did the document you received show the dates that it was entered on the docket, so you knew when the 14 days was running from?             But it says when it was signed by the judge.      It doesn't say when it was entered on the docket, when it was entered by the clerk.
06-531 +++$+++               But in, but in many cases the case will become moot after a period of time and the Chief Justice and I have the same concern.                The question is directed to do we just keep this litigation alive for the -- for the ancillary issue of attorney's fees?              Well, we're asking about what rule you propose we adopt and the submission to you is that if we have a rule there can never be attorneys fees in this instance, that will then create pressure to continue the litigation when it's for all practical purposes of no real importance to the parties, other than to just establish attorney's fees.                And that seems a waste of resources.              Well, you are saying the Chief Justice is proposing a rule.                   I think he was asking you -- you want to just give us all or nothing. And we're suggesting that it just doesn't make systemic good sense to insist that every preliminary injunction be carried through to a final adjudication for attorney's fees.     And we are asking is there some midway ground.    And you, you've so far -- you can structure the argument the way you want, but you so far are -- in effect telling me absolutely not.              We have when election season comes many, many requests for injunctions, and after the election is over the case just goes away. Nobody is interested.              Under your position, all of these matters must be contested until final judgment before attorney's fees are available.
06-5618 +++$+++              It seems to me that gives very little weight to the goal, which I think is a congressional goal, of nationwide consistency in eliminating the disparities in the sentencing system which cause great disrespect to the justice system.                 Can I substitute "substantial" for "gravitational" without offending your position or affecting your position?                 Kind of a weak law of gravity like the Moon.         It's only at one-seventh. (Laughter.)                 Well, I guess the question is how strong should we say or can we say, or can Congress say it is?                Then it seems to me that to accomplish the goal that you want to accomplish in this case, you almost remove the appellate courts from the process.              Well, as one of the themes that you advance, you indicate that if your approach is followed that the guidelines will then be adjusted over time. I assume they would be adjusted to be more precise, but then we are right back where we started because you want to give the guidelines very little effect.   It seems to me, in a way, you're arguing against yourself. If your view is accepted and the result is considerable disparity, I suppose all that Congress can do is have mandatory minimums.             Do you think it is idle to talk about disparity before the Sentencing Reform Act was adopted?    You remember those days.               Well, I think you ran away from Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical just a little bit. Let's assume that Congress wants to keep this distinction and let's assume that there's no constitutional problem with the distinction.             There might be, but let's assume. Can the judge simply say, I ignore that congressional -- congressional judgment is wrong.                I'm not going to do that.               Is the judge permitted --

06-571 +++$+++               But -- but what you're saying is that all Watson did was to receive the gun. But he agreed to accept the gun as payment.              It seems to me that in that sense he used a gun.          It wasn't his gun yet, but he agreed that if the gun would be brought to the scene of the transaction, that he would accept receipt of it.              He says, you get a gun, you put it in your car, you come to my house, you bring that gun with you, and I will give you drugs.                  I think in a sense he's using the gun.              It's through the, the actions of another that he is doing it to be sure.             Perhaps.        But it seems to me to unduly constrict the case to say that all he did was receive it.   He did more than that.                 He agreed in advance.               Suppose he received the gun, loaded it and said, well, now, let's renegotiate this transaction? (Laughter.)               But he doesn't brandish it.   He just, he puts it in his pocket and he says: Let's renegotiate this.         What result?             Could the government charge him?
06-5754 +++$+++                Where -- I'm looking at that.   It says shall consider.             Am I missing something?               Can you give me your page cite?             Suppose the district court says I give these following -- I've considered these following specific factors.            But in my view, the consistency and nationwide uniformity that the guidelines strive to achieve is of great importance; and for that reason, I'm following the guidelines?             Is that an inappropriate judgment for the district court to make?             It's not the end all. Suppose the district judge said I think this is of great importance.    You don't think that the Booker opinion -- or do you think the Booker opinion rejected uniformity and consistency as an important factor?             Mr. Cochran, you do contend, do you not, that if the guidelines had been mandatory, there would have been a violation of the Sixth Amendment.             That's right, Your Honor, absolutely.                 The guidelines are what?                 Can you say it is an initial benchmark?                 So benchmarks are bad. Presumption is bad.       Great weight, that's bad?
06-593 +++$+++                I thought it also addressed, unlike the more general regulation, just people who have companionship services.                So if you have a maid or a cook or a footman, who doesn't provide companionship, then 109 is inapplicable.
06-618 +++$+++               What is that citation?          I was looking for that.     Is that cited in your brief?              Thank you.             You mean we held that the statute was constitutional on its face?             I'll look at Eichman, but it's not my recollection of the case, that the whole, the essence of the duty imposed by, under the statute was held.             Well, but there's always an application or there's no case.             Absent some declaratory judgment provision.              And in we recite that the district court held the Act unconstitutional as applied to appellees and dismissed the charges.             Isn't that a -- can you give me examples of cases where that Act applies?             Can you give me instances in which employees of an the office of a Senator are covered by these obligations and cannot invoke the Speech or Debate Clause?          What's the classic example where you can't invoke the Speech or Debate Clause?             Yeah.             Yes.       Because it seems to me that your argument just completely eviscerates the intent of the Congress in passing this Act.              Well, except the Act itself has a provision for office of Senators.              And so it seems to me you're giving no effect to that.                You say there is a hole in the process the minute the furniture mover is gone?              Right.          I have one -- one question.     Could the Senate direct you to pay this judgment?              Direct your office to -- to do that.              Because it -- suppose they thought there was liability and if you say yes, then I need to know why you and counsel who just addressed this are on different sides of the case, if you're both representing the Senate.              Could it, if it chose?              All right.
06-6330 +++$+++                   Could the Congress have mandated the result and the rationale that the Fourth Circuit used here?              And is "reasonable" defined as an appropriate interpretation of congressional intent, or does "reasonable" mean something else, like a just sentence?                     What -- how do we define "reasonable"?                Whether or not the commission and then the district judge reasonably interpret the congressional intent, and if the commission reasonably interprets the congressional intent is the district court allowed to disregard that?                Assuming the commission was reasonable, can they still disagree?             So in your case you ask us to establish the proposition that in any case, a sentencing judge must always be free to disregard a reasonable interpretation of the Commission, a reasonable interpretation of a congressional statute?             You would go further -- you would go further and -- and submit to us the proposition that I -- that I just stated?             Reasonably.              But -- and I take it your submission is that the district court must be able to make the determination that the commission's policy is to be disregarded in every case to come before the court?

06-6407 +++$+++                 Is it material to your position to show that there was deterioration in his mental condition between the time of the sentence and the time you brought the petition?                   I.e., the -- during his incarceration, his condition worsened?              Then if you get beyond the second or successive question, your next point was whether or not AEDPA applies?             In the course of your argument, could you answer this:               Suppose we find that the State did not comply with the mandate of Ford because it didn't give adequate procedures to the defendant, it did not give him an adequate opportunity to present his defense.        Suppose we find that.           I'm going to ask the same question of the State.                 Does that mean that the district court should then send it back to the State?   Or is the district court at that point entitled and required to hold a new hearing on the substantive issue of Ford competency?             Would it be within the discretion of the district court to send it back to the State?   And say well, now you didn't give the correct procedures and that's -- an invalidity.                 So we're sending it back to you.        Would the district court have discretion to do that?             It may be much harder for you to get that standard on this Court's review of a collateral proceeding than this Court's review of a state proceeding, because of AEDPA.             Because?               Your position is that the affidavit submitted to the district court by the psychiatrists are sufficient to vindicate your substantive position that he cannot be executed under Ford?
06-666 +++$+++               Suppose a State said that it was unlawful for anyone other than a State resident to purchase the bond?                 Would it be constitutional to say that the holder of the bond must always be a Kentucky resident or, if you sold the bond, it has to be to another Kentucky resident?                 So if New York has a very strong financial community, it can really benefit its citizens by keeping the market in New York bonds for itself, if it chooses?             And your case for that is what, United Haulers?             I think that's true. There's a national securities market.                    Everybody knows that.             And I don't think either side can avoid that fact.           He's suggesting that it cuts more in his favor than it does for yours because you are creating artificial barriers to that market.                   So that when a person who knows about Kentucky bonds and who knows what the good ones are moves out of state, he all of a sudden loses the advantage to purchase those bonds anymore, or at least he does -- he takes a penalty for doing that. Let me -- let me ask you this, the question I asked your co-counsel.          A and D get together and agree on reciprocal advantages for their -- for their respective residents.       Is that constitutional?                Suppose it's not.   And --                And isn't that exactly what's happening here?        Isn't that exactly what's happening here?    You have, in effect, a pact among States to favor their own residents.                I suppose any favored legislation favoring local industry helps the State, and the State residents like it.              That's the whole point. That's why the Commerce Clause exists as a check.                 All politics is local. All States want to protect their residents and make it look like they're doing something for their residents. And that's exactly the purpose of Commerce Clause prohibition against explicit discrimination, which is what this is.     There's no doubt that this is explicit discrimination.              What are -- what are examples -- what are examples of Federal statutes that have allowed explicit discrimination?              In the insurance industry?
06-6911 +++$+++                Well, but even -- even there I assume the law waits for a certain passage of time, and I would assume that there can be no felony committed during that interim period or the person's sentence has to be served or something?                   It's ongoing, it's prospective.     And so restoration has a real component, in that -- that is not present in the statute that we're faced with here.                 Well, it is of -- maybe no difference if the operation of law is 24 hours later.                But I assume that's not the case.   I assume that there's in every case, as Justice Scalia's question indicates, a certain passage of time that takes place.             Well, but I'm suggesting -- and I haven't done the research -- that that's atypical.                I think it's atypical to give a felon one day in jail.             Do you know, since you seem to have looked at it:         In North Carolina, for the person whose had his civil rights taken away, is -- is there any mechanism to get them back earlier by -- by applying for clemency or a pardon or --             That would be about the only way?
06-694 +++$+++              Suppose the distributor attaches the movie review.           It's in amazon.com, and then it has the movie review.              And is that your answer to the -- all of the hypotheticals that are put forth in the Coalition for Free Speech, the Catholic Bishops, the advertisement in amazon.com or Netflix, then?             Let's -- pardon me.             Let's assume for the moment that there are minors, so that the content aspect of it is film.             That there are real minors in some of these things.             Yes.             Yes.                 Right.                 If one had a hand held video at a school or something like that?                 There are two things that you -- that all of us have to work with here.                  One is the scienter component here.              Is that overly broad, vague, and so forth?        The other is the content. And my concern is the same as that indicated by Justice Stevens at the outset.                  There are some terrible practices in the child-trafficking area where children are held in brothels for the most debased of acts.   There are abuses in prisons, abuses in schools. If there are videotapes showing those things, it seems to me that the statute is -- that they're clearly covered by the statute, and maybe even a killing of a little girl in public might be sadistic. Assume that that's covered by the statute. Is there anything in the "presents" and the "promotes" language in the scienter component of the statute that gives some protection to these materials? Is it just as-applied?       Is that what we have to do?              So we want the public to see this to show them how bad it is, and that is permitted under the statute, because it is not "presenting"?              I agree with you that we have different motives.                But I'm not sure that the statute covers that.             Can we reject the overbreadth challenge here and still leave an overbreadth doctrine for some other cases?                I'm not sure how we could do that.
06-713 +++$+++                Well, if it's your position that the parties are not really injured or affected by this, and the parties' position is that they are, who should we believe?               I mean, it's hard for you to tell the parties that they don't know what's in their best interest.             Well, there is evidence that, in other States, those who preached racial hatred have tried to associate themselves with a particular party, much to the concern of that party, and I see nothing in your position that would prevent that.               And is the remedy for the party, you said, to have more speech for the party, to say that this is not their candidate, etcetera?               But this Court has said that parties could be strictly limited in the amount of moneys they spend to endorse a particular candidate.              I don't think the law can have it both ways.              I was going to ask the counsel for the Respondents, and you can answer as well, can you explain to me briefly the existing structure for the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, to say Mr. Smith is our nominee?               Does the State have a legitimate interest in weakening the influence of political parties?               If we found that that was the necessary effect of this ballot measure, then would it be invalid?
06-7517 +++$+++ 
06-766 +++$+++               Just focus on, if you would, Mr. Olson, on the election for the delegates. Now, suppose it were shown -- a hypothetical case -- that it's extremely difficult to get on that ballot.    You need, let's say, 2,000 signatures in 30 days.     Would there be a constitutional issue raised by that situation?              A hypothetical case.              What about Kusper, the Kusper case?                I think we have made it very clear that if you're going to use a primary system, you can't have such burdensome registration requirements that the primary system is not, to all intents and purposes, to all intents and purposes open to those who wish to participate.                So you think that in Kusper, if -- if there was reasonable access to a general election, you can structure and stifle the primary any way --                I'm just looking at the principle here, and it may be that you'll say that there's no burden here, et cetera.                   But I just want to know:   Isn't there a constitutional principle that we are entitled and we must look at the fairness of the primary system insofar as participation of the voters?               Just to make it clear, is it your position that, with reference to this election for delegates, the State can make it as burdensome as it chooses on those who wish to put themselves forward on the ballot as a proposed delegate?                But if there is a State-mandated primary, I thought it's basic law that the State may not place unduly restrictive barriers to participation in that primary.               I think that's a given, it seems to me.    Now, tell me if I'm wrong --                And then we can argue about whether the burden is too great here, which it may not be.             Do you think a political party could say, you can't vote in our primary unless you've been a member of our party for 4 years?              This would be a State-mandated party primary for --              -- election --              You say the State, your mean the State statute?
06-7949 +++$+++                 If it had been the other way around and the district court had said what appellate court said and the appellate court had said what the district court said, what would you be arguing?                Well, you can see the systemic concern.    I mean, it's just not always going to be the case that the district judge is the one to give more leniency.              Going back to the Chief Justice's hypothetical and the colloquy you had with him with the hypothetical, the two different judges in the statement district or the same circuit that treat age differently, if the Congress saw that would the Congress be able to say anything about that, do anything about that to stop the disparity?               Consistently with the Sixth Amendment?
06-8120 +++$+++                Well, that's the question. Do you concede that this arrest was lawful?               Do you concede that the arrest was lawful?      The officer was obligated to arrest this person, knowing what he did, was he not?                Do you have any case in which we exclude the evidence seized incident to an arrest when the arrest is lawful?                I didn't think you did, and that's my concern.        I assumed that this officer was required to arrest the person, and we can have hypotheticals, he sees somebody wanted for multiple murders and so forth.       But I'm just not aware of authority which says that when the arrest is lawful and the search is incident to that arrest, that the evidence is excluded.   What's your best -- what's your closest case you can give me on that?                Can I have one please?                Thornton, I'm not familiar with immediately.    I'll look it up.                No, no.        This was the search of a person incident to an arrest, and I really jumped a little bit ahead of the questions that Justice Alito was proposing.        There may have been a moment in which the officer did not have the authority to act and he did, but it seems to me that once he has this knowledge, there is now an intervening cause and the arrest is proper, and the search as well.              What authority do you have that the operation of the exclusionary rule depends on the offense for which he was arrested?                Do you have any authority for the proposition you just offered?                The search incident to an arrest leads to an exclusion in one case and not in another case, depending on the charge on which he was arrested?              Well, do we have an -- an argument that something was seized from the driver that should not have been seized from his person?              Well, but I mean, that's not before us.              We're talking about evidence seized from the defendant.              Well, but there was only one, there was just the driver in the Brower case.              There was no passenger as I recall.              Well, but I mean in the case it's just not directly on point.                     That's what we are arguing about.              So that's just another case that doesn't help us.
06-8273 +++$+++                 Well, I propose if the State of Minnesota really cared about this, it could have its own confrontation rule.                Does it have a confrontation rule?                  That means the State isn't necessarily tied in knots.            It has the option to do substantively what it chooses.                 Well, page 2 of your reply brief, the yellow brief, you take issue with the State, and you say the State is wrong if there is a decision either way on the confrontation clause and it's questionable under Federal law, we can review it.                     I can concede that's right, but that doesn't get you home. That's the problem.               That is the problem. You're now creating a regime in which State courts are reaching questions that we said ought not to be reached for final convictions.               And that was the basis on which we decided Crawford.                  It's a general policy rule, but it may well, as in the Crawford case, as a good example, have affected this Court's initial determination to strike off in a new direction.                  We did so knowing that there's a possibility that we wouldn't upset final convictions.                  -- to that effect.              Well, even -- even outside of the habeas context, we -- we decided a case, Hudson v. Walker, one or two terms ago.               It was a no-knock case.   We said that, even if there is a no-knock violation, the exclusionary rule does not apply.                This would be too costly an extension of the exclusionary rule and would bring the -- would make the Fourth Amendment a disruptive force. Under your view, I take it, the State, even in -- in its trial proceedings subject to direct review, could disagree with that and take a Federal concept, no-knock, and then apply the exclusionary rule, thereby forcing us to make the -- to draw the very lines that we said we ought not to draw in Hudson.             But -- but you agree with me, then, that under your position, the State could apply an exclusionary rule.               You want us to write an opinion which begins with the sentence, "This Court has no interest in the extent to which its constitutional decisions upset final judgments"?
06-84 +++$+++               I have just two, two questions on, on willful and then -- because you may want to talk about the other issue in the case.                  First, you began by saying that here a district judge has come to the contrary conclusion; by definition, it can't be reckless.   Do you have any authority, where we -- for that proposition, where we have said that?                We find all the time that a right is not clearly established under AEDPA, and so forth -- and disregard what I just said.                  That's my first question. And the second is willfully, as Screws itself makes very clear, it is interpreted differently in the criminal context than it is in the civil context.              Why did they use credit reports?     Is it just a hedge against late premiums and the cost of late premiums, or does it bear on risk factors generally?
06-856 +++$+++  
06-9130 +++$+++  
06-923 +++$+++               Does it have to be just the specific decisions?        Suppose that the company does not have clear rules of, what do you call them, firewalls between the profit side and the claims processing side.   Would that be enough to cause a greater, more searching standard of review, say de novo?              So then you're saying, A, the fact that there is a potential conflict is not enough; B, the fact that there are no procedures in the company to ensure that the conflict doesn't affect the judgment, that is not enough either.               I'm positing.    Does the fiduciary at least have the, the burden of production to show that it has established clear lines of demarcation, firewalls, whatever you call them, within the company? Does it have at least that obligation going forward?               Well then, I don't know what effect you're giving to the fact, as the earlier questions have indicated, that there is a structural conflict.               You want us to write an opinion to say that it's irrelevant that a company does not have procedures to insulate the profit section from the claims processing section?               I'll use those terms.
06-937 +++$+++               I see your white light is on.     I have just one question.             Are there cases where some downstream restrictions on use might be necessary to prevent the patent from becoming worthless, i.e., in the biological area for replication of seeds in agriculture and so forth?                I thought Univis was one of your principal cases.
06-939 +++$+++ 
06-969 +++$+++               We all -- we all know -- maybe -- I think, I think it's accepted, that the public only tunes in to the political dialogue shortly before the election.    That's the time in which you -- in which you reach the public.       So the fact that the filibuster has been going on for a long time is -- I don't think answers the question as to how speech can be the most effective.               Are, are there frequent issues -- instances in the political process, do you think, in which the public runs an ad against a, a candidate knowing the candidate is probably going to win anyway, he or she is from a safe district, or it's very difficult.     But they want to run the ad anyway in order to affect his conduct or her conduct once they're reelected, so that they'll take a different position, a second look.               It -- it seems to me logically that's possible.            I just don't know if that, if that happens very often.
06-984 +++$+++               Well, I'm still interested in the answer to the Chief Justice's hypothetical.              Suppose the court acts beyond, clearly beyond, its jurisdiction?              Could you answer the hypothetical, please.             Suppose in this case the President did the opposite -- the same facts only the President said to Texas, do not comply with this judgment.             So then the President's --   -- determination is not conclusive.              My hypothetical is he's coming out the other way.          He says don't follow this judgment.   And you say he can't do that.              And I -- I think that that's not -- not consistent with your earlier position.             Can this court interpret the meaning of the Avena judgment if it's ambiguous? For instance, it said that a number of Mexico nationals have not received a hearing.             It didn't say all of them. And I have a problem, incidentally, because I think Medellin did receive all the hearing that he's entitled to under the judgment anyway. Can we interpret the judgment in that respect if it's ambiguous, not clear?             Can we interpret the judgment?                And can the President displace our authority to do that?               Suppose the President had reached the contrary conclusion, a hypothetical we put earlier.   Supposed the President had told Texas, do not follow this judgment?              I agree that we should give that determination great weight, but that's something quite different from saying that he can displace the authority of this Court on that issue of law.                 And in Nash he was being held under Federal custody.              So Nash is just inapplicable here.                 Of course, Nash is just a wonderful speech by Marshall anyway; it's not an opinion.
06-989 +++$+++               Well, in some -- one of the functions of a judicial -- what about an agreement, arbitration agreement, that the district court can find facts de novo?               Well, suppose it's a complex matter of monitoring emissions, looking at water quality, and the arbitrator has to sit by the river for a month, the district judge had to go down and sit by the river for a month.              But you have to give us a standard.    You said, you mentioned, oh, functions of the district court.   I don't know the standard you're proposing that will allow us to draw the line and to put cases on one side of the line or the other.                   You said, well, you can't interfere with the functions of the court.   I don't quite understand that.               I'm not sure why you have to give the answer you just gave to Justice Alito, if what you told Justice Scalia is correct, that the "if" clause includes the condition that the court reviewed for issues -- for errors of law.               Well -- but you're arguing to Justice Scalia that Section 9 works because you could interpret the "if" clause that way.               Now you're telling Justice Scalia, oh, well, it's a different action.                We have got the action here anyway.
07-1015 +++$+++              You said the first was that the court erred in saying that there was a -- a violation had been alleged.             And I wanted to reach the second, and I was wondering if the second would address this sub-question that I have.              If we were to say that Twombly is to be confined to the antitrust and commercial context, would -- would that destroy your case?                I do have the same lingering doubts as Justice -- or concerns or questions as Justice Breyer.      It's hard for me to believe we had to wait for Twombly in order to have this, and it seems to me Rule 11 is not applicable here because it simply works after the fact.
07-10374 +++$+++                 It does provide for a waiver of sovereign immunity and says that the State will respond in damages.          It might be -- I'm not sure -- that many prisoners would prefer this.                   They have got a solvent -- I hope they're solvent -- defendant. (Laughter.)                Well, we can just mark that place in the record.           It -- it does seem to me that there is some real benefits to the prisoners under -- under the New York scheme.           It's -- many counsel may think it's preferable than to sue under 1983.              Suppose the -- the New York legislature said, you have a choice, you can bring a 1983 suit or you can bring this sort of suit against the State, and the State will respond to damages, but you can't do both.      Can they do that?              No, no, I said in the alternative.              All right.      Now, suppose they do it -- they say -- we are just talking about the State courts:    you can't bring both types in State courts.    You can still have your Federal cause of action in the Federal court, and we will also give our cause of action where the State's law is violated, but not both in the New York courts.               You are being generous when you said that we would recall -- at least that I would recall the case.         Is it Idaho, did you say, or Johnson?               It was Johnson.       I thought you said Idaho.                 In that same act they might rescind the -- the laws allowing the State to respond in damages, in which case you won't obtain very much.
07-10441 +++$+++               Well, it would be consistent with the second purpose that you gave to say that there's a six-hour safe harbor, whatever term you want to call it, and beyond six hours the Court is free to reexamine its supervisory rule in light of what Congress has provided in (a) and (b) of the statute.              It is a little bit odd to say that Congress has built a statute around a supervisory rule, but taken away the authority of this Court to reexamine the supervisory rule.               Well, you were trying to get to page 7 of your yellow brief?              Well, is it your position that the MCNabb-Mallory rule serves purposes other than to ensure the voluntariness of the statement?              And that's what you're trying to reach here?              But if that's true, then why is it that we would suppress the confession if it's completely voluntary?      I mean, what's the link between some other end that's being served by MCNabb-Mallory --              -- something other than voluntariness and suppressing the confession?             But why do we want to avoid delay in presentment?            What reason do we give? And I assume there are reasons that -- to contact family and so forth -- other than voluntariness.             What do those rights have to do with a confession that is conceded, for our analytic purposes, to be voluntary?              But all you are doing is trying to have an enforcement mechanism for this by the wholly unrelated remedy of suppressing the confession if it's voluntary.    If it's not voluntary, of course, it's related.              So you are saying a confession can be coercive and still voluntary?

07-1114 +++$+++              Where am I going to find footnote 6?               And when -- when did the court indicate in -- in Tennessee that you had access to the file?               Oh, I thought that was 2000 -- when was that?               1992.                And the Brady claim has been pending in the Federal courts but just not decided since about 2001?              Can you tell me what -- can you tell me what is this -- let's suppose that -- that you have -- had an initial Brady claim that there was one part of the file that you were entitled to see that said that there is some evidence that he's a drug addict -- user.    And you take that Brady claim up. Later you find out -- you have access to a new file and you find cumulative information plus the information that he was dazed or something, which may not be very -- what's our test to determine whether the Brady claim has been exhausted?              Or have we talked about that?
07-11191 +++$+++          Suppose one person doesn't observe all the procedures.           One person prepares the sample, another person puts it on the paper, another person reads the machine, another person calibrates the machine.         No, no, no.       The evidence is presented, and the test comes out so -- positive, so that the gun fires or that it's a drug or that it's a DNA sample.     Can the conclusion be presented by one witness from the lab, when that witness did not observe all of the procedures?         I knew this case presented us a problem. (Laughter.)
07-1122 +++$+++              I didn't hear your first -- in your opening.     Did you say that Mimms established that it's likely that he's armed and dangerous?                    I missed that.             I'm sure it wasn't, but I missed what you said on that point.             Thank you.             So in your view, or I suppose the government's view -- well, I'll let the government argue for itself.             In your view, if the officer is just looking for the man in the gray overcoat and he stops someone on the street and says, have you seen a man with a gray overcoat, and the person says, well, I saw something like that, can he just suddenly spin him around and pat, and pat that person?                I guess what you're saying is that if there is a stop of the passenger and an interrogation of the passenger, the passenger can't say, incidentally, this is consensual, and thereby avoid a pat down?             And it seems to me there is some indication that that's what happened here if you credit the police officer's testimony.             In other words, you can have consent within the context of a stop that has not yet ceased.              The white light is on.    I don't want to -- but your opening argument that you presented indicated that a seizure is not necessary. You -- you wanted a further rule.              If the officer believes that a person is armed and might be dangerous, then they can pat down.   That's -- that's the rule that you proposed, I thought.              No, I disagree with that. The holding there was that the passenger was stopped, the passenger was seized, so this was a pat down in the context of an ongoing seizure.              Well, even if that's true, why don't we accept Mimms with the gloss of Brendlin?
07-1125 +++$+++               Would you agree that this Court invented the cause of action?
07-1209 +++$+++               And as between the two courts, the court of appeals, the Veterans Court and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, do we owe either of them, maybe not deference in the Chevron sense, but some deference because of their expertise in dealing with these claims, and if that is so then do we owe more deference to the court of appeals or the Veterans Court?              I mean it's an issue of law, so I take it it's de novo.               But in the exercise of that review, don't we have to give some weight to the determination of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims that sees these claims all the time?              I actually thought that that's where you were going to start out because you cited 7261, which says that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Claims shall, what, give due effect to -- take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.   And I think you could get from that that they have a certain amount of latitude in determining what the best rule is.    But you're not going to -- you don't tell us that?              But what about the notice, the original notice?        They don't have a lawyer at that point?     That was Justice Souter's question.            I didn't --
07-1216 +++$+++ 
07-1223 +++$+++ 
07-1239 +++$+++               I take it that you're are here because you find the decision of the Ninth Circuit, and I take it of the district court, prejudicial for the government on an ongoing basis; and what are the principal reasons for that?              And what particular errors?   The standard for review -- pardon me.                The standard for the grant or denial of injunction?                 What are the principal areas you want to present to us?             Let me ask you --             Would the irreparable injury have to -- and this just repeats Justice Stevens's question.             It is the same concern I have. Let's assume an EIS is required; let's assume it hasn't been prepared; let's assume the government project is going to proceed.                  You still have to show irreparable harm before you can get the injunction?             Do you have authority for that in the -- are the circuits unanimous on that point?             Then, let's -- let's assume standing.    Let's assume standing.               Let's -- let's assume people have standing.              Are there any authorities in the circuits which would indicate that irreparable injury is not required when there's standing, when an EIS is required, when an EIS has not been prepared, and when the government is ready to proceed?                   There is always irreparable injury before you can get an injunction?    That's what all the circuits say?
07-1309 +++$+++                 But you -- you imported -- I'm looking at your quotation from Turkette, at page 5 of your brief.    It doesn't seem to me conclusive of your point.    In order to answer Justice Scalia, you had to interpolate, to add various words.                   You had to say -- you said an ongoing organization with directions or something to that effect.            That is not what Turkette says.    Turkette says "as proven by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, that is continuing."   That's all it says.                Basically, you described this -- this gang.      One -- one person is a guard.                  The other person brings the hook to pull the -- the box off. Another person scouts it out.               Another person's got the scanner.   It seems to me to fit precisely what you have just described.                Isn't it pretty clear that if the -- the person who is supposed to be the lookout doesn't perform his job, he is not going to be included in that next heist?
07-1315 +++$+++              At some point during the oral argument, and perhaps at the beginning because it is the beginning inquiry:           When there is an evidentiary hearing, how does the standard for the court of appeals differ than when there has been no evidentiary hearing?             Well, let me put it --             Let me put it this way We're the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, let's assume.   What effect do we give to what the district court did, and how would that -- how would the case be different than if we were simply reviewing the same situation and it came from the State court?              What's the difference?              We just pretend the hearing didn't happen?             Do we look to the Federal court evidentiary hearing as part of the analysis to determine whether what the State court did was reasonable?    And you -- and you have -- you have thought about this, and obviously the problem is, since the California appellate courts didn't see the hearing, this is an artificial exercise, and you know the problem.               Did at any point -- did the State at any point challenge the correctness, the propriety, of holding the Federal evidentiary hearing?              And if so, is that before us?              But -- so then -- so then we do look at the facts.         I don't want to take up your or the Court's time on this any more, but I remain puzzled, I have to tell you, about what to do with this hearing.   I went through it at great length.            It's very careful factfinding, really.              But I -- I just don't know how to fit that with the standard when I look at the -- the reasonableness of the -- of the State court decision.             Well, if -- if the Profitt -- the Fifth Circuit -- Profitt, the Fifth Circuit case, applies in the Ninth, Ninth Circuit, and I would think it would, just as the magistrate judge thought that it would, then that would be -- present a very close case and it would probably require reversal of the State court, wouldn't you think, if the Profitt rule applied?    What is it, the "all or" -- not "all or nothing" --             "Nothing to lose."             Why is it, then -- if we say that and if Profitt is inconsistent with that, do we then remand or do we say on this record clearly it was reasonable?    Obviously you want us to do the latter, I take it?             Don't we have to go -- don't we have to say that this was reasonable?             Of course.

07-1372 +++$+++               But would the state of Hawaii, under Hawaii law, be entitled to take the position, if it so chose, that as the new owner of the lands, it has a special duty as a trustee that some other owner might not?             But then -- then it's just a question of whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court -- assuming that it made the decision that I hypothetically stated -- whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court, as opposed to Hawaiian legislature, could make the determination of whether or not there is some special trust obligation imposed on the State of Hawaii by reason of its own duties.                Well, I'm not sure it would be prudent when the great bulk of the opinion is based on the Apology Resolution.                And I -- I certainly do think you have a powerful argument if the Apology Resolution presents us with a Federal question.                   But the more far-reaching question -- I just inferred -- suggests -- might not even be very specifically within the question presented, and even if it's fairly embraced, you used the word "prudent."                   It seems prudent for us to confine our decision to the effect of the Apology Resolution and whether or not the Hawaiian Supreme Court got that part of that right.
07-1410 +++$+++              Are there cases in the courts of appeals where Indian tribes litigate with the Secretary and claim an abuse of discretion for the way in which the Secretary performs the duties with respect to Indian lands?              I -- I recognize that, but I want to know, is there a body of law in the Federal Circuit that generally recognizes that the -- that the Secretary has a fiduciary obligation that's enforceable as a matter of administrative law?              I meant all of the circuits.              Well, what I was asking was whether there was some doctrine that the -- that the trustee -- that the Secretary acts in a capacity, a fiduciary capacity as a trustee.                 If that doctrine were out there, then that might be the basis for saying that it's a sufficient foundation for a money damages.                 I was just asking, is that doctrine there?              Well, that --              But it says "the development or utilization of natural resources."              Well, why isn't it a public purpose to develop Indian minerals?                 That benefits the Indians and whole country.              No, it says "public."               Well, even if -- if I may have just one minute, Justice Souter. If you get revenue from the natural resources, why isn't that a public, religious, educational purpose?      They get revenue from leasing.               I just -- I just think you give too cramped a reading to section 5.
07-1428 +++$+++               Well, let me ask you this -- this question, and I don't mean to interrupt your answer, but it is based on what Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg have both been asking.                   Hypothetical case:     The city says, our test is not very good.                 We need a new test. The expert says, don't pay us to have a new one.     There are two great ones out there.               One is in City A.     The other is in City B.              Use either one of those.     They are great. They check.        They find out that City A has a disparate impact in the statistical sense, not in the legal sense; that it disadvantages minorities, at least if you look at the passage rates.                  The other test doesn't.     Are they permitted to take the test that doesn't have that differential?                My -- my question is -- and you can answer, I guess, both under Title VII and -- and under the Fourteenth Amendment.                      The city says, the only reason -- the only reason for our selecting the test from City B -- and both tests are very good tests -- is because minorities are better represented on the passing rate.   Is that permissible?                And do you find -- and do you find any constitutional deficiency in the city's choice in that hypothetical case?                 Is there any Fourteenth Amendment problem?             No.      No.    It was --             It was designed to show, and maybe it's theoretical, but I want to know the answer so that I can understand this case.                  It's designed to ask you the question whether or not race consciousness is ever permissible.             Well, counsel, you know, I've given law school examinations, looked at them, and bar examinations for years.             There's never been one, when I don't look at it after the fact and say, you know, this could be better, this -- this was not quite right. So shouldn't there be some standard that there has to be a significant, a strong showing after the test has been taken that it's deficient?                Before it can be set aside?               But it looked at the --               Counsel, it looked at the results, and it classified the successful and unsuccessful applicants by race.               And then -- and you want us to say this isn't race?           I have -- I have trouble with this argument.              But that's inconsistent with your answer to the Chief Justice who was exploring whether or not what we have here is a -- is a racial criteria, pure and simple, and you say, well, it's general.    And then we point out that each applicant didn't have his name, but they had his or her race.
07-1437 +++$+++  
07-1529 +++$+++                  I just want to make sure I understood your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question. Assume a lawyer is appointed.               The defendant says, "Yes, I want my lawyer."      He's in the jail cell.             The policeman walks by, he says, "I have a lawyer, but I want to talk to you now."            Can the police talk to him?                 All right.      Well, then it seems to me that the Miranda protections give you all -- or, the Miranda rules give you all the protection you need.              Well, I'm wondering if there is some further rule, could the prosecutor talk to the defendant if the defendant was in the cell and the prosecutor walked by, saying, "I know you have an attorney, but I would like to talk to you"?                    Could the prosecutor do that consistently with the Sixth Amendment?              Really?         The lawyer --              The lawyer can talk to a client for another lawyer?              Well, again, if that's -- if that's the principle that you're operating on and that you'd concede, then I think the Miranda warnings would suffice to give all the protection you need.               But wouldn't that be a Miranda problem?               Miranda.                You think, given Moran, that there was no Miranda violation here?

Is Shell liable there under the statute?             I mean, hasn't it arranged for the disposal of the --             Well, I'm -- I'm not sure that I agree with your answer.              Can you give me an example under this statute where Shell might be an arranger -- give me some hypothetical in which Shell would be an arranger?               Why isn't that the case in my hypothetical -- it's just a hypothetical -- where the driver catches the five gallons that spills out of the hose every week and dumps it in the creek?               That's really the same as the question you answered Justice Souter, and that's an arranger under (3).              Isn't it waste when it spills?    You deliver -- you're supposed to deliver 100 gallons, 5 gallons spills; isn't that waste?              They know that -- hypothetical.     They know that in the course of delivery you're always going to spill about five gallons.                That's waste.              All I'm talking about is just a hypothetical definition of waste.              But we were talking about waste, and I just wanted to get your agreement -- maybe you won't agree -- that when the product is delivered and 5 percent of it spills, that is waste, and we can talk about the other parts of it later.                 And I suppose the district court, if it wanted additional evidence, could have said, I want additional evidence on this point.               Ms. Sullivan, just on the apportionment point, do you agree that it is your burden to show that this is a divisible harm, and can you tell me how you showed that?                 I'm really concerned about the time and the white light, but I'm -- I'm not sure you answered the Chief Justice's hypothetical about $2 million, which is an initial clean-up that has to be expended no matter how large the -- the spill was.                   How did you discharge your burden of proof to show that that is not the case here or that that is divisible?

Do you think -- there is always a concern in these cases whether or not we're going to be creating more inefficiencies for the judicial system; that is to say, the trial judge was incorrect in ruling that the trial was becoming a farce. I suppose you've weighed that cost against the benefits of the rule.     And what are the benefits of the rule, that the trial is quicker, that the appeal is clearer?              But I assume if there is error it would be structural error --              There would be no room for harmless error analysis.             But in either case, there's a farce.               A very rational highly competent person might want to make the trial a farce. Why should that case be any different than where the person does so because he's incompetent?               The State's interests are the same.   If the highly competent person deliberately wants to make a shambles out of the proceeding, the State's interests are the same.                Now, there are certain options available.      They can exclude him from the courtroom or something, but --              Could we have a rule that even if you are highly competent, if you make the trial into a farce, you forfeit your Faretta right?                And these were communications made to the judge before the trial started?             I take it standard competency principles laid down by this Court require that the defendant be present and that he testify if requested.    And the trial judge must question that defendant when competency comes up in the presence of the court.
07-21 +++$+++               I just think it's hard to confine your rationale if you say that any association could sue.    If it says, you know, there are people that if they knew what we were doing, if they knew this problem they would really want us to sue on their behalf, I don't know if I'm going to confine your rationale.              But clearly you answer all of those questions that you've just posed, that you've just responded with, "no".          So then your answer to Justice Alito should be no.              Although that leads to the next question, is whether or not there are ways in which the -- the central purpose of this law can be preserved but it could be less stringent.              But I'd like you to respond to both of those things.              That wasn't -- that wasn't the problem I had with your answer to that question. You posed a number of questions to Justice Alito, or a number of responses, but to each one of those your own answer in the brief was no, and therefore your question -- the answer to Justice Alito's question should be no, there is no system that you know of that can impose a photo ID.             Your answer is no.                You want us to invalidate a statute on the ground that it's a minor inconvenience to a small percentage of voters?
07-210 +++$+++              Suppose in a tortious interference case, the two tort -- there are two tort feasors, and they communicate with each other by mail. Is that a violation of the mail fraud statute?             In my -- in my hypothetical, there was no -- there was no reliance on anything said.    It was just used to facilitate the scheme.    And I assume the plaintiff could recover.               But without the mail fraud violation -- let's assume -- the tort would have been unsuccessful.   It would not have been complete.               Yes.      Yes.   Let's assume that.    And it was directed at this class of persons and it was relied upon by the county.                  It seems to me that that's certainly sufficient under the -- it's a mail fraud violation.             I mean, refer to the mail -- the civil RICO refers to whether it's a mail fraud violation.   You want to assume this additional reliance requirement.             That -- that there are predicate acts, yes. MR. DeBRUIN:        And they would have to form a pattern and all the other requirements that were significant would have to be met, but yes. And I submit in this case there is no serious dispute but that the allegations over the course of many years of the complaint established indictable mail fraud.   The issue is not whether the fact pattern is under the common law tortious interference or some other common-law tort. The question is:           Do the facts as alleged make out indictable mail fraud?               There is no question but the mail fraud statute is broad.                     It prohibits any scheme or artifice to defraud; and I believe that if the facts here were proved, the submission of false affidavits to the county on a regular basis, there is no need under mail fraud to prove reliance.               Is it the law generally in the States that an unsuccessful bidder can sue the successful bidder if the successful bidder misstated qualification? MR. DeBRUIN:          Justice Kennedy, the common-law rule actually was, I believe, in 27 of 40 States -- this unfortunately came up after the briefing -- that a disappointed bidder could bring an action at the common law if the allegation was one of fraud in the procurement.            So that the common law did not provide an absolute bar to claims like this. Now, again, the issue is:                    Will the claims satisfy Holmes and Anza?           There is no argument here that that standard, the framework this Court established first in Holmes and then applied in Anza, that that framework is inadequate, that it produces an anomalous result here or will produce an anomalous result in other cases.   It's a very rigorous test. This Court looked at directness; it looked to the suitability of other plaintiffs; it looked to whether the harm was derivative.                 That's a quintessential proximate cause analysis.                  Proximate cause is, historically through the common law, a very fact-based intensive test.            But the Court has made clear that the ability of the RICO plaintiff to overcome that test, it's a significant showing that must be met. Chief Judge Easterbrook, in this case, went through the Anza factors very methodically.                  He showed that, under each factor, proximate cause clearly can be met under the common law.            The Respondents were directly injured in a significant and substantial way, and that is sufficient, I submit, to make out the elements of the RICO claim, assuming all the other elements are also met. If there are no further questions, thank you.
07-214 +++$+++               Did the Navy have the right to audit the subcontractor's books?              Suppose they audit the subcontractor's books and they don't discover a fraud and leave.     Would there be liability then under your view?              The books show that X dollars were spent for certain parts and that was far too much.     That was an inflated figure.                It fools the government.     The government then paid the subcontractor -- pays the contractor; the contractor pays the subcontractor.             Well, you say (a), but we're talking about (a)(2) --             -- in connection with (c).             But you were quoting from (a)(1).             I know that, but doesn't (a)(2) stand by itself, especially as -- as (c) is written, (c) and (2), (c) and (a)(2) make perfect grammatical sense without any presentation to the government.              But you said given to the government.     It's "paid or approved by the government."               Mr. Olson, it seems to me you're fighting a hypothetical.               Let's say they built a lousy school, sub-spec.         The roof is falling in; the plumbing leaks.    It's a fraud, but they've given the money, the feds have given the money to the States and the States have let this slip by.                 Justice Scalia's point was the Federal Government has been injured.                 But the Tanner case didn't confront the statute which has the definition of claims that Justice Breyer is putting to you.              This statute that we're looking at, in effect, defines what a fraud against the government is.
07-219 +++$+++              You mean the captain --             -- is not a managerial officer for any purpose?         Suppose he decides that he's going to leave despite an adverse weather report?            Is he not a managerial agent at least for that?             Well, I'm -- I'm asking about the concept of the managerial officer in general. And I think that we can explore in this argument, whether or not The Amiable Nancy held very squarely about punitive damages, whether we ought to do so in the first instance.             And it seems to me a large part of that inquiry turns on what a managerial officer is and what -- was Hazelwood not a managerial officer for any purpose at all?              But I don't think the conductor is on a par with a captain.                     The captain has this huge vessel.     He can decide when it leaves.                  He decides the course.      And I think that "managerial officer" might be a divisible concept. Obviously, he doesn't bind Exxon for filing its tax returns or to decide whether there's a deduction.   But you are saying he binds Exxon for no purpose at all, ever.              Of course, we are talking about punitive damages but at the concept of a "managerial officer."        And I haven't heard why he isn't a managerial officer at least as to some things.               You're talking about tradition.     It has never been the tradition for criminal statutes to have open-ended penalties.                    So that -- that explains why the CWA has specific limits.              Well, perhaps that's a segue to point No.      3.     I don't wish to --              -- to cut you off.           On point --              On point No. 3 --                My only question is this Assume that there will be punitive damages applicable to Exxon under maritime law in in case.                      We have read in the briefs about the limits that should be imposed on these punitive damages.          And those are from our due-process cases. If we are deciding this case as a matter of our authority to determine Federal maritime law, are there factors that we should include in a punitive-damages framework that do not -- that do not appear in our due-process cases?                 And, if so, what are those factors?                And I take it, under that, you would point to the double -- the provision for a fine double the amount of the damages?                   That would be a factor?                I mean, if we're looking for guidelines --                -- double general damages is a factor that we could -- that we could follow in the maritime framework?             What would be the formulation of the rule if the Court thinks that any added amount would not deter, and how do we know that? How do you formulate this rule?
07-290 +++$+++              One of the concerns, Mr. Dellinger, of the framers, was not to establish a practice of amending the Constitution and its important provisions, and it seems to me that there is an interpretation of the Second Amendment differing from that of the district court and in Miller and not advanced particularly in the red brief, but that conforms the two clauses and in effect delinks them. The first clause I submit can be read consistently with the purpose I've indicated of simply reaffirming the existence and the importance of the militia clause. Those were very important clauses.                As you've indicated, they're in Article I and Article II.                   And so in effect the amendment says we reaffirm the right to have a militia, we've established it, but in addition, there is a right to bear arms.       Can you comment on that?             And this makes, it does -- I think you're write right in the brief to say that the preface shouldn't be extraneous.                This means it's not extraneous.   The Constitution reaffirms the rights, reaffirm several principles:             The right of the people to peaceably assemble, the right to be secure in their homes, the Tenth Amendment reaffirms the rights, and this is simply a reaffirmation of the militia clause.             Well the subject is "arms" in both clauses, as I've suggested is the common subject, and they're closely related. I think, as this Court              Well, do you think the clause, the second clause, the operative clause, is related to something other than the militia?              All right.          Well, then --              It had nothing to do with the concern of the remote settler to defend himself and his family against hostile Indian tribes and outlaws, wolves and bears and grizzlies and things like that?             But the Second -- the Second Amendment doesn't repeal that.                    You don't take the position that Congress no longer has the power to organize, arm, and discipline the militia, do you?             So it was supplementing it.    And my question is, the question before us, is how and to what extent did it supplement it.                    And in my view it supplemented it by saying there's a general right to bear arms quite without reference to the militia either way.             Well, there's no question that the English struggled with how to work this.                   You couldn't conceal a gun and you also couldn't carry it, but yet you had a right to have it. Let me ask you this:              Do you think the Second Amendment is more restrictive or more expansive of the right than the English Bill of Rights in 1689?             I think that would be more restrictive.             The purposes of what?             You said there is no showing that rifles and handguns.                 I think you meant rifles and other guns.             Is necessary for the purpose of what?   What is the purpose?              If I could just have one follow-on on Justice Ginsburg real quick.                  Do those States -- Justice Ginsburg asked -- - that distinguish among weapons, State constitutional provisions do not do so?              Because I did interrupt Justice Breyer.              I -- at least to me the question is, what would be the constitutional basis for insisting on Justice Scalia's suggestion that you need a number of guns?    You have argued, it seems to me, that the District or a government could prohibit just what he said, unless you needed one to take to the militia.             I'm asking about the constitutional standard you apply to a hypothetical statute which would prohibit the guns Justice Scalia described.    What is your position as to the validity of such a hypothetical law?
07-308 +++$+++                 Do you know, what happened before the Tucker Act with inverse condemnation claims? The government violates the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment Takings Clause applied to the Fifth by inverse condemnation, and there is no Tucker Act.     Was there a constitutional cause of action for damages?
07-312 +++$+++              Are there also instances -- and, again, I'm interested in Justice Breyer's question and Justice Stevens's question, the practical reasons that might have prompted the statute to be drawn in the way that you say it's been drawn.                  Are there also instances where a transaction goes through and is later unwound, is later set aside?              So that the tax has to be refunded?              I guess your point is that, as a whole, the virtue of the stamp tax is that it is virtually automatic on recording, and you don't have to send out notices, and so forth.              The whole point of the stamp tax.              I had one question as to operation of the tax in Florida. Suppose a transaction -- there's no bankruptcy.   A transaction is completed.                     Stamps are paid.   There is then a suit to rescind the transaction on the ground of fraud or mistake.                   Do you get your money back from the stamp tax?                 I can understand -- just taking a quick look at 365(g), why it serves a different purpose and a different function. But the Respondent's point was, you have to interpret "under" differently under your view, under 365, than under the statute at issue. Do you agree with that?
07-320 +++$+++                I'd like to ask about the provisions of the statute which allow the candidate who doesn't have the personal funds -- what was the name of the challenger in this case?             Not Davis -- Reynolds?               Reynolds -- - to receive, is it, unlimited contributions from his own party?               Yes.               Suppose you had a statute which either explicitly said or has the effect, as this does, that the less wealthy challenger, the challenger in Reynolds' position, has more access and more support from his party than the challenger does from his party? What is your best case that indicates that that is unconstitutional, and what is your argument that that is unconstitutional?             That concerns me in this. What is your best argument that differential treatment of the candidates vis-a-vis support from their respective parties is unconstitutional?             The statute makes that distinction.                And it seems to me that that distinction is somewhat questionable, and I'm asking you for your best statement of the theory as to why it's unconstitutional and your best case to show that it's unconstitutional.                But you make that argument to the statute generally.            Is there any more specific argument that you can make in the context of the less well-funded candidate having more support from the party than the well-funded candidate had?             It seems to me that that's a particular vice of the statute, and I want to know if there is a formulation that's more precise than the general attack that you made -- that you make.                But the party for the less well-funded candidate has the option to have much closer ties, much greater involvement, than the party for the other candidate; and that seems to me highly problematic.    And I want to know the best case that you have for that proposition and the best statement of law that can you give me for why that is unconstitutional.             And he cannot have the support from his party that the opponent can have from the opponent's party.             Not the same level of support.             And is party support sometimes important in an election?             Does anything in Colorado indicate that there can be a differential between the party support given to one candidate and the party support given to the other?
07-330 +++$+++              And it would also, I take it, be circumventing what could happen in the district court.   You have to move very -- seven days in the district court for mathematical error, and that's it.             Other than for assistance --             Perhaps that's after a new trial.             What happens if it's -- what happens if the sentence is five years, reversed on appeal, error in evidence, same -- same offense, same indictment?   Then you have to comply with the vindictiveness rules before he can give a higher sentence?             What do you think is the rule if there's a new trial and the judge says, you know, what about this, I heard the evidence again; I think I'm going to increase the sentence?              But what's sua sponte --              It's a resentence. There's a new judgment, a new conviction.                   What happens then?             Well, actually rule 35 was changed because it used to be based on the mandate.                But now rule 35 says you can reopen within seven days after the verdict or finding of guilty.               So that would indicate under the rules that the mandate is irrelevant.             Within the scope of the appeal, which brings us right back to this case. Within the scope of the             I don't know about your initial premise.   I -- I take it the policy here is that the defendant who appeals ought to know what's at stake in the appeal.   He shouldn't be surprised.             If he cross-appeals, fine; if he doesn't cross-appeal, he knows what the stakes are.             But now you're saying that if the sentence is -- is vacated, they can start all over?   That the district court can't start all over if it's still in the district court.                 Why should the court of appeals have any more authority than the district court does?
07-343 +++$+++               What about treason?          What about treason?   Even the countries of Europe which have joined the European Convention on Human Rights, I believe they make an exception to the prohibition of the death penalty for treason.          You can slaughter your fellow citizens, but if you offend the State you can be put to death. Is treason an exception from the -- our ban on the death penalty except for murder?             Mr. Fisher, your white light is on, and you do want to protect your rebuttal right, but you began by indicating that this statute could be narrowed.      It could be narrowed by a requirement of recidivist behavior.                       Are there any other narrowing categories?  One could imagine something  here? It is with respect to              This is not a speech case where you have standing to object to the statute that can -- would be unconstitutional as applied to others --              Or is -- contradicts.
07-371 +++$+++              If this case had been one in which were notice, before the suit was filed -- or at the outset of the suit, and some encouragement to go ahead with the suit, would that have fit your, I guess, second category of adequate representation, adequate opportunity to have your -- a case heard?             Yes.             From a fair --             And that is because?             But why doesn't that fit at least the semantic version of the category you gave us?             Your list of factors is cumulative?    They are not independent categories?                   Your category number 2 then is not a stand-alone category for barring -- for barring the second plaintiff?             But -- but that's not what -- that's not what your second category was.                     I understand privity, but you didn't -- you weren't just trying to restate the concept of privity in your second category, were you?             Yes.             Right.          Otherwise you would have just said privity.              Right.              Right.
07-411 +++$+++               Can you incorporate under tribal law. You cannot incorporate under              What general principle underscores the validity of your point that it's -- is it a republican form of government law, Due Process Clause?   What is the general principle you rely on to say we have to look to the structure of these courts? If the structure is insufficient, then it violates what prohibition in the Constitution?             Due process for whom?          The tribal courts aren't governed -- aren't creatures that are subject to the Due Process Clause.             What is -- what is the constitutional prohibition that is a restriction on assigning cases to a court that does not follow the Due Process Clause if it's an Indian court?                   It's not the same as if we assign this to the American Arbitration Association.    What's the difference?
07-440 +++$+++              But what we're looking for here, at least one of the things we might look for in this case, is a specific rule to give to the States so the State knows when counsel has to be appointed. In this case suppose the magistrate, the man behind the little window, said:             We're going to give you a ticket; keep in touch with us; don't change your address until you notify us; you're free on your own recognizance.   Would counsel have been required there?              How is that different from a traffic ticket?              So it's the warrant that makes the difference?             -- that a magistrate is required whenever bail is set -- pardon me, that an attorney is required whenever bail is set?             The rule is -- I want to know, what do we tell Texas it has to do in all these cases?    What do we tell jurisdictions that have to deal with traffic tickets?       Does it make a difference that you're held in custody or not held in custody?             I don't understand the rule you want us to adopt.             Well, what about my traffic ticket?             Other members of the Court can advise me about that.             I know -- when we were talking about traffic tickets, you said, well, that was a warrantless arrest.     This was a warrantless arrest.             And then --             It seems to me that our precedents do say, Gerstein versus Pugh, that the probable-cause hearing is not an adversary proceeding where counsel is required; and if we are going to give you relief, we have to go beyond what Gerstein says.
07-455 +++$+++               I guess what's troubling me, Mr. Attorney General, is that it -- it does seem to me fair enough to make that charge in this case; but then we -- but then we have the tremendous number of cases where the prosecutor is going to be in the position in a plea-bargain context, say, to threaten to charge this offense with a heavy mandatory minimum. My understanding is that district judges do not and cannot be involved in plea bargain negotiations; they can look at a plea before it is entered. What can you tell us about the safeguards that might exist in the system generally against - against overcharging, against charging for something where the result is close to absurd, as in some of these hypotheticals about the income tax return and the gasoline and so forth?              And I suppose if you thought there was a problem, you could promulgate them out of your department.
07-463 +++$+++                Could any one of those have brought suit?               But I mean -- but the letter alone, I don't know what the criteria were for the addresses.               Oh, okay.       Okay.
07-474 +++$+++               Well, I guess you begin with the proposition that the government must always have a reason for what it does?              So you have a national for-clause employment system.               You can only be hired for cause -- fired for cause.              But you're getting back to the point the government must always have a reason for what it does.    Can you cite me a case that says that?              Must always have a reason for the actions it takes.             Yes, those are all tax cases, or in Olech, 30 feet as opposed to 15 feet, where there was a clear difference that was not -- but there was also an allegation of an invidious motive.             It's just hard for me to get that sweeping provision out of Olech.             Do you think Olech was wrongly decided?               I don't find anything in Olech that says that every action that does not have a reason is constitutionally infirm.
07-499 +++$+++                Do we begin with the assumption that this is a Chevron deference case?                       And I think Aguirre, INS v. Aguirre, would tell us that it is. It was a different statute.               Do we begin with that assumption?               Well, do I begin with Chevron?             Do you take the position that the Government is wrong in saying that it's bound by Fedorenko and that's the reason perhaps for us to send it back?             And do we begin with the decision in Rodriguez-Majano, the BIA decision --              -- which cited Fedorenko?               But why does the Attorney General have expertise in -- in that area?                 I can understand why he has expertise when he knows that, from experience, that certain defenses are harder to prove than others, that certain evidence is harder to obtain than other evidence.      But does the Attorney General really have expertise in determining degrees of duress, degrees of culpability?        Is that within the Chevron framework?             I don't know why you -- I don't know why you concede that.
07-512 +++$+++               If I could just ask some -- everything you said is applicable to a predatory price claim as well as a price squeeze?
07-513 +++$+++                  Let's just assume the hypothetical -- the hypothetical:                  The computer malfunctions.                 I'm sure a computer might be compared to God, but let's -- (Laughter.)                But we want an answer --                We want an answer to the question.                Let's assume no one did anything wrong.                -- because this bears on the fact of why are we doing this at all.                And the definition of negligence is that he was not objectively reasonable?             But in that -- but in that hypothetical I think it might be easy to say that the policeman on the beat was not objectively reasonable in relying.             But that's certainly not the case here.              Suppose it were an agency like INS or Customs in which they have many people that are not sworn officers or some that are, does it make a difference who answered the phone?                 In Rand we said this is exactly the inquiry we are not going to make.                 Rand was where we had a traffic stop made by a narcotics officer.                       And the question was, well, he was going outside his jurisdiction.     We said we are not going to get into the way police departments are organized.                      We are just not going to do it.                 That's Rand.
07-526 +++$+++                 What sort of -- excuse me. What sort of tribes were not under Federal jurisdiction?                Pardon me.      What -- what -- yes, what members of tribes were not under Federal jurisdiction?                Were there, then -- were there persons of Indian descent who were not under Federal jurisdiction?                What -- what kind of persons would those be, persons without a tribal affiliation?               They wouldn't qualify for two reasons -- A, they weren't recognized; and B, they weren't, in 1934, under Federal jurisdiction?                   Or either?              Because I suppose that what the Government wants us to do is put in two commas: The Indian as used in section -- a person of Indian descent, comma, who are members of any recognized Indian tribes, comma, now under Federal jurisdiction.                   That still might not help if they weren't under Federal jurisdiction in 1934.              Even if they were recognized later?              You don't agree that "recognized later" complies with this statute in your case.
07-542 +++$+++                Do you have any views on the other case? (Laughter.)             Or location.             And this is important, but you had three -- three points.              One was the fact of the arrest; and, two, it must be contemporaneous.                And the third?                 But the bright line swallows up the rationale in this hypothetical where already he's handcuffed; he is in the car.               Is there a justification apart from Chimel for our keeping this bright-line rule?              Are there other -- are there other reasons that it's hazardous or dangerous or at least risky to leave an unattended car where other people can go in and maybe find weapons and contraband if the police aren't guarding it?                 I mean, are there other reasons other than Chimel for this bright-line rule?              What is the basis for your wanting us to adopt what we might call a bright-line rule for automobile exception?             What are the reasons other than officer safety which we think may not be a very persuasive reason.               Well, you keep coming back to danger.   And let's -- let's assume that some of us think that when he has been handcuffed and in the back of a car and he is about ready to leave the scene, there is no more danger.      I want to know if there are any other reasons other than preserving evidence for searching the car. It seems to me there are good reasons for searching that car.       It's -- it's movable.              That's the old vehicle exception.         It can have contraband in it. It can be stolen.     It can be taken for joy rides.                But you don't seem to make any of those arguments.                   You just want to keep coming back to officer safety and on that point I think your case is very weak.              Fine, if you want to go back to that, fine.       I have problems with the argument but if that's your argument I'll take it from there.                Diminished expectations of privacy are not a reason to search.                The only reason to search that I can find from you so far is officer safety.
07-543 +++$+++              Was this statute effective 180 days after its -- after signature?
07-5439 +++$+++               Well, if it were properly administered, would you have a case here?               Let's assume 100 percent of cases are properly administered.              No, my question --              Let's assume hypothetically, and we know this isn't true, that 100 percent of the time it's properly administered.               Then do you have an argument to present to the Court?                You were interrupted, and you gave Justice Ginsburg -- you said you have two problems for monitoring.           She asked you who would do this and what measures would they use.                And you were never able to get to the second.                Well, as to the cuff, I thought the record was rather clear that it is just not used at these low blood pressure levels.
07-544 +++$+++               I agree with Justice Stevens.    I thought that was the whole problem, the "or" and the "and" is the problem for you.
07-552 +++$+++                But you can make that same answer if it's just a standard assignee for collection of -- of a debt for single person.             No, no.         It's a full assignment, where everybody agrees that there's standing.             You can make the same argument:    Oh, he might not have all the information.                Well, I don't like to be the broken record.      I'm just not getting -- I don't see why that isn't the responsibility of the plaintiff.                    The district court said, now, you've brought these claims. The defendants need this information.                     You go get that. That's your responsibility.             And are problems --             Are the requirements of typicality and -- the same type of injury designed in part to preserve the rights of the defendant?
07-562 +++$+++               But suppose that a new drug is found for the treatment of a condition, glaucoma -- hypothetical -- and the evidence is stunningly clear that smoking with this new drug causes a severe allergic reaction.   Does the cigarette manufacturer have any duty to disclose this on the label or in promotions?              No, I -- they've just found this out last week.          Do they have any -- there can be no -- I take it under your position there can be no suit based on misleading or false promotion or labeling, and there can be no suit even for the sale of an unsafe item?
07-581 +++$+++              Yes.       What -- what --              I don't -- I don't wish to delay your reading, but -- but as -- as part of the decision we have to make, don't we have to have in the background the consideration of the -- that the -- the potentiality that the union might do just what it did here, and that would help, it seems to me, inform our decision on the question that you are presenting. Now, whether or not it's properly raised here, I do agree with you it comes rather late.                   But isn't it a factor that we must necessarily consider?               Well, that -- that means that if there is z totally frivolous claim and the employer -- pardon me, the union says we are not going to arbitrate, the -- the employee still has the right to then proceed?   The employer hasn't gotten very much.              -- very much for the bargain.              In the hard cases.              But it hasn't got the ability to have the union help them weed out frivolous claims.              Well, I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sure that employers nationwide would -- would -- would accept -- would accept that view.              And again, maybe that's -- that's a reason for us not to reach it in this case.
07-582 +++$+++                Well, is the agency's position that its policy has changed or that it has not changed?              Well, the court recognized, but it seems to me the FCC -- and this is what Justice Scalia's questions go in part to -- in the remand order at first it said its policy hadn't changed.              Are you talking about community standards for broadcasting?
07-588 +++$+++                 I think maybe what Justice Ginsburg was beginning to get at is my question here.     I assume that BTA is the most rigorous of the standards set forth in the statute.                       You can argue with that assumption, but grant me the assumption for the moment.    If BTA is more rigorous than the other standards, what is it in the regulations that reflects the agency's concurrence with that?                       What is there in the agency regulations that indicates that there is a more rigorous examination under BTA than the other standards?             Why didn't it use BPT or -- or one -- one of the other standards?                 If they are different, then one is either less rigorous or more rigorous.             Do you agree that this is a Chevron case?              Could the -- could the agency mandate a closed-cycle system, recirculating system --              -- for a whole plant? Could they -- under your view, could the agency, given its Chevron latitude, mandate closed circulation?              Just under the statute.              But it -- it seems to me -- of course, there are limits on what the agency can do, but if it couldn't mandate the closed circulation system -- I think I've got the term right -- if it could not do that, then this is not -- you're backing away from Chevron.
07-591 +++$+++                  Well, suppose --                 Suppose the tests were by John Smith, assistant lab technician, and you call John Smith, and you say, "Is this your signature?"                    "Yes." "Do you remember doing this test?"                   And he says, "I do thousands of tests.       I don't remember.               I'll tell you the way I always do them."            I mean, is that what you want?              Well, that's what you're usually going to get, isn't it?              Well, you know what you're going to get by looking, number one, at the States which allow this, where this happens all the time.                 You know what you're going to get in the States where the defendant -- where the defense can subpoena the witness. Now, if there are new tests, complex DNA tests and so forth, I suppose there is a lot to ask about.   Standard blood alcohol, not much to ask about.              You can raise all those questions from the fact of the -- from the document. Tell the jury, "This doesn't show what tests were performed."    It's there on the document.              In your answer, you said, well, there would be this stack of affidavits and that's all the State would have to do.               I think, Mr. Fisher, that was not quite responsive because the question here is whether or not there is an exception for business records.    Nobody is talking about affidavits, witnesses, and so forth.   We are talking about business records done in the ordinary course. It's true that it -- that the core principle is whether that confrontation is required, but the question is whether or not business records should be treated as something that are not testimony because they are done based on other protocols with other procedures where there is substantial insulation from the facts of the particular case because it's a routine scientific exercise. So I think your answer, I would agree, is responsive based on your theory of the case, but as a matter of practice and as a matter of the issue that's before the Court, I don't think it addresses it.             Well, but the railroad case was an accident report.           This is a scientific analysis.               But if you had what we can call an independent lab, that certainly-- you certainly can distinguish that from a police report.              It's a line-drawing question, I'll admit, but I think it's easily distinguished.              I wonder -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- if you -- if you didn't state your case strongly enough with reference to California.             I thought California followed the rule that you advocate here.              I'm not sure it's one more witness.     Labs are backed up with DNA.                 You know, the Federal budget for the courts, for the Federal courts, is $6 billion.    Well, $1 billion of that is spent under the Criminal Justice Act for experts and translators and counsels.    This -- this is a very, very substantial burden if we tell every State in the country that every -- in every drug case you are -- the State must produce the expert.                 What's your distinction with the recordkeeper?              What's your distinction from your own theory of the recordkeeper?                   Does the recordkeeper all have to -- do they all have to testify to testify that this is indeed the record?             The graph, spectrograph or -- or -- or the -- the chart is introduced.                Chain of custody is either stipulated or established.              Can a person who did not make the test testify as to what that line -- what that graph means, and would that be sufficient to convict?             No, but chain of custody is -- is quite different from the quantitative analysis and the professional opinion.             My question is only chain of custody has been established, that's gone to the laboratory, the paper is produced, an outside witness testifies to what the paper means.                 I thought you said that that suffices.
07-6053 +++$+++               But we are not -- well, but we are talking about the door -- the door opening here at trial.   Did he give notice that he was going to testify in California?       Do they have some rule that if you're going to testify, you have to give notice?              That tends to diminish somewhat, but not entirely, your, I think, quite proper response that this came in on direct not -- not cross.             Well, of course -- of course, that's true.      That is the reason for the confrontation -- confrontation rule.                    But it does seem to me that this is responsive to his defense; and you say, well, it's his state of mind, and her testimony was general.   I think it does go to his state of mind.              But we are talking here about the definition or the contours of the equitable rule, the forfeiture rule, for confrontation.                    And I think perhaps what Justice Ginsburg was suggesting, and certainly what I was suggesting, is that when we are looking at whether or not there is a forfeiture, we are talking about equitable considerations. Now, it's true in this case we are presented with an instance that I've never seen, which is that the murder itself makes the declarant unavailable for purposes of the equitable exception.                    And it is true that that goes much further than the common law did.               Well, but I think what Justice Breyer is saying --               But I think what Justice Breyer's line of questioning points out is that there were other provisions of the evidence rule followed in England which would not allow the testimony to come in, in the first place.       In this case, we wouldn't even have the issue before us if the testimony were not admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.                      It is admissible. Then we have to ask if it conforms with the Confrontation Clause, which is the issue we have.                     But because of the restrictions he points to, there was never the occasion for the common law to explore the boundaries of the forfeiture exception in the confrontation context.              Let's -- let's assume that the only case on the books pre-1789 was Morley, in which the defendant did specifically intend to keep the witness away from the trial.              But let's assume, contrary to fact, that the Morley case gave a -- a very sweeping, expansive definition of the equitable forfeiture rule and said the defendant cannot profit by his own wrong. Could we take that general language pre-1789 and say that it supports the rule today, assuming we could find that in the Morley case or other aspects of the common law?    Or would we be just confined, as you understand Crawford, to the specific holding of Morton that there has to be a specific intent?              Please -- please make the supposition.              All right.      Well, suppose we read the English authorities that it does not foreclose the expansion of the equitable forfeiture rule.              I -- I find that difficult to understand because the dying declaration rule came up in many instances when the confrontation rule was not involved at all.              Really?         I thought they came in, in civil cases all the time.             Well, but I -- I agree -- I'll check the, -- check --               But the forfeiture rule is designed to suspend the operation of the confrontation rule.   That doesn't mean that it comes in.                     You still need another hearsay exception which will allow it in.
07-608 +++$+++               What -- what -- what's been the underlying rationale for the rule of lenity, which is a rule I think we should apply with great caution?   But if we think -- what's the reason for the rule of lenity?              Fair notice.       It -- it -- it seems to me that if I were counsel practicing criminal law in the private sector, and I negotiated a plea for simple assault, but there was a spouse that was involved, and then I walked down the courthouse step with my clients, said we got a good deal, and incidentally, all guns in your house must immediately be surrendered to other people, you must take them all out, you may never hunt, you may never possess a gun. And under your view, if I don't say that I'm guilty of, it seems to me, serious malpractice.                 I just don't see that there is notice to the legal profession.              Well, but the rule --              No.      Where the context is, we are asking why the rule of lenity and the rule of lenity is to ensure notice.            And it seems to me this is a classic case where there has to be notice.               You could come back and say that even if the statute had been written as to apply specifically to domestic crimes, a lot of attorneys wouldn't have had notice on it when it was an omnibus budget bill added at the last minute.
07-610 +++$+++              Well, if we don't call it "insurance," can we all it "pooling"?               I did want to understand your position.    Suppose there is a statewide contract for public employees and one union brings a suit to interpret a provision of that collective bargaining agreement having to do with overtime or holidays or something.   And then it notifies the other union, we're going to have to drop this litigation because we can't afford it.   Even though it ultimately may affect you down the line, you're not a party.                   I don't see the harm in allowing the other union to subsidize or contribute -- use whatever verb you want -- that litigation -- that litigation.             What -- what -- what harm are we trying to prevent here?             The First Amendment can be -- can be a sword or a shield.                 This union wants to use it as a sword in order to promote, in order to protect its rights under the collective bargaining agreement.    I don't see the harm.              That's not quite the hypothetical.     Let's say there are two bargaining agreements but they're identical, and that this litigation that's underway will have persuasive force for the union that's thinking about entering, and then the union decides that it is going to enter to help the union involved in the suit, and the members of the, of the contributing union object and you say they have a First Amendment right.       That's your point?              I don't see why the objects of collective bargaining the, objects of union -- of the union, are not being fulfilled.              Could you tell us two hypotheticals.     One is the librarian, two is the public celebration.     Would nonunion, would participating unions be allowed to contribute to either of those activities?              Against nonmembers? Against members, there has to be a pro-ration, they has to be a pro-ration.       A with the librarian, B with the celebration.
07-615 +++$+++               I was going to ask that question.   In other words, there are cases or at least it is contemplated that there will be cases under the rules, where the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal does determine that there should or should not be an offset.              Yes.             But going back to the main issue, the only reason that this is at issue before the Iran tribunal is because it might be a setoff in the event of judgment in favor of Iran?
07-636 +++$+++               But again as a preliminary matter, am I on the same page with Justice Ginsburg?                   Or would it be a different question?                I'm curious to know why the beneficiary designation and change provisions at page 48, number 29c, beneficiaries, couldn't have been invoked here.   Is that the same question Justice Ginsburg was asking?              Because the plan does contain a procedure for designating some other beneficiary, including the spouse.                 I just don't understand why anybody doesn't talk about that.                 Well, of course, that was the point of my earlier point.                I focused on -- on this whole paragraph.                 That just indicates that this would have been a different case if the provision of the plan that said there shall be no assignment, which is quoted in the Fifth Circuit thing, was the only provision in the plan; but when you look through this in retrospect, there are means for participants and beneficiaries to make a change, and they weren't followed here.                 And I understand that you say in effect they were.           I understand that argument but it's not as if the plan didn't contain an adequate vehicle if the -- the parties had followed strictly the terms of the plan.              What do you want me to read here?
07-665 +++$+++                Well --               And I don't want to interrupt your answer to the Chief Justice because I think it's critical, critical to your argument.                  As a procedural matter, I thought that the Establishment Clause issue was raised in the initial complaint.                     Are you taking the position it's now waived or something?             It was under the State?             If you prevail, the action should be dismissed, as far as you're concerned?             All right.             Then getting back to the Chief Justice's point, it does seem to me that if you say it's Government speech that in later cases, including the case of the existing monument, you're going to say it's Government speech and you have an Establishment Clause problem.             I don't know if -- I'm not saying it would necessarily be resolved one way or the other, but it certainly raises --               -- an Establishment Clause problem.               Do you have to --               Did the NEA -- Finley v. NEA, the Court didn't treat that as Government speech.               Or am I -- is that the --                But, Justice Stevens's question is important, maybe not for your case but for other cases.    We are deciding this for other cases to arise, and why isn't he correct that if you don't like the message then that raises a content-based claim?                I understand that.                But it doesn't seem to me that you have to make the Government speech argument for you to make the argument that you just made.                And the same question Justice Stevens had, just to tack onto his question here, your answer was:         Oh, well, the Government owns it.   Suppose the Government says:                 We will accept ownership only if we agree with the message.                  That just puts his question.      I think the ownership argument is -- is not an answer to the Justice's question.              Well, under the Equal Protection Clause would -- if you wrote an Equal Protection Clause opinion, you would end up saying it's content-based.   That's the First Amendment.              I -- I don't think that can you avoid the hard part by saying, oh, other amendments of the Constitution might apply.                The heart of the question is whether the Government may discriminate based on content, and that's a First Amendment question.             Does the law always require us to adopt an all-or-nothing position?                    Aren't there some extreme cases indicated by the hypothetical where the First Amendment does enter in?                 Do we have to decide this case that it's all or nothing?
07-689 +++$+++               But under your definition of coalition district, race is the key factor.              And you are telling us if we have a rule that makes race the key factor then race doesn't matter.              I thought you were proposing a brave new world of coalition districts.              Based on race.               What's the authority that says you must consider race in drawing the districts, assuming that you don't have an existing majority -- minority-majority district?              What's the -- what authority do you cite for the fact that you must consider race in drawing districts?                       What do I read to find that?               No, that's -- that's a majority -- majority district.               Okay.           So then what other case do you have?               Well, then your statement that you must always consider race in drawing districts is not -- is not supported, or at least it's a new proposition that you are arguing for us here.             That's something new.   I thought we took the case -- at least I have been thinking about the case -- on the assumption that there is a valid State law that is being superseded.             Now, if you are questioning the validity of the State law, that's something -- that hasn't been raised here, has it?             I'm talking about, you're indicating to us that the county line standard that the State court invoked as a matter of State law is itself questionable because it was based on a prohibited racial animus.   And I -- I indicated that that's very new to me.   I thought we were taking the case on the proposition that the county line rule is a neutral, valid State law principle. Now, it may or may not be superseded by the -- by the requirement of section 2.                   That's what we are arguing about.      But this is the first time I have heard that we have to somehow question the underlying State rule under the Fourteenth Amendment. I thought we took the case on the assumption that the State rule is valid.              I'm talking about the county line rule.
07-6984 +++$+++               And you don't think you need to go beyond (A) to resolve the case?             And he can't go to Federal court until that is resolved?             If you do prevail, it is rather dramatic, because your client was stunningly negligent.   He does nothing for four and-a-half years, then strolls over to the State court.              Is the State statute that allows the early conviction to be set aside and the appeal reinstated -- do we have that statute?              I thought I had it.        Do we have it in --
07-751 +++$+++                That's what I wanted to know, and it gets back to the merits and not Saucier. We are going through two different things here. Assume this is an undercover officer, not an -- not a -- not an informant.               Now, the undercover officer sees a crime being committed, and he is ready to make the arrest.    Can he automatically ask for police assistance and -- and other policemen?                    Are the police then entitled to come into the home in your view, or do there have to be some exigent circumstances?             Just -- just to be clear, if -- if I may, I know your red light is on:                Your position is if an undercover officer is in the premises and sees a crime being committed, he automatically can invite police in to assist him in making an arrest without exigent circumstances?              What's -- what do I read? What authority do you cite me for that proposition?
07-77 +++$+++              If the respondent prevails in this case and you have a case similar to this one that begins in the trial court, how do you think it would work, that the plaintiffs in the trial court action have to get preclearance either way?              They have to get preclearance in the event that they prevail?              And then the other side has to get preclearance in the event that it doesn't.   I mean, is that the way it would work in your view?              If I'm in State trial court, how can I make a ruling if -- assuming the respondents win in this case, if I know there has to be preclearance?              I suppose States get -- State courts get preclearance all the time with district changes, don't they?      Or how does it work?          They just hold the judgment in abeyance until there is preclearance, and couldn't -- and if so, couldn't do you that here?                 But you said in answer to Justice Souter that this is your case.                    There is no law that's precleared.              Even in the hypothetical Justice Souter proposes, I don't know the rules in Alabama, but I can see a Federal court saying:                    Well, this is premature; it hasn't been precleared; why should I pass on the validity of something that might not be precleared?              How does that apply to a State statute which is fully enacted and then there's going to be a challenge?             Well, I take it it's your position -- and I noticed this in the question put to you by Justice Breyer -- tell me if this is wrong, but that it's not just the fact that the court makes a decision, because the court may have discretion to choose plan one, plan two, plan three, but it is if the court makes a decision to show that the prior practice was invalid, was void under State law.             That's the distinction, I take it. That's right, Your Honor.  just the court, but the kind of decision the court makes.
07-772 +++$+++               First, is there some constitutional minimum?       Let's assume direct review.           Is there some constitutional minimum requirement for scienter with reference to an accomplice?              What is it?              Is that the same -- is that the same as purpose?              Well, but you don't take the position, do you, or do you, that Washington law conforms to the Model Penal Code?                  I thought the Model Penal Code was much more defendant-friendly than you're stating.              So you're -- would -- would you say that the trial court in Washington states law correctly if it says that being accomplice you have to have a purpose to facilitate the commission of the crime?              But you agree there is a difference in "knowing" and "purpose"?              It's toward the bottom of page 123.    And I have the same, I have the same, just tieing onto Justice Souter's question, on the same subject.    It seems to me that that hypothetical is not necessarily correct.
07-773 +++$+++              All right.        So you define "look through" as -- under our hypothetical here as looking through to all people who might potentially be parties under this arbitration agreement.             I will think about that. I'm -- I'm -- I wasn't -- it wasn't clear to me that that was so.             But that's not quite so, because the -- the action could proceed with just A and C, and then it -- it could come to a complete judgment as to them.    In the look through for the -- the claims that are involved, the action couldn't possibly proceed without taking account of the pre-emption claim that the Federal -- the Federal claim. You couldn't -- you could decide the case completely in No. 1, the diversity case, but not in No. 2.   So there -- so there is a difference.                 It's true, you don't decide it completely as to all parties.              What about a Federal defense?
07-8521 +++$+++                   Well, but he couldn't find it inappropriate, could he?               If you're again talking about the plain language of the statute, I don't see there's much room for the district judge to say:               Well, now, I'm not going to say that you have to participate in further state post-conviction proceedings, the unexhausted claim.      It seems to me under your reading of the statute the appointed counsel, say in an unexhausted claim instance, would have to under the statute represent the defendant in further State collateral post-conviction proceedings.             So you would interpret "all available post-conviction process" as meaning federal?                I just want to make clear what your position is.         Federal determination on habeas corpus, that there are unexhausted claims, ordered to return to the State court:            Is the appointed counsel required under the statute to represent the defendant in the State court in further post-conviction proceedings?                Do you have to take that position?   But that is your --                But that is your position?
07-854 +++$+++              Was -- was there an element in Imbler of the fact that you have to make tactical and strategic decisions at -- at the moment that are difficult, that call for judgment that has to be exercised on the spur of the moment? This is somewhat different.                This is -- this is a long-term commitment or a long-term policy that the Respondents are arguing for.           It seems to me somewhat different than the dynamics that inform the Imbler decision.                Well, I -- I suppose that is why the Petitioners seemed to change their theory. They -- they -- they were -- they were concerned about prosecutorial immunity, so they take it to the higher level of policy. When -- when they do that, I suppose they might have the stronger argument if they could show deliberate indifference.           Are there cases that help them on the "deliberate indifference"?                  What's -- what's the best case for them on deliberate indifference?                That is why the case is hard, and I -- I almost have to see what the violation would be before I could determine the qualified immunity aspect of the case.             That's what we are deciding in sort of in a vacuum.                It's a little difficult.             The Monell case -- does the Monell case rest on the assumption that there can be instances where a policy makes the policy of those who adopted the policy liable?              In the broad ethical scheme of things, apart from liability under this statute, it seems to me that a newly elected district attorney would take seriously the obligation to make sure that everybody was following Brady.              Well, that's the next point.   If I were a prosecutor, I would say:           This is my constitutional duty to say it, in the broad sense of -- of my ethical obligations of my duties to the public.              Well, I think it's more than that.   He can't be indifferent to sloppy practices in the office --             -- consistent with his or her obligations to perform their duties.
07-869 +++$+++              If you -- if you think of the case as a principal-agent case so that the principal can direct the agent as to what to do, the agent being the county, then it seems to me that the unions might still have an argument that this is an unconstitutional condition. I've been looking for ways to examine this case.   The public forum doesn't really work for me. Subsidy doesn't really work for me.                     It seems to me to be an unconstitutional-condition case.                    At least that's the argument. That doesn't mean you necessarily can't prevail.     But suppose the State told the city:                 You can't have a parade that you sponsor for this particular cause.     That would raise an unconstitutional-conditions argument; wouldn't it?              Why isn't it?        And I say that because I think that follows on Justice Stevens's line of questioning.        I didn't mean to interrupt him, but it seems to me that is consistent with what he is asking.              You stand up and say that this isn't viewpoint -- that this is -- that this is viewpoint-based.    Isn't it where the union --                  and aren't they right about that?             The general proposition that underlies your argument that the local entities are creatures of State law and they cannot receive Federal powers from the Federal Government when the States object, is that -- is that an acceptable proposition?             Right.             There is -- there is a case out of the Ninth Circuit, and it was affirmed by this Court on a procedural point, but not on a -- not on the merits -- out of the neighboring State of Washington, where the State says a locality cannot build a dam more than 25 feet high.              The locality then gets a license from the Federal Power Commission, and the State said, well, you still don't have this authority.                  And the Ninth Circuit said you do.               The Federal power then supersedes. Would you agree that that case is valid?             Because there the local entity has powers greater than what the State wants to give it, even over the State's objection.              Really, if the State can -- can opt not to do something, it can't tell its subdivisions, we don't want you to do it, either?                And the subdivision can then go to the -- directly to the Federal Government and say, please let us do this, even if the State would be free to reject it on its own?              It seems to me that that is the argument you should be making here.
07-901 +++$+++                  The rule does bear on culpability, and culpability sounds like part of the definition of an offense or a more serious offense.                I don't understand why this happenstance is required to do it under the statute.   I didn't quite understand that.                You said it's only happenstance.   He has to do it under the statute if he makes the finding.
07-9712 +++$+++                So you want to us make the inference that the impermissible or criminal activity was permitted by the absence of this specific clause. You say there is no implied condition, no implied covenant?               Well, the questions so far indicate that one of the promises was an implied promise that you will keep the terms of the agreement by lawful behavior.   So that just -- what you say just begs the question. Now, I recognize the government has conceded a breach, and we will probably move on from that point. But, as Justice Scalia indicates, it puts the case in a very artificial posture, it seems to me.             Under the law of contracts I assume -- I haven't looked it up yet -- that you can't rescind for a nonmaterial breach.                 A trivial breach doesn't always allow recision.               And isn't it trivial if the district court said:          You know, I don't care if the Attorney General of the United States and the Solicitor General himself both came into the court on their hands and knees begging me to do this.                I wouldn't do this.    I wouldn't give you an increase.             So it seems to me an immaterial breach, other than as to one level -- and correct me if I am wrong.           I take it as to level one -- or as to the third level, they need the recommendation before they have the authority to reduce.                 Am I right about that?              There are some instances in which the -- the prosecution must make the recommendation before the district judge has the authority to depart downward, am I correct?              That's right.         So -- so this -- this district judge, I take it, did not have the authority to go down by -- by a third without the recommendation?              Even as to the third level, the district judge said, you know, I will assume that they have made the argument.                 I will assume they have made the argument.        I wouldn't hear the -- I -- I wouldn't grant -- I wouldn't follow the recommendation. I am not going to depart downward even assuming the government -- it seems to me that there is -- the government's breach is immaterial.              My reading of Santobello is the same as yours on that point, and it's difficult for me to understand.              Well, but I take it -- you never really answered Justice Alito's question.                I take it that the defendant and his counsel can knowingly recognize that an error is being committed, say nothing, listen to the sentence, and then object later.                That's your position, yes or no?
07-984 +++$+++                 If the discharge comes from a single pipe, is it always one or the other, or can it ever be both fill and --              What happens if the agencies disagree as to whether it's fill?                If 404 says it's fill, EPA says it isn't, can the EPA then veto it on that ground?              But there are still going to be cases, I would assume very close cases, even under the present standard, where there could be disagreement.              But I thought -- I thought your brother would say:          But that does not respond to 306 effluent.
07-9995 +++$+++               Just as an example, to follow up on Justice Breyer's question -- and then can you answer his question -- many States have -- have rules that you have to be a resident of the county to serve on that jury.     And suppose a juror thinks that he or she is a resident and gets the county line wrong or doesn't know what the residency requirement.            Under your rule -- what is your term, an "unlawful adjudicator." And then we have a -- we have a -- a Federal constitutional standard that requires structural error for any State -- for any violation of any State -- State rule.   That is Justice Breyer's question.              You are -- you are avoiding the question by saying, oh, don't worry, there are not going to be many violations of this sort, and then you pick out age.           But Justice Breyer began -- the preface to his question was -- was that there are -- are manifold requirements varying from State to State.                 What you are giving us is a sweeping proposition, A, for the constitutional principles that you are setting forth; B, for the supervision and intrusion it would cause Federal courts on the State system.              Well, our footnote in a later case authored by Justice Scalia indicates considerable doubt as to the viability and to the correctness of that formulation in Swain.              Salazar, I think, is the --               No. No.         I thought you were citing Swain -- and I think you are going to have to establish -- that peremptory -- to win your case, that there is a constitutional basis, a constitutional right to exercise a peremptory challenge, at least -- then you can you have a subset of that -- when the State gives it to you.    But I think Swain no longer stands for that proposition.               But -- but how -- how could it do that if there were not some underlying Federal constitutional right?              I say "how could it do that."   It obvious that they did it; but what -- what would be the principle basis for that analysis?               What would be the analytic framework that would lead it to look to the Federal decisions?               This is a State issue.               But we are asking you what the analytic justification for that course of reasoning is if that is indeed its course of reasoning.               Well, but you have to give us a sustainable analytic framework if -- if we are going to reverse their decision.

08-103 +++$+++                Would -- if the statute of limitations had run, could you still come back?               I mean, not -- not necessarily in this case, but in -- but in a typical case.              I said in a typical case.              Or is it just --               Maybe this is the same question.   Are you representing the interest of the Library of Congress?
08-1065 +++$+++                  Your -- your case here is a polite way of telling us we wasted our time in Buckley v. Fitzsimmons.                 I mean, we were just spinning our wheels in that case?              Take two cases.   One is Justice Ginsburg's case, a police officer fabricates the evidence, dupes the prosecuting attorney, or -- or doesn't fully disclose.         Case two, a prosecutor does the same thing and gives it to a fellow prosecutor. Same -- should the analysis be precisely the same?              So the -- so the law is the more deeply you're involved in the wrong, the more likely you are to be immune?           That's a strange proposition.              What if a prosecutor knows that it's fabricated evidence?            The police officer fabricates the evidence and says:               Mr. Prosecutor, it's a very bad man; I fabricated the evidence.               The prosecutor introduces it.        What result there? See, your footnote 6 presumes that the prosecutor doesn't know.              Suppose he knows?              Against the policeman?             Again, the more aggravated the tort, the greater the immunity.             You're basically saying that you cannot aid and abet someone who is immune, and that's just not the law.             Well, you can't have it both ways and say this is a policy we should take into account and then when Justice Sotomayor asks you a question, say:   Oh, well, that's for the legislature.               I mean, you're -- it seems to me you're trying to have it both ways.
08-108 +++$+++              Would it be enough to go to the jury on the hypothetical Justice Alito gives you?             You agree that you could go to the jury whenever there is an identity card that does reflect the identity of a real person but there is no other knowledge that the government's case is introduced that shows -- that there is no other evidence that the government has introduced showing knowledge?                 Suppose he has five different cards with five different real people, would that be enough to go?                 No, no.          No. The fact that he testified, that doesn't have anything to do with whether or not the case goes to the jury.                      Does the government make its case sufficient to resist the motion -- the directed motion for acquittal if it just puts in the fact that you have five identity cards and there are five different people and they are all real people?               No, no.          You have to have the further inference that he knows that.               That was going to be my next question.   The next question is suppose it was the Petitioner's own name but somebody else's number.               Even if he had five different cards, all with his name, but all with the identification numbers of other real people?              Does he have to know that? Suppose he uses John Smith.              Does it suffice that -- do we have to show that he knows there is a John Smith in the phone book, someplace in the United States?               But I want an answer to the question.               And it can't be submitted to the jury on the basis that anybody knows that there is a John Smith?               Can -- can it go to the jury without any other evidence other than the fact that -- his possession of the card?              Can you give me an example?              But if you say this goes to the jury, it doesn't leave very much to your knowledge argument.              I mean, I suppose that defense counsel can get up, say the government hasn't shown that he knew this, and then the government says that of course he knows it -- I don't think you have accomplished very much.               It's not a clear -- what -- what if the accused knowingly uses a card -- identity belonging to a dead person?                     Is that a real person?               What is your view?
08-1107 +++$+++                 Not all diversity suits have major law firms in them and a lot of resources to spend in -- in discovery to determine more complex tests.
08-1119 +++$+++                 If it were confined to unlawful activity and narrowly drawn, do you concede that such a statute would be constitutional?                You say "perhaps."       Yes or no?   Can Congress by an appropriately, an appropriately drawn narrow statute, prohibit attorneys from advising, A, criminal conduct in reference to a bankruptcy; or, B, civil conduct -- conduct that is improper under the civil code because it's a fraud on creditors?              Well, again in the hypothetical context, could Congress enforce by a statute what it requires in the attestation clause?              You think the attestation clause cannot be the basis for sanctioning an attorney.              I mean, how can that be if it's too vague.             The attestation clause is designed to ensure that the attorney has performed in an ethical and proper way, I take it.             Isn't that one of its purposes?             I won't take up too much more of your argument, but it just seems to me odd that you can enforce an attestation clause, but not a statute that does the same thing.          I don't understand the principle for that.      You say it's a gateway and it's designed to facilitate the bankruptcy process.                   Well, the government could say the same thing about its statute.              Well, Congress often forgets about the First Amendment, but lawyers don't.             Well, if we assume a proper limited construction -- I know you disagree with that, but if we assume that we can limit the statute properly so that it applies just to unethical conduct, then you can't give that advice to anybody, and the fact that assisted persons is a subclass of that is irrelevant.             Yes, but that doesn't go to your other point that there's a problem in determining the class of persons.                 If it's unethical, you can't give it to anybody.             And the fact that the class of persons is difficult to understand is irrelevant.              I have heard of referring to legislative history when the statute is ambiguous.                 I haven't heard of referring to legislative history to make the statute ambiguous.              Well, A, I suppose you don't have to advertise; or B, if you do, you can say in your bread hypo:     Under the Federal law we have bread, but our bread is -- I don't know -- gluten-free or whatever.    You can use --              You can always add -- add in order to make it non-misleading.
08-1134 +++$+++              Well, what -- what if the creditor is sitting in the courtroom and has actually made arguments and appeared in some other aspects of the case?     Then they come to the student loan and the -- and it's ordered discharged without any hearing, with the creditor sitting there.              The case goes to judgment, there s a final decree of discharge. Can the debtor -- pardon me.             Can the creditor come in 10 years later and say, oh, this is void?             Well, what about -- what about my question?             No, no.   No, no, no.     My hypothetical is there is -- it has commenced. It s a big hearing.     There's lots of issues.              The student loan creditor is there, actually participates in some of the hearings on other issues.              Then, while they -- while they are still there, still represented, the judge says:     Now, I'm going to discharge the student debt; I'm not going to have any hearing.              The creditor does nothing.     Can the creditor come in 10 years later and say this is a void judgment?             Well, my case is just a little different in that the creditor is there in the courtroom represented.             What about my --             What about my question?              I think --              I think that's an astounding -- an astounding conclusion, that there -- that you simply are writing out the doctrine of -- of waiver altogether.             But the idea that they have to have a charade hearing is -- is equally off-putting.             Well, what does the notice of -- the time for a notice of appeal run from?             What does the time for the notice of appeal run from -- the discharge order?             Now -- now, just in the -- in the general run of the bankruptcy, how do you calculate when you have to file your appeal -- from the time of the discharge order?
08-1175 +++$+++              Has the -- has the Florida Supreme Court ever explicitly interpreted -- what is it? Article I, section 8, of the Florida Constitution more expansively than -- and explicitly so -- and explicitly so, than Miranda?             But your case has to be that, if we adopt the Petitioner's petition, it's perfectly fine for every jurisdiction in the country to use this warning, right?             And every jurisdiction in the country can use it, so we can -- we can talk about whether or not it s adequate.              Excuse me.     You think lack of uniformity is a good idea?
08-1191 +++$+++               I'm not sure that it happens in advance of considerable discovery.                    I -- I -- I would agree that the judge can confine discovery to forum non conveniens or for personal jurisdiction, but in -- in these cases one of the things we are really talking about is the burden of discovery.                    That's the cost of litigation.       You know that.
08-1198 +++$+++              And -- and why is it that you say an arbitrator cannot do that, but a judge can?             But are they situated and do they have the same authority as a court would in determining that issue, given the fact that it was remitted to them to decide?             And you would -- would you describe -- would you describe the authority of a court any differently than you've just described the authority of an arbitrator?
08-1200 +++$+++                Well, what about attorneys' fees?
08-1214 +++$+++              Well, but I mean -- if you re coming up and saying, well, we have a principal-agent here, I could understand that, but that's I didn't think the question we are here to decide.             On -- on the tortious interference as to whether or not that's under 301. Sure, agent-principal, I understand that.           But that -- that's a new argument so far as I'm concerned.             Is it your briefs?   Is it part of the question?            Well, but the -- the basic question is -- the Chief Justice began with it -- isn't this -- isn't this a tort action?                 You say, well, it's grounded in contract.             I -- I really have a problem with the word "grounded."              If you say it necessarily implicates or it's entangled, then I could understand that.     But grounded in contract -- we ask what the source of the original obligation is.                 And these parties were not -- or the international was not part of the -- part of the -- part of the contract.         Well, it seems to me the strongest argument you have is that this tortious interference is pre-empted under State law.                So we have a -- a vacuum if we don't accept -- accept your view. Let me ask you this:         My understanding is -- correct me if I am wrong, please -- this Court has not said that they -- that the State law cause of action for interference with contract relations is pre empted.   This Court has not said that.               Am I correct about that?         The circuits have said that, but we haven't said that.             Am I right about that?         No, no.        I m talking -- I m talking specifically that -- interference with advantageous business relations or interfering with an existing contract -- that, we have not addressed in this Court.         But -- but it did not -- it did not include interference with a -- with a contractual relation.    We have not, as a specific holding -- tell me if I m wrong.           I will look at Allis-Chalmers.         It -- it would seem to me that one of your strongest points is that this is pre empted by State law.     If -- if that's not true, then we would be deciding the case based on a premise that is -- is unclear.
08-1224 +++$+++            Well, is part of the statutory scheme that you can be committed to Federal custody for, say, a year and then the State takes it over?            Why would a State want to incur that extra expense if --            -- if the Federal Government is going to do it for them?             Could the Federal Government order a commitment of anyone who's been in Federal custody over the last 10 years?           No, no, no.   That makes your -- my hypo too easy for you. (Laughter.)           So that must be because there is a lack of Federal power.         But the brief -- excuse me.         Well, when I was thinking about your hypothetical, I thought, well, that's a pretty easy commerce power argument.              I -- I notice that in -- in the government's position, you don't argue the Commerce Clause very much, and I -- we ve got Morrison v. Brzonkala looking at you and Printz and so forth. But it -- suppose Congress said there is a class of committable, dangerous sex offenders that are crossing State lines and using interstate facilities, and made those findings.       Would that be sufficient to establish a Federal commitment law?
08-1301 +++$+++               And do -- do they generally require registration even if the offense was committed before the registration act was passed in the State?              So what you re saying is that, even under your interpretation, there is going to be registration in at least one State?
08-1314 +++$+++        But you are saying that once the government gives the manufacturer a choice, then the jury -- the -- the tort system can second-guess it; and that is not consistent with a likely government intent to allow the manufacturers a choice based on the technical advances to that date.       Well, suppose the government says you have a choice and the State of Iowa passes a law and says you don't have a choice.     No frustration of the governmental purpose there?       No, there's just -- just the statutes as I have given them to you.     That there - is there preemption just on the face of the statute?       Of course, your theory is, if I understand your case -- correct me if I am wrong - if GM had installed Type 2, they could have been sued on the theory that Type 1 was better and there would have been no preemption.       But under the theory of your case, that suit could go forward.       Well, then, if the regulation comes out July 1, you say there is a preemption until midnight July 1, but as of July 2 there could be a suit?
08-1322 +++$+++              Well, what s -- what s the authority for the government to enter into the agreement?             I mean, if the statute says there has to be an offset, that's it.             But do the guidelines reflect Justice Breyer's hypothetical?             It seems to me the underlying assumption -- and some of the question would have been put to you by the court -- is that the government has somehow benefited because the money is created to offset the debt.           It really isn't.          It would -- this would be true if an attorney were suing a third party and creating a fund, and the government said, ah, there's the money.           In this case, it's just being paid from one account to the other.                 The government would be better off if there were no suit at all.             It's just paying itself from one account to the other.
08-1332 +++$+++               Well, on that point, do we take it as the law of the case or as a given that it was illegal for I think Arch to turn over the transcripts to the police department?       What do we do with that part of the case?              On remand -- has there been a final judgment issued as to Arch, or is that just being held --               So you have two arguments One, that it's -- there s no reasonable expectation of privacy; even if there were, that this was a reasonable search.             Is that something like the plain view argument?      In search and -- search and --             Well, I'm serious.        In other words, there is, under your view --             -- legitimate grounds to look at the messages, and then once they see it, they don't have to ignore it.             Let me ask you this Suppose the department asks for opinion of legal counsel whether or not transmittal of the transcripts by Arch to the department was a violation of the Act, and the counsel said:    This was a violation of the Act; they had no right to send them to you.                 Would the department then still have had a right to look at the transcripts?             Yes.       Yes.             No, but -- no, my hypothetical is that the -- that there is a legal counsel's opinion that this was in violation of the Act, and let's say the district court said it is in violation of the Act.    Let's say we say it s in violation of the Act.   Is that the end of case?              The department cannot look at the transcripts?               Well, California v. Greenwood was a question of -- of a Fourth Amendment standard that had to be nationwide.                      So you say it's the same -- same thing here?               Well, but Greenwood was in the -- in the context of the exclusionary rule in criminal proceedings.       I certainly think that States -- at least we could make the reasonable argument that States can have different policies with respect to their employees, that have to be respected.
08-1341 +++$+++              Under three.             You answered Justice Alito by saying there are cases in which your inquiry is more searching, more demanding, under four.           It might also be the other way around.     I mean, if you satisfy -- if, under three, you find that it hasn't affected the outcome, then I don't know where you'd go under four.            Yes.             Yes.     There -- there is an overlap.             The point may be tangential, but if both counsel were aware of the date problem, that 2001 was the enactment of the statute, and the jury was later properly instructed, do you think that the government would find it important to introduce the evidence of the pre-enactment conduct, just to set forth scheme, plan, design, purpose, to tell the jury the story?             Do you agree that this is ex post facto, as opposed to a general due process violation?             Well, you -- you agree that there is a violation?
08-1371 +++$+++                 Now, these are fundamental arguments, and I don't want to spend too much time on factual matters because that's frustrating to both the Court and the counsel. But we do have the problem of the stipulation.     The stipulation makes it clear that Democrats and Republicans can both get into the other one's club.    That's the Stipulations 17 and 18 at 220 of the Joint Appendix.     You want to get away from the stipulation by what, according to your reply brief, Hastings said in its answer, but the stipulation supersedes the answer. So if both counsel could just address for a moment:   What is the case that we have here?                    You have different views on what case is before us.             You can do that, but you -- it's a much different case if Hastings treats the CLS differently than it treats the Democratic and Republican Clubs.   That s a much different -- frankly, it's a much easier case for you.       But it's -- it's frustrating for us not to know what kind of case we have in front of us.             Of course, that was not a religion case.    Your argument at its most fundamental level is that religious organizations are different because religion is all about belief.                    But at that point don't we also have a tradition of separation?                    That's the whole reason why church and state for many purposes are kept separate, so that States are not implicated with religious beliefs. And it -- it -- it seems to me we have to consider that when we are considering your argument. Now, you can cite Rosenberger, but -- but I think this is different from that.             I had thought that an important part of the case, of your case, is that belief is inherent to the idea of religious expression and must be protected.    But if the protection causes problems within the school for other policies, then doesn't the separation policy come into play?                 That's -- that's what I'm asking.             But that's different from Cantwell.     Cantwell is where the Jehovah's Witness plays the record on the -- on the street.                 And -- and --             No.      No.    And Cantwell said that belief is central to -- to religions and that people would disagree.        But that's precisely why Hastings might argue to us that -- that this is inconsistent with their idea of what this forum is.                      And if -- will you just address that, please?
08-1394 +++$+++ 
08-1402 +++$+++            But -- but I suppose the thrust of Justice Stevens's question was that if you have a very small population that we are concerned with, then the disparity can be very substantial, especially if you use the comparative disparity.           And I think -- at least, I was interested in that aspect of his question.             Yes, but we have a half hour.   I d kind of like to know how to --         Are you -- are you saying that systematic exclusion -- and we are assuming good faith, no intent to discriminate --         -- that systematic exclusion is always proven or disproven by statistics?         Well --         And I ll -- I ll allow you to answer, of course, but --         If not, how do we show systematic exclusion?      Again, assuming good faith, no intent to discriminate.          Let me get that.         If -- if a procedure routinely results in statistical underrepresentation that is significant, is that not a clear showing of systematic exclusion?          Well, yes -- no, that's -- it's a hypothetical.          Routinely results in significant underrepresentation, then that is automatically systematic exclusion?          I mean, isn't the -- I'm trying to think about the third prong of -- of --          -- of Duren.    Isn't -- if it's routine and it's predictable and it's constant, isn't that always due to systematic exclusion?
08-1423 +++$+++        Exactly, and that's what it does under my theory, because there has been no first sale.
08-1438 +++$+++        The government is going to tell us that the standard for waiver with respect to the Federal Government is different from the standard with respect to the State.     Do you -- I think that's what they are going to tell us.     Do you agree with that?       But it seems to me that the States are in need of special protection.     With - with the Congress, if it's a Federal immunity, the Congress can always -- always change its law.       That just can't happen with the State.       It's the suggestion of the opposite that -- that I am trying -- I am trying to explore. You have your white light on.       But we are talking about general principles of interpretation and the proposition that we are suggesting is that the State surely should be entitled to the same dignity, the same protection against suits as the Federal Government, and you suggest just the opposite.       And it seems to me that's contrary to standard principles of the Federal -- of protecting the Federal balance.       But it's -- but it's only because they accept the funds at all that the Spending -- that the Spending Clause is even operative.
08-1448 +++$+++        Let me just make one comment on that point.     It seems to me all or at least the great majority of the questions today are designed to probe whether or not this statute is vague.     And you say the beauty of the statute is that it utilizes the categories that have been used in the obscenity area and that -- that there's an obvious parallel there. The problem is, is that for generations there has been a societal consensus about sexual material.     Sex and violence have both been around a long time, but there's a societal consensus about what's offensive for sexual material, and there are judicial discussions on it.     Now, those judicial discussions are not precise.     You could have had the same questions today with reference to an obscenity statute, and we have -- we have said that with reference to obscenity, there are certain -- that there are certain materials that are not protected.     Those rules are not precise at the margins, and some would say not precise in a more significant degree as well. But you're asking us to go into an entirely new area where there are no consensus, no judicial opinions.     And this is -- and this indicates to me the statute might be vague, and I just thought you'd like to know that -- that reaction. (Laughter.)       I can see your white light's on.     But even if we get past what I think are difficult questions about vagueness and how to interpret this law, isn't there a less restrictive alternative with the -- a V-chip?       Yes.       So V-chips don't work.
08-1457 +++$+++                Well, just on this same point before Justice Breyer I think moves to another point.   The statute does use the word "quorum" twice and, as Justice Ginsburg has pointed out, except that two members -- in its last phrase it uses the word "quorum" twice:     "Except that two members shall constitute a quorum."        It doesn't say two members may act.               It says shall constitute a quorum."             But that brings you back to Justice Breyer's hypothetical.                   There's five members on the board.     Clearly they can delegate under the statute.   Now there are only four members.                  Something happens to the fifth.        Under your theory, the entity that originally delegated no longer exists and therefore the group, the entity that received the delegation of powers, must cease, must cease to act.             If the quorum of three that authorized two to act disappears and that means the principal is no longer there, so the agent can't exercise the authority, why isn't it the same when five become four?
08-146 +++$+++                 Well, of course, one of --                One of the things you're going to say is that, with all due respect, Justice Breyer, this conflates the merits with the jurisdictional problem, which is exactly the mistake that the court of appeals made.                Is that your theory of the case?
08-1470 +++$+++              Is there a clearly established rule that in all of the circumstances of the case, we can find that there is coercion, time being one aspect of those circumstances?             And so that is a clearly established rule, and then it's a question whether 2 and a half, 3 and a half, 4 and a half suffices.                -          But your -- your position is that if -- same facts, but it's 10 hours instead of 2 and a half, is that a closer case, at least?                 For --              And does that show that that the circumstances are coercive, so that even if there were a waiver it would be --               You re saying there s a difference between a waiver and a failure to assert?              So do you read -- yes.    So do you read Miranda as saying that there cannot be questioning unless there is a waiver?              Then we'll go on to -- or do you --              Okay, you do not.              So are you going to go on -- because this is right where you are.              Are you going to go on to say that, in the Miranda context, the failure to assert can -- can suffice to allow the questioning to proceed?              But why isn't that language that you quote a negative inference that there must be a waiver?              So there s a difference between waiving at the time of the interrogation and then waiving it at the time of trial?              I don't understand that.         But I just want to make sure where we are.         You re not -- you re conceding, it seems to me, that there must be a waiver?               I just don't understand -- why -- why can't --               We have to guide the police.               Why don't we tell the police, there must be a waiver before you can continue to interrogate?               I don't know why you didn't answer Justice Stevens's questions by saying, Justice Stevens, I don't care about waiver.                 There was no -- there was no assertion of the right. But you re not saying that.                You are admitting there has to be a waiver.                But there also assumes there has to be a waiver.              I -- I have to say that -- page 475 and 476, particularly, of Miranda do talk in terms of a -- of a waiver.        Did -- are there -- did the subsequent cases indicate an articulation of that view that s closer to your position? REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF B. ERIC RESTUCCIA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
08-1498 +++$+++              Well, could the government, I assume -- I assume you will say "yes" -- could the government forbid any NGO or other organization or person from giving tsunami aid to one of these organizations, from giving them money?             Could they -- could the government prohibit that?             Okay.    Let's assume the government could prohibit that.            Then the next question is:   Could the government prohibit speech instructing the terrorist organization how to get the tsunami aid?              Brandenburg?              But -- but if you get tsunami money, that frees up your other assets for terrorist money.   So why can't the government forbid teaching how to get that money?              Then what's the test? Is it -- you say it's not Brandenburg?             Well, suppose it's a ban just for travel to meet with terrorist organizations, Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical.             But what about the -- what about the hypothetical?             It's what the Chief Justice says:     In any context, support ultimately will inure to the benefit of a terrorist organization, and we have a governmental interest in not allowing that.              No, no.   No, no.   I thought that he was -- he wants to meet with the people.                The New York Times didn't meet with Hamas to tell them how great their editorial was.             But it didn t -- it was not a statute which involves banning financial or other tangible support, and page 17 of your brief made -- this is a difficult case for me.       And the second paragraph, page 17, you say:     "The narrow focus of plaintiffs' claims in this Court means that the case does not involve the propriety of banning financial or other tangible support."          Then you say involve speech advocating or teaching criminal or violent activity." But it does involve speech, let's say arguendo, that is tantamount to material support.             Suppose the speech is tantamount to material support in that it legitimizes, encourages, or strengthens the organization.             And this is support.   It's different.              But there wasn't a statute on the books that prohibited material support --              And here there is, and this is in aid of that prohibition.                We have to be conscious of the white light.     I have just one -- one question. The old equity rule was that you don't enjoin a criminal statute; you wait until something happens.     And the reason is then we have specific facts. And if we said that here, you would say, oh, you re chilling speech. What's your best case in the precedents of this Court for our entertaining an challenge that -- this is not really -- we usually talk about as-applied after the fact.     Coates, there was a conviction.             What's your -- what's your best case?                I -- I agree.   And that was as applied to a conviction.                I just haven't seen an as-applied challenge on declaratory relief.               The government doesn't seem to object to that procedure.
08-1521 +++$+++                 No, I understood the Chief Justice's question -- maybe I misunderstood it, but my understanding of the question as important is this: Under incorporation by reference, the States are bound by the rights in all -- with all of the refinements and sophistication with which we interpret them for the Federal Government.     It's the same.             You don't just apply the core of the right.             You apply all of the right as it is elaborated by the cases. Is -- is that same consequence -- does that same consequence follow if we adopt the privileges and immunities interpretation that you are urging upon us?              Counsel, at the -- at the very outset of your argument, Justice Sotomayor asked the question which, as I understood it, essentially said what are examples of privileges and immunities that are being denied by the States that -- which denial would be remedied by following your proposal to overrule the Slaughter-House case? And let's leave the Second Amendment out. Let's assume the Second Amendment is a wash; it's either going to be incorporated or not going to be incorporated the same -- to the same extent under either the Privileges or Immunities Clause or the Due Process Clause.               Leaving the Due Process -- the Second Amendment out of it, what privileges and immunities are now being denied citizens of -- of the United States?             What are examples of those?   The jury trial in civil cases?             And grand jury.     What else?             Well, I'm -- we re using up your time.    But --             -- do you want me to leave the bench thinking grand jury indictment and civil trial and jury case -- that's it.          There's no other -- what are these other unenumerated rights?
08-1529 +++$+++               But it seems to me that, quite apart from the Westfall Act, there s a more -- more basic answer that you would make to Justice Sotomayor's question.      And that is, because the nature of immunity clauses are to make the employees secure against unforeseen causes of action as well as foreseen. I think that's a principled answer you could make. If I made that answer, do you have authority I could cite for that proposition?              Okay.             If we limit it, then Congress would have to reenact a statute every time there was some new cause of action?                Well, that would bar a later Bivens claim.     I assume you could bring a Bivens action first, and the bar provision would not apply, assuming you can bring the Bivens claim.            Yes.
08-1553 +++$+++                I have one question.     I know that it s -- your white light is on.                 Can I assume that whether we rule for Petitioners or Respondents in this case, the shipping world, the cargo world, will immediately adjust to our decision?                It's not going to be a problem.   There are insurers, there are freight forwarders, there are form contracts.                People will know exactly what to do.     They will adjust in 1 week to what we do.   Am I right about that?          Or can you say that if we adopt the Respondents  position, it will be disruptive to the shipping trade and so forth?
08-1555 +++$+++                Counsel, I -- I want to just say that I have one problem with the case at the outset. And I don't mean to interrupt the organization of your argument.   You might want to address it later.                 And it s a question that goes to the other counsel, too. I'm having difficulty seeing how the issues as presented in the brief really resolve very much. Let's assume -- I know this is not your position.                  Let's assume the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act grants immunity to the state for this conduct and for a then-serving official who is its agent and for a former agent.   Let's assume there is -- there is immunity.                Why isn't it just repealed, overridden, by the later enactment of the Torture Victims Protection Act? I just don't see the issue structured that way in the briefs, and I'm puzzled by it.                But I say that at the outset, and I really didn't mean to interrupt your -- your good introduction.              What -- what authority do you have for that?              What case authority do you have for that proposition?             It's like a -- it's like a clear statement rule?             Of course, that -- again, the Torture Victim Protection Act says  an individual who, under actual or apparent authority, or under color of law of any foreign nation, subjects an individual to torture. Why isn't that a clear statement?              And then I ll get off this hobby horse, and you can get back to talking about the FSIA.             Well, and then I -- I had thought -- again, correct me if I am wrong -- that, ultimately, in this case, whether or not within the issues here present -- ultimately, you have two arguments. One is that it's just implicit, inherent, necessary for the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that agents be covered; otherwise it won't work. The other -- I take it you have a backup position that even if that's wrong, that under generally accepted principles of international law, that agents still have immunity.   Or am I wrong about that?             I had thought when I read the House of Lords opinion in Jones and they talked about the statute, that they took your position, this first position, that the Act just won't work unless there s an agent -- immunity for the agent.               But I take it that even if we reject that position, you still have a fallback position in the -- in the -- in further proceedings on remand?
08-1569 +++$+++               Can you give us the page?
08-192 +++$+++              Well, suppose you had the girlfriend phone and say:          My boyfriend needs drugs; meet him at the corner of 3rd and Main.                 What crime does the girlfriend commit?       It seems to me that it's pretty clear that she's under 843(b) facilitating.             It seems to me that she may then have committed a felony, and yet it seems to me that her culpability is certainly no -- no greater, if you're talking about your -- the polity of your statute, than the man who uses the drugs.                Maybe Justice Ginsburg would like some further illustration, but I thought that that was one illustration in answer to her question.             Well, but that was the same word.   That was "transporting" in both instances. Here you have "purchase," one, "facilitating" with a telephone, two.   That's different.             Well, I'll think about it, but I think Gebardi does involve one statute, one act, transportation.   This involves two.                    The underlying felony is the purchase or possession, and the second statute is use of the telephone.               So I don't -- I'll think about it, but I don't think Gebardi works.              If the government were to prevail here, I assume that it would then as a result have a much larger, more expansive discretion in charging and plea bargaining and -- and et cetera. Other than the rule of lenity, is there anything in our cases that indicates that we should be cautious about giving the government that authority so that that's an aid in our interpretation or is that just all within the rule of lenity?                 Other than --                 No background principles either way on granting the prosecutors vast discretion in charging --                 -- as it applies to statutory interpretation?
08-205 +++$+++                 I -- I agree -- I agree that Buckley made the distinction between contributions and expenditures, and it seems to me that the government's argument necessarily wants to water down that distinction.     But in response or just in furtherance of Justice Breyer's point, you have two cases, one in which an officeholder goes to a corporation and says:        Will you please give me money? They say:   We can't do that. The other is in which a corporation takes out an ad for the -- for the candidate, which relieves that candidate of the responsibility of -- of substantial television coverage.                Isn't that about the same?                And I -- and I think Buckley says no.                But, as a practical matter, is that always true?             Well, with reference to any incongruities that might flow from our adopting your position, are you aware of any case in this Court which says that we must refrain from addressing an unconstitutional aspect of the statute because the statute is flawed in some other respects as well?
08-214 +++$+++                But do you read Vaughan v. Atkinson as necessarily implying punitive damages would be inappropriate?      I can't quite find the negative that you want me to find, I think, in Atkinson.                        True, they didn't talk about punitive damages.                        They said damages are appropriate, and attorneys' fees in this case, which is what the district court gave, we are going to affirm it.     But there's nothing there that said punitive damages are inappropriate.                But that -- but that was a common law wrongful death action, correct, Miles?             It was not admiralty maintenance and cure.              As I read your reply brief -- and please correct me if it's a misimpression -- you didn't dispute the fact that punitive damages were available historically for the shipowner's wrongful refusal to provide maintenance and cure, or am I wrong about that?             And what about English admiralty, under the English precedents?             Of course, in Miles -- again, we're coming back -- was wrongful death, not maintenance and cure.              But I just -- and you can go ahead and answer that question without my interrupting.     But my assumption from reading the amicus briefs in this case is that punitive damages were awarded in some maintenance and cure cases (a) as simply part of the overall award -- they weren't separated out, but it was part of the measure -- and (b) that some American courts, American judges, including noted admiralty judges, awarded in some cases punitive damages in maintenance and cure before the modern cases Moragne and so forth -- and Miles -- that you're talking about. Is that incorrect?                 I'm talking pre-Miles. I'm talking pre-Miles.             Is that a separate cause of action?   Or is it just part of the maintenance and cure act?
08-22 +++$+++               Well, then, my -- my question in this case is this:               In your petition for certiorari you said that, well, by the time you came here you would have a standard for us that we can work with.   You know, all of us know, that a ruling in your favor means that law and motion practice will -- could -- could change drastically in States all across the country.   Disqualification for bias will now become a -- a part of the pretrial process, and I'm asking you what your standard is. Your standard is an unacceptable risk of impropriety or perception of bias, but I -- I need some more specific standards within which to fit this case. You give a general standard, and then we hear about the amount of the contribution.             We hear about the fact that it was a contested election, et cetera.               But your -- your standard of -- of impropriety doesn't, it seems to me, give sufficient -- or "unacceptable risk of bias" doesn't give sufficient guidance to the courts to implement this rule unless it's just -- it's just going to be one case. Now, I know the law evolves on a case-by-case system.                I understand that, but it doesn't seem to me that the standard you offer us is specific enough.              I want you to articulate some substandards that have -- that are general in nature, that apply to this case, substandards that are more specific than the probability of bias.
08-240 +++$+++             Is -- is leaving the premises the sine quo non of a termination?            But aren't there -- aren't there some operators that own their own premises?            So only one of the three would suffice in your view?          Just --          Just testing your view, suppose there are two franchisees, and in each case the oil company reduces the amount they're paying for the gas.   One franchisee can't afford it, leaves, quits -- termination.    The other franchisee has a considerable amount of savings, and he protests, but he stays in business.    Different result?          No, no.        In my first, he ceases to operate and he moves out of the premises.            If the government comes up here, as I think they will in a few minutes, and tells us that there is such a thing as constructive termination, do you know what hypothetical they give us to illustrate how that would work?                 I mean, it's their argument, but I'm curious.          I will be curious to know how you would respond to that.            In other words, there is a small universe of cases in which there is a constructive termination without leaving the premises, without severing the fuel, et cetera.            I just don't know what they're going to -- how you would respond to that?         But then you'd just have a magic words test.
08-267 +++$+++              Well, part -- part of independence is the assurance that the court has the ability to do justice in the case before it, and I think the purpose of coram nobis or coram vobis is to protect the integrity of the court, and that's all this court is asking.   So that's quite consistent with what you've just said.              Well, but -- but you're shifting ground a little bit.              The tenor of the questions from Justice Alito and Justice Ginsburg really is to the effect:    Does coram nobis require an independent source of -- of jurisdiction?                And I should think not.              The whole idea of coram nobis is to protect the integrity of the jurisdiction the court already has.              I -- I acknowledge that. But there is a source of jurisdiction here.               Coram nobis is to ensure the accurate exercise of jurisdiction that the court has earlier asserted.
08-289 +++$+++              Could you tell me what your submission is with respect to the error you see in the findings and the order made after the eight-day hearing?    First, are you saying that after No Child Left Behind that the duty of the State with respect to educating the students who have a different language was less onerous?             All right.        And are you saying that because of that methodology any remedy based on funding is no longer appropriate?             If we could -- is it valid as to Nogales, if we focus just on Nogales?             Are you saying -- are you saying that the order the district court gave with respect just to Nogales --               -- is inappropriate because it used a funding remedy or a funding measure of compliance when it should have used blank, and then fill in the blank?              It seems to me, Mr. Starr, based on this last argument, that it actually is in your favor if the order of the court as to one district automatically requires additional expenditure for every other district, that is simply one more measure that the Court should use in finding an alternate remedy.
08-295 +++$+++                 Can you answer my question?                But why does the bankruptcy court have jurisdiction to enjoin third party actions against some creditor of the estate?                But if those actions won't affect the estate at all, I just don't understand sort of the basic theory, and I don't really understand the theory of the plaintiffs' cases, either.                  I don't understand -- I can't figure out what anybody expects to collect from Travelers for what they did.                  The fact that they defended cases certainly was proper for them as an insurance company.      This is mysterious case to me.             But none of whom would be affected if these suits go forward, as I understand it. I'm missing something very important, I think.               Why isn't it harmless error?              Well, but it seems to me you --
08-304 +++$+++              Can you tell me just as a practical matter, suppose -- suppose the county says, you know, we found out that we were defrauded by this contractor, and it sues the contractor.                But its suit doesn't cover really all of the damages, only half of it.   Can a qui tam action then be commenced for the portion that the county isn't seeking?                 I mean, how does that work?             Which there would be if there's a complaint filed by the county --             -- against the contractor.             Depends on the identity of the claim?             And -- and suppose in their race to the courthouse, the qui tam plaintiff files on Monday and the county files on Tuesday?
08-305 +++$+++              What about before?           The whole point is that under the words of the statute as you interpret it, there is a condition predicate that has to be satisfied.     So, to say that -- to answer by saying, well, that assumes they won't obey the hearing officer, what about before the hearing even takes place?               Well, but it's not that hypothetical when -- there are two prongs.                  Number one, the school has to agree first with the diagnosis, which in this case they didn't even do that.                  They had a good faith disagreement.      Second, they have to have an adequate IEP.   So there are two conditions.              The -- the problem that the government and the parents have is they have to give some work to (ii).      Under -- under their view (ii) doesn't seem to do much work. And the problem with your position is that it seems in a way formalistic and in some cases to encourage intransigence.           If we adopted a presumption that the school district's diagnosis was correct and a presumption that it's -- if -- if there was a diagnosis of disability, that its individual education program was adequate, that would, it seems to me, not be all you wanted, but would ameliorate the position of the school district.     Would we have authority, do you think, to adopt such a presumption?              Well, this -- this would be a clear and convincing evidence presumption that the -- that the IEP is -- that the school district designs is right, that its diagnosis is right.                      That's not all you -- that's not all you would be asking for.                 But would we have authority to do that if we were to reject your interpretation of the statute?
08-310 +++$+++               It's not often that we have disagreements as to the basic facts.                The red brief says that the tax in question constitutes 11 percent of the tax base, and you talk about that in the reply brief.   Can you spend just a little bit of time at the outset telling us your views of this tax?                And although it's the Respondent's statement and not yours, do you think 11 percent of the tax base means 11 percent of what's collected under this tax or under all taxes imposed by City of Valdez?               In which case, that seems really quite irrelevant.              As you understand it, with reference to the tax base referred to in the red brief at page 14 where it says it's 11 percent of the tax base, is that tax base all city-imposed?
08-322 +++$+++               Well, to the extent we have some latitude in construing the Act, certainly it would be a relevant factor if we concluded that it's just unworkable or impractical to have an uncovered jurisdiction within a county which is a covered jurisdiction.     They would have competing election days, competing election formulae.              And it would seem to me that that just makes compliance with the Act much more difficult.               If we find that you're not covered by the bailout provision, that only the county is, do you really then have standing to proceed to question the workability of the bailout procedures?                   I -- I suppose that would be a threshold argument for you to question the validity of the Act.             Well, Justice Breyer -- Justice Breyer did refer you to some other more current statistics, submissions, Title V suits, and so forth. You might want to address those.               And in that context, was there any control data to compare preclearance rates or preclearance events in colored -- in covered jurisdictions as opposed to uncovered jurisdictions?               And that -- that's part of the showing, it seems to me, that the Congress has to make, that these States that are now covered and that were covered are markedly different from the noncovered jurisdictions.   Was there anything in the record before the Congress or the district court to address that point?
08-351 +++$+++  
08-441 +++$+++               Well, but -- I just want -- you said that the Court has never imposed a burden of proof-shifting requirement absent a directive from Congress?     Are you --              Or maybe -- maybe I misheard.              All right.              But your -- your position, you rest heavily on the argument, I think, but there is no textual support in the ADEA for a heightened evidence requirement in order to shift the burden of proof.                       But isn't it true there is no textural support for shifting the burden of proof at all?           I mean, I don't see how you can -- can convince us of the first proposition without confronting the second.             Well, of course, affirmative defenses, usually the burden of persuasion is on the party asserting the affirmative defense.                Well, in -- in response further to Justice Ginsburg's question, and I think Justice Souter's, too, is there -- are there any tactical difficulties or strategic difficulties that counsel face if they don't quite know which way the burden is going to shift before trial:                    The -- the number of witnesses you have waiting in the hallway or -- this -- this would be after summary judgment.
08-453 +++$+++                But if OCC thought there might be such a problem, couldn't it act in advance to avoid the risk that Justice Breyer's question explains?
08-472 +++$+++               Well, but that -- that's because -- that's because you assume the act is going to be valid.   You could have come here and said:            This is such an important case Congress is taking action, and therefore, you should hear our standing argument to avoid the necessity of the Legislative Branch having to come in.    You could have said that.
08-479 +++$+++               Was she subject to a civil suit by the plaintiff in this case?              Yes.                 Do you know whether or not in the Ninth Circuit in border search cases a body cavity search can be conducted without a warrant?                  I thought a warrant was required under the Ninth Circuit rule.   I could ask the government.             You -- you criticized the Ninth Circuit in your brief for having a sliding scale standard, which is a bad thing in your view.                    But it seems to me that your standard comes close to that.                      You call yours a differential level standard or something like that?
08-495 +++$+++                Under the time-honored --               Under the time-honored approach, if the jury verdict necessarily -- or not necessarily, but did in fact refer to the amount involved and it was over $10,000, would that be part of the time-honored approach and then the statute would be fulfilled?              Well, in that connection, at some point in the argument -- and you may be a little early because you're talking about the statute -- I'd like to know either anecdotally from your experience or -- or because it's written somewhere, how often do juries give special verdicts?            It actually applies in the second case we're to hear as well.                 And has that changed in the light of -- of Apprendi?                 In -- in my experience, we just didn't know many of the features of the crime from -- from the jury verdict, and I just would like to know if that's changed in this day and age.              But you may reach that after you've talked about the statute.              But I can see that if there are multiple defendants in the case, some of the defendants might say that this is unnecessary, it's inflammatory.               But all that just underscores the fact that --                 I frankly couldn't understand the government's concession on that point.                         I thought the -- the offense on illegal entry was to enter illegally after you've been deported.                       It's a -- there's a defense if the original deportation was flawed?                 I don't understand that.              I see.          I see.
08-5274 +++$+++                  You have to use or carry the firearm before -- before section 2 even applies.                 That's different.
08-538 +++$+++              Well, they don't always liquidate the asset, if they -- if they elect -- if everybody agrees that they get the asset itself, they don't have to sell it.             What -- what -- what you are doing there, you -- you argue that ambiguities are construed against the person that made the form.              I think that's a little harsh when the trustee is a repeat player and knows -- and knows the rules.             On the other hand, I think what you have going for you is that the trustee is going to always be at risk that the asset is worth more than what's listed and is going to have to take steps to value it in every -- every case. In this case, it's -- it's clear that she  - she knew that the Honda was worth more.              She was only claiming $2,900, $2,950 on a Honda.             And -- and if you take that together with -- and -- and the kitchen equipment comes next, and she -- and the value is the same in each column.     So that indicates that she was claiming the full value.                Is it also true  - tell me about this:     One of my concerns is that the trustees simply don't have time in every case to have a creditors  meeting and go through every asset. If they did, then Justice Breyer's suggestion, where they'd sit down and talk about all this stuff, would be -- would be fine.              Am I right or wrong in making that empirical assumption?              I mean, I just don't know.              He has to.    Otherwise, he is at risk that it might be worth $400,000 or whatever.
08-586 +++$+++               Is Harris a fiduciary in the same sense as a corporate officer and a corporate director?   Or does his fiduciary duty differ?           Is it higher or lower, same with a guardian, same with a trustee? I mean, the word "fiduciary" -- does fiduciary imply different standards, depending on what kind of fiduciary you are?              Well, would the test for compensation in this case be the same as any director or any officer of a corporation?              I just want to know, is the fiduciary duties the same?            Is the fiduciary standard the same, without getting into how its applied? Is the fiduciary standard the same for Jones, for a guardian, for a trustee, for a corporate officer or a corporate director, always the same?                You said that Congress used "fiduciary" in a special sense.                    Then -- then, I have to conclude that your earlier answer is confusing for me, because I thought you were going to tell us that this investment adviser has the same fiduciary standard that officers and directors of corporations have.                    Then you say that Congress used it in this special sense.                       So that doesn't quite square.                 Do you think Congress used the term "fiduciary" in a very special sense here?                 I will just tell you the problem I'm having with the case. If I look at a standard that the fees must be reasonable and I compare that with what a fiduciary would do, I thought a fiduciary has the highest possible duty.                 But apparently the submission is the fiduciary has a lower duty, a lesser duty than to charge a reasonable fee.                   I just find that quite a puzzling use of the word "fiduciary." Now, if Congress uses it as a term of art or in some special sense, fine.              But it seems to me an odd use of the term "fiduciary."           I don't know why Congress didn't use some other word.              How is the -- how is the standard you've just described different from a standard of reasonableness?              Well, I would be very surprised if "reasonableness" always meant one -- one figure.   It could mean a range.
08-598 +++$+++               I don't want to take you too far outside the record, and you can come back to it, but I -- I just have this question.                     Suppose that in a jury case the jury -- pre-Atkins, the jury says, we find that the defendant has a 65 IQ, but that in light of the heinous nature of the offense, this is not a mitigating factor, and that he should be sentenced to death. In a subsequent Atkins proceeding, can the jury finding with reference to the IQ be conclusive?              Or must that be reopened?              It can -- can be reopened?              But could the -- could the defendant argue the -- that -- the accused argue that at least as to the finding of the 65 IQ, that that is a given.             And that that issue, i.e., the level of IQ, cannot be relitigated, the number?               Let -- let me just ask, does the State have any position now as to his IQ?              Will the State -- would you say the State has an independent obligation to -- to ensure itself that he has an adequate IQ?
08-6 +++$+++              Can you give me some idea of how many cases there are in, say, the last 10 years in which in State postconviction proceedings the convicted prisoner has asked for DNA evidence?               Three?          300?             Do you think there's a constitutional right to establish innocence in some cases where there is new and -- evidence that could not previously have been discovered, that has a high likelihood of exonerating?             I'm asking for your position.              Would you resist that request?              You cannot confirm that you would acquiesce and recommend that he get the DNA sample under those conditions?                Would there be instances when you, as the Attorney General of Alaska, would waive procedural defaults, in order to determine if there was guilt or innocence in a case where DNA conclusively proved it, simply pause of your interest in not confining innocent people?                All you're can say in answer to my question is, to your particular approach to your duties here, is that that's conceivable?
08-604 +++$+++  
08-6261 +++$+++                 In criminal cases, because I -- I -- correct me if I am wrong, but my -- my recollection is that orders to show cause for contempt in the civil -- on the civil side occur frequently, and that allows a jail sentence in California I think of 5 days -- and this is civil, because it's coercive.                 Now, you are talking about something different, I take it?              Have -- have we had cases that said that Federal separation of powers principles are binding on territorial governments, for instance?             And what is your position and can you advise us -- I know it's not in your case - if there is a plea bargain in the Southern District of New York, does it -- does bind, do you think, the prosecutor in the Eastern District?                       What is your view of that proposition?        I know it's not part of this case.
08-645 +++$+++               Well, suppose you -- suppose you have a --              But what if -- what if you d have a country in which ne exeat orders are routinely imposed in every custody case?              Then it's almost like your statutory case here.              What does that have to do with custody?              It seems -- excuse me,              -- but I'll just finish my own question.              It seems to me that what you are saying is that, in some countries, there -- there is a presumption that there is always custody in the party -- in both parties.            As long as you brought that up, I was just going to ask:              Should -- if you prevail in this case, should there be a remand to see if that section applies?            Well, you re saying -- I know the white light's on -- but you are saying that every case that involves the Chilean government, the convention here is applicable, requiring return?          Do you -- do you agree that every case originating in Chile must come out this way, so that there is a return required?          But that seems to me remote from the concept of custody that the convention has in mind.
08-651 +++$+++               If we were in -- if we were in the contract, civil contract situation, and there s a mistake, the usual rule -- Restatement of Contracts -- is that the -- the question is whether or not it's reasonable to have the party who made the mistake bear the risk. Suppose we just had an instruction, Rule 11 -- I recognize this is a State case -- but we had a Rule 11 instruction, which said the only thing the court is going to inquire about and the only thing that was of relevance to your plea are criminal consequences. You take the risk of any misadvice, any misunderstanding, with respect to collateral conduct. That's your risk, and it's part of the guilty plea.              If we said that, would that foreclose this kind of argument in your case?              Well, then there s no way the government or the court can protect itself against the -- these consequences, and there are any number of them.   Suppose he doesn't advise that there s going to be civil liability in tort once he pleads guilty, because then that's a fact that's concluded and it's just a question of damages.          And as Justice Scalia indicated, there are many, many instances. I just see no way for the courts to protect themselves against -- against this.               And -- and if the client, or the accused, is told that he accepts these risks, he can say, well, you know, there may be some risks I don't know about, I'll go to trial.               He just accepts the risks.             Well, do you think it would be wrong for a district court to say, now, I want to be very careful, and I'm going to add -- let's take Rule 11 as the standard.        It's a Federal case.        I'm going to add to Rule 11.        I'm going to say, in addition to the Rule 11 questions that you've all answered, I want to make sure:     Have you been advised about immigration?     Have you been advised about other collateral consequences? Do you think that would be error for the  - or inappropriate for a district judge to do?             The -- the judge would not be exceeding his -- his commission, his authority, to determine just whether this is knowing and voluntary in the sense of knowing -- knowing the criminal consequences of -- I mean, in the criminal system itself?               But it seems to me a careful district judge would have to do this if you prevail.
08-660 +++$+++  
08-661 +++$+++            Changes in the -- in the rule apply?     They make a change to make it -- give the passer more protection, but there's -- this really hurts certain teams, which mostly run, and so -- rule of reason?           Well, how -- you know the litigation system.        How do we know?              Well, my -- my hypothetical:     Two or three teams which aren't particularly popular in the league are hurt by the rule change.    And --              And notice, there s -- that the owners sit around the room, they are liable for a conspiracy.     I mean, this is serious stuff. Triple damages. I don't -- and my question, really, was the same as Justice Ginsburg s.            Can you give us a zone where we are sure a rule of reason inquiry will be -- would be inappropriate?        We can take care of it on summary judgment.     Because if you don't have some sort of section 1 carve-out for joint action, then -- then everything is under the rule of reason.            Well, but it seems to me what we are doing is exploring the consequences of completely discarding the unitary theory.            And so -- and the earlier questions, it seemed to me, were helpful.               The Saturday/Sunday scheduling issue, it seems to me, pretty clearly on its face does limit competition. You -- you have one day instead of two days. Then Justice Stevens said:               Suppose it makes them better players because they are rested and so they can perform better.        I take it that was the purpose of the question.        And I -- I still don't get any answers.     I don't know where we are with this.            And -- and it's a difficult area, but I d like -- and -- but I d like some guidance.
08-67 +++$+++                But in a sense that's Justice Scalia's point, that the jury has in effect told us nothing, and in effect that argument hurts your case in one sense.   Hung counts are meaningless.
08-674 +++$+++              Am I correct -- and maybe this is more proper for the government than for you, or for all the parties.     I take it no one questions the propriety, the lawfulness, of the FERC determination to convene the settlement process?             There's no argument that this was an improper, an unlawful process?             Can I --             Were the -- are the Respondents correct and was the court of appeals correct in calling this a presumption?             In -- in calling the rate that was agreed upon a presumption of a reasonable rate?             So you don't quarrel with that word --             -- or would you quarrel with that characterization?              Does anything in your argument turn on the fact that the Respondents were parties to the settlement process?
08-678 +++$+++  
08-680 +++$+++               Is the rationale for the break in custody that there is a likelihood of non-coercion?   Is that the reason that you offer for the rule?             All right.          But this person was in custody in the sense he was in prison and the brief said, oh, he was released to the general population.    But the possibilities for coercion or pressure are very substantial in the prison.                     The warden comes in and says:    Oh, your cell doesn't have a window. I mine, there's countless way in which a prisoner in the general prison population would consider that he is -- that there has been no break in custody.                     I think that's a very difficult rule that you are proposing.             You join counsel for the State in just not wanting to argue for a time rule, which seems to me the only thing that would work.             That's become apparent, and I'm indicating that I think the time rule might have some benefits.             But the Speedy Trial Act, with many exceptions, requires that you go to trial within 70 days.    Would that be a benchmark?
08-681 +++$+++                 Did the government -- I thought the government said that an empirical database would be the Ninth Circuit, which has the more generous rule.              My understanding is that stays are granted in a very high percentage of those cases.     I would be curious to know, A, the percentage of the cases in which it's granted; and B, the percentage of those cases that are ultimately decided in favor of the government?              Well, is it true that there are more petitions filed in the courts with the more generous standards?              Just to refresh my recollection, what -- what is the major difference between the standards that -- or the findings that the judge must make, (a) to grant a preliminary injunction and (b) to grant a stay?              My -- my concern is that I sense in this statute a congressional concern that stays are too frequently granted.             And one thing we could do, if we were to accept your view of the statute, is to say:    And you must be very careful. Well, the courts don't listen to that very much.    And short of granting the -- accepting the government's position, I don't know what you could do if there were a -- a submission and understanding that stays were being granted routinely and too frequently.              Yes, but you still have a differential on the Friday to Monday night hypothetical. You wouldn't apply, or would you, the same standard that you would apply on Monday for the next -- on Monday for the next year and a half?              Because you have the same problem under your standard as the government does under its.              You think that if you do not prevail, and we say clear and convincing evidence is the standard, that courts are not entitled to consider equity?              About your position, is it your contention that if we grant -- if we determine clear and convincing is the standard, that equities are not relevant to that calculus?
08-6925 +++$+++              I -- I don't want to waste too much of your time on the remand, but I can't really fault the government for waiving a right to raise a claim under Clause 2, which is your second reason for not -- not remanding, and it -- it does seem, to, me that the Eleventh Circuit -- one permissible reading was that they were just looking at 1, so that we would have to remand.             I understand that.             Yes.      Except in this area, I am a little reluctant when it hasn't been argued before as to make a definitive holding, but I will look at the Eleventh Circuit opinion again.              Thank you.
08-724 +++$+++ 
08-728 +++$+++              Could you tell me how it works in district courts?          This district court set September 13 originally for the -- for the motion.                Do the district courts generally have a custom schedule for every case where they set times or do they have local rules on the subject?             Yes.             And that's -- that's part of -- that there in the local rule of court?             But I'm -- I'm not sure that that isn't -- that that argument doesn't cut both ways.             I'm not sure if that -- if you have a district where you have five days, a very short period and almost nobody can comply with it, then maybe that's an argument for the government's rule.               Well, I think an assumption in your mathematical analysis is that there will be a difference in the time that it takes to dispose of the motion.       If the time to dispose of the motion is the same, then you are wrong, I think.            I will work it out.              Right.              Right.              Right.                Well, what is your systemic concern with the -- with the government's rule? The judge has to grant the continuance under either -- under either of your rules, and you say he has to make a finding that it's good.        But are you concerned the continuance would be because the attorney wants to play golf or take a vacation with his kids, and that that's not the cause?                Is that's what's driving your concern?              But wouldn't judges in many cases do that anyway just in the course of deciding whether to grant a continuance?              Give -- give me the consequences of ruling for the government that you see that are adverse in your view.                 But that's my point.                 I assume the district judge will ask.     Or is --                 Or do you doubt that?
08-7412 +++$+++               I m interested in -- in two different things and you can address them during the course of your argument.      One is the assumption of the argument seems to be that there are in place parole -- throughout all the States -- parole systems which are effective, which are operating, and that they have the capacity to make accurate judgments about rehabilitation.    What can I read -- what -- what studies do you have to -- that -- that comment on that? Secondly, unrelated, at some point I think you ought to talk about the procedural bar, which is something you go over very, very, very -- let's see -- that's Sullivan.               Pardon me.   That's Sullivan, yes.              What -- what would you do if there were a crime spree and there were different jurisdictions?   One jurisdiction imposes for 35 years, the next jurisdiction for another 35 years, to be served consecutively.             So the second jurisdiction has the obligation, but not the first?            Is that the way it works?             I didn't -- I didn't hear the second.              Why does a juvenile have a constitutional right to hope, but an adult does not? REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN S. GOWDY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
08-7621 +++$+++              Well, suppose arguendo we assume that the judge is right, that Roper did not establish a rule that applies in this case.              Then what position are you in with reference to the procedural bar?    Do you have any other arguments that overcome the procedural bar?             And you say the -- under Florida law, the question is not whether the right was, to use the phrase, "clearly established"?             But the right is whether or not -- it had -- what was your phrase?              "A significant bearing"?
08-769 +++$+++              Okay.          And what case -- what case do you have for that proposition?              Can you give me an example of a case where we said a statute which might otherwise be overbroad is not overbroad because prosecutors have been restrained?   Can you give me one case where we've said that?              But that was a case where we knew what the content was.             The content was not subject to an -- to an overbreadth challenge.             The content was not.              Well, but that -- that went to intent.    It seems to me that -- let me tell you what I think your framework is and if it is wrong, tell me that it is wrong.      This statute without the exceptions clause would be wildly overbroad.                So you say it's not overly broad because of the exception or the savings clause.    I will call it the exceptions.              But it seems to me that the exceptions must be then tested as to whether or not they are vague.               And you have you to show that they are not vague.
08-810 +++$+++             Are you saying it's -- and these categories don't often help us.              Is this a question of law?     A mixed question of law and fact?            And that's the statutory term?   "Benefits due under the terms of the plan" is a statutory term?
08-861 +++$+++               What happens --               What happens to the information that the board obtains?                Can the board go public with that --               -- or is it all confidential?               The -- the burden of time of compliance?               The burden is because it's difficult and expensive to comply?             No -- but I'm -- I m talking about the harm to your client and to the -- those similarly situated.             There s the cost of compliance.    What other harms or dangers or risks are inherent in the power of the board unmonitored, unchecked by the SEC, to investigate?             But -- but the question is -- I assume it s the follow-up question that Justice Ginsburg is interested in -- under your view of the case, why is that lawful?
08-876 +++$+++                Are -- are you saying that unless we adopt the limiting instruction that you propose, the statute is then vague?                Just while we are on the Oeschler thing, and then you'll probably want to go on to the other thing. Assume this trial were held again.                 The government said:    All the same evidence -- same evidence.   Would that evidence suffice for an instruction to the jury?          Could the case go to the jury under the Oeschler theory?                Kickback or bribe.              Under the test that you propose, is the test the same?               Does the statute read the same way, and is the test the same for private and public officials?              Well, then we -- then if we accept your view, we have to have one subset of definitions for private officials and another for public officials.    It's hard to do that under the statute.              Well, under the judge's bribery case that we just -- that you discussed earlier, couldn't you take the position that that money the judge took as a bribe really should have been paid to the government?              But that would fit your test, though.             336.             But it said honest services include fiduciary duties under corporate.
08-88 +++$+++ 
08-905 +++$+++              Well, but if we had that --             If we had that kind of analysis, where the -- where the company has to reserve all of its defenses, then we would never get to the statute of limitations problem.            I think we have to assume that the -- that their theory of the case is correct.   We have to -- to assume it for statute of limitations purposes.    Of course, you deny it.             Well, I -- I think you don't get -- get very far.        And -- and it seems to me, as Justice Stevens's and Justice Ginsburg's questions indicate, that the companies can't have it both ways. They can't endorse the Twombly case and then say just an inquiry notice of a general -- of a general nature suffices.   You have to have specific evidence of scienter.   And there s nothing here to indicate that the plaintiffs had that.              Even on -- on -- but you have you to say, on their theory of the case.             Well, but if not, then the whole storm warning theory that you have conceded doesn't work.
08-911 +++$+++               The -- the -- subchapter 2 does talk about a special rule on reopening for battered spouses, children, and parents.             Is that a statute where the discretion is committed to the Attorney General?              So -- so it -- so absent the regulation, you would interpret the statute as saying there is no discretion?              No, that wasn't my question.    Let's say there s no regulation.           And the statute says, number one, there shall -- so subchapter 2 of the statute says, number one, there shall be motions to reopen.   And then there is a special rule for battered spouses. Now, you would interpret that statute, absent any regulation, as saying this is not within the discretion of the Attorney General?              Well, how does an Attorney General decide without -- without using discretion?              He must grant, in any case?       Whether a battered spouse waits for 15 years, he must grant? Just under the statute, now.              This is hypothetical.              Well, then there must be a discretionary component implicit.                I just want to return for a moment to the battered spouse provision.               The battered spouse provision specifically says that in the Attorney General's discretion, he may waive the time limit for the 1 year for the battered spouse. Now, that surely is discretion specified -- and I think the word "specified" is important here -- specified in subchapter 2.          So there should be no judicial review as to that. You would have to agree with that, wouldn't you?                All right.   So then the thing that Congress cares about most is something the court can't review.     That is counterintuitive.             What about my question with reference to motions to -- to reopen?             That is specified under subchapter 2.             That's right there in subchapter 2:     There shall be a motion to reopen. Now, if you had no regulation upon it, wouldn't you say that would be within the discretion of the Attorney General?             No.    No, that's not my question.    Hypothetical, not a real case.              Just a hypothetical.             Just so we can talk about the statute.     The statute says there -- subchapter 2, the one we are most interested in, specifies -- and that's one of the words -- that there shall be a motion to reopen. Now, don't you think that's within the discretion of the Attorney General, absent any regulations?             All right.    So absent a regulation, there would be jurisdiction stripping under that provision, right?             Why?             All right.   But you would give me, or would you, the concession that -- or agreement that the Attorney General's discretion to waive the time limit for battered spouses is committed to him?    And that's non-judiciary reviewable, wouldn't you think?             Again, that seems odd, that the thing Congress cares about so much that it makes a specific provision can't be subject to judicial review.              Can you give me an idea of how many motions to reopen are brought to the courts for review each year?              So we are talking about 2 or 3,000 petitions to the court each year?             Well -- but that would be a question of law which is accepted.             Have any of those courts said that they don't have a workload problem? (Laughter.)
08-9156 +++$+++              You don't have the cite for 542 F.3d, that part of the opinion?                It's in 542 F.3d, 1281, but I don't have the particular page. Okay.             But let's just talk about the -- the finding of -- by the district court that there was no strategic reason and the -- and the disagreement with that in the Federal circuit, and let's talk about it just under (d)(1) -- just under (d)(1).             Would you say that the test is whether or not the -- that finding was clearly erroneous?             Is that -- is that another way?             Why -- why is "unreasonable application" different from "clearly erroneous"?              Well, I'm -- I'm talking about (d)(1).              I-- I beg your -- (d)( 2), unreasonable determination of facts.              Yes.              So you -- you think there can be findings that are clearly erroneous, but not an unreasonable determination of facts?              I'm talking about (d)(2).               Because the problem, as Justice Ginsburg indicated, is that the courts of appeals are looking for guidance as -- as to when we can go into -- into these findings and set them aside.               And it really is very difficult for me to wear a "clearly erroneous" hat or an "unreasonable determination of fact."                   I -- I just can't sense any difference there.
08-964 +++$+++                But you know that the insurance industry -- the insurance business, as we know it, really began in England in 1680, when they discovered differential calculus, and they had expectancy and actuarial tables, actuarial for life, expectancy for shipping, and this really created a whole new industry. In your view, I think, clearly those would be patentable, the -- the explanation of how to compile an actuarial table and -- and apply it to risk.                 That certainly would be patentable under your view, and it's -- it's difficult for me to think that Congress would want to -- would have wanted to give only one person the capacity to issue insurance.             And so in the insurance case, it takes a person to go over to the Bureau of Statistics and compile statistics on -- on life -- on life expectancy.             In the Diehr case, the Court said that in the end, the abstract idea must be in a process that, oh, implements a proposal that the patent laws were designed to protect, which brings you almost back to the beginning.              You don't --             You don't know much from that language.     But that was something that you could touch, that you could see, that looked like a machine; the substance was different before the process and after the process.     And -- and none of that's applicable here. It's --                But it would be different, it seems to me, than what you are -- let's assume you can't patent an alphabet.          I assume that s true.          And you can take an alphabet to make beautiful words, and -- and so forth.      You -- you want to say that these -- these electronic signals can be used in a way just like the alphabet can be used. And many of the scientific briefs say that their process is different, that they are taking electronic signals and turning them into some other sort of signal.   But that's not what you are doing.
08-969 +++$+++               Well, suppose -- suppose you had a case in which an individual that lives in New York goes to a person with a supply of cigarettes outside the State and says:             I want to buy a lot of cigarettes and I don't want to pay taxes; can you help me?   And they agree on an arrangement to ship, to ship the cigarettes. Is there proximate cause?                  Is it there if the city sues for injury in that hypothetical case? Would you say there's no proximate cause?              And you think the city -- and you think the city cannot show proximate cause in a suit for its injury against the seller of the cigarettes?    You think there's no proximate cause in that hypothetical case?              Even though those are the only two people that have made the arrangement, and that was the whole purpose and intent of the arrangement? And you still say there's no proximate cause?                Well, what do you do with -- what do you do with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical?    I mean, she can pursue her own question, but I'm interested in the answer. Her question is, suppose the statute were amended so that the information had to be given to the city as well as to the State; would the case then be different, hypothetical case?
08-970 +++$+++              It is not clear to me what the district judge should do in making the lodestar calculation when he considers quality of performance.     I guess you are saying -- I think maybe you have already said --        that he can consider quality of performance, but only within the confines of what is a reasonable rate.             Because the brief for the Respondent said:     Well, you know, you are really counting this at the front end, and if you can do that, why not put it in at the back end?                 And I'm just having problems with that still.         Suppose the judge at the outset said:     This quality of performance is so good that, so far as the lodestar is concerned, I think a reasonable fee is above the usual hourly rate.             But -- so that in computing the lodestar rate, he cannot consider quality of performance?             Well, then it seems to me you're saying that he does not look to actual quality of performance.     He just looks to market rates without reference to that.     I -- I --             That's why I'm having -- I'm -- I mean, you know, the -- the question presented is -- is just quality of performance and results obtained; that's all we're talking about.             And I don't see why that can't be considered as part of the lodestar, and if it can be, then I don't see what the argument is about.               For extraordinary circumstances, what about a very, very popular cause and he wins and they are beating his door down?              Can we reduce it for that? (Laughter.)
08-974 +++$+++               Well, actually in -- in this case, am I correct that -- that 9 years has gone by, but that's because of the litigation?            The suit was filed, what, 4 months after the 300-day period ran?                Was it -- was it 132 named people or was it just 132 undifferentiated?
08-992 +++$+++               I -- I have a number of problems with the Third Circuit's opinion, but the question presented, it seems to me, is not really the dispositive point of the opinion.                I don't think the question you presented is really that squarely before us.             And I don't see a split, either.   I mean, of course, there is going to be some discretion.    The question is -- the Third Circuit, as I read the opinion, was concerned that it wasn't firmly established at the time of the waiver. I have real problems with whether the waiver should even be -- whether the time of the waiver is controlling, but that is not the question you asked us to resolve.             Well, I don't know why you submit -- why you seem to concede that that applies here.   I can understand why we want to look at the time of the waiver if it's an attorney arguing about jury instructions and so forth, but the man escapes when the door is open or when the window is open, and he doesn't give consideration to these things; and if he does, I think that's quite irrelevant. It seems to me that the waiver point is -- is something that shouldn't be conceded.                I think that if ten years elapse between the time of the escape and the time the State formulates its rules, that he is bound by those rules when he gets there.                But you don't argue that.    That's not what you presented to us.              But it seems to me that that's not what the Third -- Third Circuit was saying. It was saying that adequacy of the rule is determined by the law in effect at the time of the waiver, and it wasn't well-established. Now, I have real problems with that as an opening premise, but that's not what you asked us to resolve in your petition.
08-998 +++$+++              But in a sense that cuts against you.     As I was -- when I was reading your opening brief, it seemed to me the tone was, well, if you accept the Respondent's position Congress did nothing at all.     Well, they did do something very important.     They had a formula for disposable income. The question is, does that formula apply to projected? Can that formula be modified altered or projected for projected?     So it's not as if Congress did nothing or it's not as if the amendment accomplishes nothing even under the Respondent's view.              It accomplished something very important.             What -- where can you move it?   I don't really -- this is the same line of inquiry as Justice Ginsburg.     What's the -- what has to be the ending date if you move the -- you can't move it any - much beyond the date of what, the hearing?
09-10245 +++$+++ 
09-1036 +++$+++        But it won't be disastrous if they can ask to be registered.       Are you helped or hurt in making that argument when this is not de novo review? I think you're helped.     If it's not de novo review, that helps -
09-10876 +++$+++        I -- I don't understand that.     How is that any different than the supervisor of the lab saying, I know what these people do, I -- I watch them on a day-to-day basis, and they perform their work correctly?       What the State wanted to introduce is the result of the exam, and the Chief Justice gives you the hypothetical.     Say, two people are necessary for the exam.     You say only one has to be there if both saw it?       But it -- but it's hearsay as to what the first person did with -- with crimping -       -- crimping the thing. It's not direct testimony from that person.     You didn't say, are you experienced in crimping?     Did you use your right hand or your left hand?     Is there a danger of spillage?     And so on.     All that is beyond the ability of the defense to ask.       You always take your chances with a business record.     That's a given, of course.     Of course, the State takes a chance with the - with the admission of any admissible hearsay testimony that the jury will be -- that you'll make the argument to the jury that you should discount it if the person isn't there.     That's always true.       Now, I take it it's a testimonial statement that this blood that was taken at the hospital was the blood of the defendant.     That's a testimonial statement?       And so I assume that in this case, the nurse and the police officer were both present.       But I assume under your position, you could not have a record showing that the -- the nurse withdrew the sample at 10:08 p.m. on such-and-such a date and that she followed the regular procedure.     That would be insufficient if the State wanted to introduce just a certificate or just -- just that record?       It does -- it does not -       But the chain -- the chain of custody does involve a testimonial statement that this is the blood, that I took it out at 10:05 p.m. on Saturday evening.     That's a testimonial statement.     It's the defendant's blood.       Well, but if you want to tell us, don't worry, it won't happen, I think that's an unacceptable argument.     You're saying the defense has certain rights, and we have to presume there is a defense attorney who's going to afford his client every right the Constitution has.     So the fact that we're not supposed to worry because it won't happen very often is (a) it seems to me, an unlikely hypothetical; and (b) it seems to me, irrelevant to your argument.       Do the rules of criminal -- do the rules of criminal procedure in New Mexico say it should be prima facie evidence?
09-1088 +++$+++        I'll -- I'll think it through, but it seems to me that it's not consistent with what I thought the theory of your brief was for you to tell the Chief Justice that this is -- the hypothetical was a new claim. Take -- take the ACLU hypothetical that you discuss in your reply brief.     Is -- is that a new claim?       Okay.       But if it's a new claim, then if -- we don't look to (d) because it wasn't adjudicated on the merits.       -- and so you go to (e).       Well then, now it seems to me that you're saying that this is an (e) claim and that you'll just fight the battle on whether or not it could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.     You're -- and you're out of the (d)(1)/(d)(2) framework that you've been arguing up to this point, based on the Chief Justice's question and your response.       Well, I thought you said you agreed that it was.       Okay.     So then this is an (e)(2) case.       Then it's a procedural bar?     Is that -       Then it's a procedural bar case?
09-11121 +++$+++        Why isn't this all subsumed under the voluntariness rule?       Well, at least it's the court performing it, not the interrogating officer, as Justice Scalia's questions point out.       And then is it your point that he has to do something more than the read the standard Miranda warning?     Suppose he read the standard Miranda warning?     End of case as far as you're concerned?       Well, but doesn't it follow from there that we have to have a -- we have to change the warning?       I guess part of my problem is it's just in some respects hard to put the Miranda in the context of a -- let's say a 13-year-old alone.     It may be that Miranda warnings, "You have a right to remain silent, anything you say can be used against you" -- might terrify the kid just to hear about it.     I'm just wondering how the Miranda warning works here anyway.     The school is in loco parentis, it has certain -- it has obligations and privileges with respect to the student.
09-11311 +++$+++        I'm sure you'll do so in the course of your argument, but at some point give us some examples of violations of -- of this -- this statute which from a commonsense standpoint don't involve a serious risk.     There was something in the brief about, oh, well, the defendant might want to just find a safe place to pull over.     I -- I didn't follow that because it's an intent crime.     I just don't see how that would be a violation.     But if at some point in your argument you could address those points.       You're supposed to stop dead in your tracks and not pull off on the shoulder? mean, I don't -- I just don't understand this.     I'll go read the case, but -       Maybe that's why -- why it's a risk.     You stop in the middle of the road and then everybody - (Laughter.)
09-11328 +++$+++        Yes, but just to pursue Justice Scalia's point:     The good faith rule is itself a rule that's intact, that's a precedent, that was on the books, and the good faith rule qualifies the exclusionary rule.     So why aren't we just following the good faith rule here?       I mean, there's nothing retroactive or prospective about it.     It's just -- it's just applying the existing law.       Well, that's an application of -- that's a subset, it's one application, of the good faith rule, which is an overall principle. But we're being faithful, under the government's view, it seems to me, to the overall principle.       Well, you might respond that the government's going to say, well, there's Monell that's in their brief, and you'll probably say that that's a weak substitute for a criminal defense attorney's doing it in the trial itself.       Suppose we were concerned with the costs of your rule in the sense that Gant does have some exception for the safety of the officers, and I think you can read the case if there's some general safety considerations for not securing the car in a neighborhood rather than leave it by itself.     If we adopted your rule, the prosecution in all those cases would not have had the opportunity to make those additional defenses or those -- to advance those additional justifications for the search.     Maybe you'll say, well, I'm just trying to resurrect Linkletter.       Well, those cases were pending.     I was concerned with cases that were closed, I suppose.       In -- in -- in one -- in one sense if we're talking about costs, the rule the government proposes is -- is defendant friendly, in that this Court may be more willing to impose stricter rules under the Fourth Amendment, if it knows that the good faith rule will protect against the -- the costs of - of overturning the conviction.       But that could work to the benefit of defendants as a class, not the particular defendant?
09-115 +++$+++        Well, when I picked up this -- this brief and looked at this case, I thought: Oh, well, licensing, that's a defined term; I'll look in Corpus Juris Secundum or ALR or something.     But it really isn't.     Your brief indicates you start with dictionaries, fair enough.     You indicate what Federal licensing laws are.     But I see no limitation on what the State can decide is a license in any jurisprudential principle that you've cited.       Well, why is it -- this is the same question you're answering.     Why is it suddenly not a license because the -- because the State imposes an additional condition, where it was a license before?       And I -       But the Chief Justice - the Chief Justice can insist on the answer to his own question, but it seems to me his question is why isn't that still a licensing law?       But in the child labor example, why isn't that a -- an addition to a regulatory licensing scheme so that it's a licensing law?
09-11556 +++$+++        This -- this goes back to a question Justice Alito asked in a probably more artful way, but I'm not quite sure what's supposed to happen under your view after this stop.     They stop the person, they get the information that he's driving under a suspended license, and are they supposed to say, Oh, you know, we shouldn't have stopped you; I'm sorry, have a nice day, go ahead, and then he leaves?     Is that what goes on?       Well, why isn't impounding the car the fruit of the illegal search?       But why doesn't the public safety interest then permit us to use this evidence in order to protect the public safety further by punishing him for -- not driving?     I don't see the difference.       Well, why wouldn't you say the same thing about impounding the car?       And so how does that fit with your earlier answers that his identity here could be suppressed?     And then I'll ask a second question.     If you say that you can suppress his identity from information they gained after the stop when they saw him, why couldn't they say, well, we saw this man before we stopped him?
09-1156 +++$+++        Well, suppose -- suppose you stipulate, in response to the Chief Justice's question, that it's irrational, that it's probably baseless, but that the market will react adversely.     Is there a duty then to address the claim?       But -       But if there's a baseless report -- and we stipulate that, although it's baseless, it's going to affect the market -- could that be the basis for an allegation, assuming the requisite scienter, that there's liability?       But it's not the allegation.     It's the fact that the market may be affected.
09-1159 +++$+++        Could you tell me, assume no Federal act, let's just talk about two -- or parties that are not involved with the Federal Government. Inventor agrees to assign to A; then inventor - inventor in fact assigns to B; then A gets the patent -       In this case, if you do not prevail on your principal argument, have you preserved the point that the assignment to Cetus was contrary to public policy?       But the court of appeals didn't seem to discuss that.       Well, but Justice Ginsburg's question, and I have the same concern, is that why can't we resolve this case in a simple way? What you're asking for, based on submissions to us of amici, of amicus briefs, means a very great change in how -- how -- how patents are held.     If we can resolve this case on a simple contract basis, why not do it?
09-1163 +++$+++        Of course, if that's -- if that's the outcome of this case and if you prevail, that would mean that more things will be classified and withdrawn wholly from scrutiny; whereas, if other exemptions are used, they can be shared to a greater extent.     So really what you're arguing for is for withholding more information from more people.
09-1205 +++$+++        But just on notice, does the record show when the client first came to the attorney?
09-1227 +++$+++        Do our -- any of our opinions talk about the standing of the defendant?     I can't think of one at the moment.       So you want us to say that when there is a specific injury, specific to your client, that your client has the right to make any argument to show that the government has exceeded its powers under the Constitution, because those powers are limited to protect the liberties of the individual?       But you're -- you want us to say that, even if the defendant in some case might show that a constitutional violation is causing that defendant specific injury, the defendant may not be able to raise the claim of its, what you call sovereignty claim?     In Thornton v. Arkansas, the term limits case, we allowed a citizen of a State to bring a challenge to a statute that the State had enacted inconsistent with its Federal powers.     Now, that's the flip side.     That was a State statute, not a Federal statute, but it seems to me that is inconsistent with the position you're taking.     And it seems to me also consistent - inconsistent with the rule that separation of powers claims can be presented by defendants, in Chadha v. INS, Clinton v. New York, a line-item veto case. The whole point of separation of powers, the whole point of federalism, is that it inheres to the individual and his or her right to liberty; and if that is infringed by a criminal conviction or in any other way that causes specific injury, why can't it be raised? I just don't understand your point.       Well, all you're saying is that there's -- in that hypothetical is that there's no violation?       Everybody goes home.       Suppose a State wanted to be commandeered in Printz?     Suppose they said, we really like having sheriffs take the Federal gun registration law?       I -- I have -- I have -- I have serious trouble with that.     A State can surrender its -- its -- a State can confer more authority on the Federal Government than the Constitution does?
09-1233 +++$+++        Of course, but the problem I have with that, Mr. Phillips, is that at some point the court has to say:     You've been given enough time; the constitutional violation still persists, as the State itself acknowledges.       Overcrowding is the principal -- overcrowding is the principal cause, as experts have testified, and it's now time for a remedy. The court can't -- has to at some point focus on the remedy, and that's what it did, and that, it seemed to me, was a perfectly reasonable decision.       Well, at some point the State itself said that if it had, I think, 7 years, it could get down to 137.5 and didn't seem to object to that.       Yes, but the State -- the State did not claim that either order in either case has succeeded in achieving a remedy.     You've never claimed that.       And -- and just if I could have your attention for a moment.     I have this problem with the case:     Overcrowding is, of course, always the cause.     If I'm running a hotel -- if I'm looking at a highway system, I need highways, what's the number of cars?     If the problem is bad service in a hotel, well, it's the number of employees per -- per guest.     I mean, that's fairly simple. Now, I recognize, of course, that Congress has -- had imposed a special duty on us.     But I think it means that overcrowding must not be ordered unless that is the only efficacious remedy in -- in a permissible period of time.     And it seems to me there is massive expert testimony to support that proposition on the part of -- of the prisoners.       Well, but the experts testified to that effect.       And the strike force and the governor's -- governor's commission reached the same conclusion.       The strike team, I think they called them.
09-1272 +++$+++        To knock on the door?       They must have probable cause to knock on the door?       No.     All right.       Okay.     Take us -       Take us through it -- take us through it chronologically.     The policeman is walking through the hallway.     He has no probable cause.     He - he -       He smells marijuana -       -- then he knocks on the door.     When did the probable cause arise and when must it arise?       But -- this may be a bit rudimentary, but can you tell me why isn't the evidence always being destroyed when the marijuana is being smoked?     Isn't it being burnt up? (Laughter.)       So the distinction is being destroyed as opposed to being consumed?       Is it your position that the police can do anything that's lawful, even if the purpose of doing so is to create exigent circumstances?       The -- the question presented in the blue brief used the word "impermissible," and we're talking about "unlawful."     I take it that there is a difference in those -- or no difference?
09-1273 +++$+++        Before the statute was amended by I think the Patient Protection Act and there was a breach of the agreement, did the government assess penalties?       Because -- and the reason I'm asking this is that you indicate that the government had a contract remedy.     It seemed to me it had a regulatory remedy.       What was the contract remedy that it had at the time this case arose, which was before the -- these mechanisms.
09-1279 +++$+++        Well, in that instance, does the corporation have standing to raise that objection on the employee's behalf?       Well, as an administrative matter, can the corporation make a FOIA objection on behalf of its employees?       All right.     That's the next -- that was going to be my next question:     So the corporation can raise FOIA on its own behalf?
09-1298 +++$+++ 
09-1343 +++$+++        Your answer to Justice Ginsburg -- I don't want to make your argument for you, but it seems to me rather strange.     All of a sudden you're talking about how Ohio law will help you out. I thought the question was, from the standpoint of the defendant at least, whether the defendant purposefully availed itself of the forum.     And you would say the defendant here purposefully availed itself of Ohio by choosing an Ohio distributor.     But you don't make that argument.     You're talking about a contract, an indemnity, which seems to me another step.     That's choice of law and applicable law.       Would you say the same thing if, hypothetically, since we're engaging in a hypothetical, the distributor were in France -- machine manufactured in England, distributor is in France, and the distributor then selects the United States and then the same facts, New Jersey?     United States would be an appropriate jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause, but not New Jersey?       Assuming the statute that Justice Scalia hypothesizes.       It's a little odd that the States, which have residual sovereignty, which are not limited sovereigns, would not have jurisdiction, but the United States, which is a limited sovereignty other than in the foreign affairs area, which may be relevant here, does have jurisdiction.     That seems backwards.       But the question is why the State can't make the same choice that the Congress does.     The State lacks foreign affairs power, to be sure.     Is that the only distinction?     That doesn't sound to me like due process.     What we're talking about is a source of authority, not fairness to the defendant.
09-1403 +++$+++        The rule isn't, I take it -- or correct me if I'm wrong -- that simply because the issue is on a class-wide basis, it can't be challenged at the certification stage.     We don't have a rule that's that broad, do we?     Or am I missing a point?       But suppose there's no demonstrated basis that that common issue exists?       And except, just to add to the Chief Justice's question, an efficient market theory?
09-1454 +++$+++        Of course, there are two issues here, and I hope we do get to th substance.     Can you tell me Camreta's current occupation?     Does the record establish that?     Does the record tell us what Camreta is doing now?     Is -       Which is?       This is a Monell claim, and it's -- and the district court has held its ruling, I take it, in abeyance pending -- a ruling for reinstatement of that claim, pending our decision here?       Well, on -- we're getting to the merits.     Do you agree that search -- strike that -- that seizure under the Fourth Amendment is the relevant category here?       You agree that the child was -- was seized?       What -- what happens if the teacher tells -- the student is misbehaving on the playground:     Go back in the classroom.     You can't -- you sit there by yourself.     You can't be part of recess. Is that a seizure?       What made this a seizure? The fact that it wasn't a teacher?       Well, but I'm -- I'm asking for your view of the proper category to apply in these cases, and if it is a seizure, then -- then it's just a question of reasonableness, and we'd look at all the circumstances.       It seems to me it would affect Camreta's behavior and that of other child protective officers.     The lawyer would explain:     Now, legally this is not binding; it just never happened. But three judges of the court of appeals in a reasoned decision have explained why this is contrary to the Constitution, and it would seem to me that any conscientious law enforcement officer would -- would take that seriously into account.
09-1476 +++$+++        Do you -- can you think of any instance where speech by the employee would not be protected under the Pickering-Connick free speech calculus but would be protected under the Petition Clause?
09-1498 +++$+++        But the Chief Justice says only if it -- it's really a circular argument -- only if it results in a delay.     Well, suppose it doesn't result in a delay?       But that doesn't -- that prove the point that I think is the concern of the Chief Justice's question, that in some cases the delay - there's a delay that results and in other cases there isn't.       You said at the outset that things have been working fine.     Of course, the whole point of the Act was to hold district judges to a pretty strict standard, and the concern is that there might be a very complex case the judge just really wants to put off as long as possible and will continue to accept motion after motion.     Is there anything I can - I can read or consult to show that this has been working very well and that there's not a problem?
09-150 +++$+++        And you -- you do not know if the man is running amok and threatening to shoot other people or if -- if he's drunk, if he's on a rampage, if it's a college campus, then it's -- it's - it's a sniper.     You just don't know.       But you can -       Well, I'm not -- I'm not sure that policemen should read Crawford before they perform their -- their peacekeeping duties.     The - no -- no one questions the right of the police to -- to ask these questions and to use the word either "happens" or "happening" or "happened." The question is whether the -- the answers are later admissible.     Those are two different inquiries.       And, of course, Crawford rejects reliability as a criteria.       Did the police know that that was the case when they began the questioning?     Did the police know that this man was not on a rampage, that he was not going to act in self-defense when they came after him?       That he was not taking hostages?       Let's say -       Let's say that we -- let's say that we agree with you that there was an emergency and the police were asking questions in order to mitigate the emergency. What would be the rationale for admitting this statement, then?     Is it more reliable?     Because if we say that, then we're undercutting Crawford, which says reliability is not the key. What is the reason for that?     Is it because the police likely have less motive to manipulate the - the statements and to ask loaded questions?     That in itself, it seems to me, is a reliable -- but what's the -- assuming we adopt your distinction, what's the rationale for the distinction?
09-152 +++$+++        In a question of fact in a case-by-case determination in every State, the manufacturers would probably be worse off under your approach than if they didn't have the law at all, because the law seems to at least qualify section - comment k.       Does the secretary -- does the secretary have the authority to -- to withdraw certification on the ground that it is no longer safe, fair, and potent?       You are assuming that the manufacturer knows something that the secretary doesn't?       But -- but you assume that there is no clause or burden to the manufacturers who defend these suits to assess settlement offers.     This is a -- this is a tremendous expense.       It -- it may well be that the manufacturer has to settle a meritorious case; we all know that.
09-1533 +++$+++        You mentioned leaves several times, and you talked about that in your -- in your brief.     If this were a trial court and we had two world-class chemists, strictly from a chemical standpoint wouldn't they tell you that the cocaine in a leaf is in a salt form, not a base form?       Does that depend on the age of the leaf or if it's been in the sun or is -       No, no, no, no.       I thought that the chemists said that it's always a salt.     And you -       -- I thought that was the government's position, that it's a salt.       But you ended by saying oh, sometimes it's a salt.
09-158 +++$+++              Well, I -- I'm not sure. And getting back to Justice Alito's point, if -- if we say that the conviction is separate from the sentence, he can't challenge the conviction without being - meeting the successive bar, what about the finding of death eligibility?      Why -- why can't that be separated from the sentence just like the earlier conviction?                That followed from the first conviction.               Well, I -- I -- I want you to get -- on the assessment of the evidence, I just want to ask -- I probably should know this, and you can get back to Justice Alito's question as well.                  Under Alabama procedure, at the sentencing hearing both in the first trial and the second, is there evidence about the aggravating and mitigating, or do you just look at the evidence that was proven in the guilt phase?               Is there new witnesses, et cetera?              But then it's -              -- not clear to me why death eligibility wasn't a part of the first conviction.             Well, how -- how does the State's definition at page 17 of the red brief not comport with the whole idea of second or successive?               No, but that's not - that's not something that could have been or was raised.              Well, if it's the second -- I see your light's on.                 If it's the second time around, then it's just barred by law of the case.
09-223 +++$+++              Well, I suppose in discrimination cases, if there is a discrimination men versus women one way to resolve it would be to have either -- either rule apply to both sides.              And you reach that conclusion under the comity principles of Fair Assessment?              Revenue depleting.              -- but, why wasn't that addressed in your view?             If -- just one more.    If the remedy is likely to be we will leave it up to the legislature -- you had -- you had two or three different optional remedies -- would we say that that is an adequate State remedy?             Contempt of the legislature?     Contempt did you say?
09-291 +++$+++        Could she have gotten reinstatement on the grounds that his continuing inability to be employed by the company is an ongoing hurt to her?       Suppose an employer - suppose an employer dismisses an employee on an impermissible ground, impermissible under Title VII, and it's a very valuable employee.     Can the shareholders sue on the ground that the shareholders are now injured because the company is worth less, having lost this employee, under Title VII?       No, it's the same hypothetical.     We'll just say Regalado, all the same facts, except she is very valuable to the company.     The company is now worth less; shareholder sues.       And in -- in your view, could Regalado have brought this suit or brought a suit?       Well, if that is so, why doesn't that vindicate the purposes of the Act?       Well, but I -- I assume that part of the thrust of your argument is that this was designed to hurt this -- Regalado, that she was hurt, that this was injurious; then you say, oh, well, it's not important enough for her to sue, so somebody that's more remote can sue.     That's an odd rule.
09-329 +++$+++        Judge Cudahy in dissent relied very much on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking.       Judge Cudahy in dissent relied -- put considerable reliance on the ANPR.       And when was that staff comment made?
09-337 +++$+++              Let me -- I ve been thinking about the Chief Justice's question where the two people are pushed and you don't know which person -- or two people fired the shotgun, and there s only one pellet, and you don't know which gun the pellet came from.                   In that case, I think we could stipulate that even by reasonable inquiry, you wouldn't know. In your case, I think the -- and I think the difference in the case is that "reasonable inquiry" means you should have known.           So now we have a rule that excuses something you should have known but doesn't excuse something you -- you couldn't have known, which seems odd.   And because it's odd, therefore, maybe that's why it only applies to clerical errors.              Did your amended complaint contain any new and material allegations other than the name correction?
09-338 +++$+++               Can you tell me, along the line of -- the same line of questioning, I understand about AEDPA.     I understand about deference, the jurisdictions.     Just tell me a little bit about how this often works in State courts and in Federal courts? Would it be good practice, in your view - and that may not control your case, but would it be good practice for the -- a judge to have had exactly this colloquy and then say:         The jurors are dismissed while I talk with counsel.      And you say:             Counsel, in light of this response, I am prepared to declare a mistrial.                      Do you have any comment? Is that good practice?              I'm asking -- I'm asking if it's good practice as a general practice.             Because -- because that will bear, ultimately, on a constitutional issue.                   I understand deference.       I understand that all intendments are in favor of what the State Supreme Court found.                     I'm just -- I want you to tell me how it works out there in the real world?             That independent obligation is not reinforced by getting counsel's views just as a matter of good practice?             Well, there was a ruling by the court:    I hereby declare a mistrial.                  I suppose you could have an objection, but it would be very -- the jury was present when the judge said:                    I hereby declare the mistrial.              So it would be rather awkward for the counsel at that is point.             Acrimony, I recognize we have talked about it in Arizona, but it -- I mean, it could be that the jurors had all agreed on the murder count and they were just quarrelling over whether they should add the firearms count, or the other way around.                In which case they would be much closer than -- than your comment about acrimony might indicate.
09-350 +++$+++        Does the State make that payment under an Ex parte Young theory?       If you sue the municipality, if they deny a marriage license, do you have to sue under 1983, or you can just sue alleging a Federal cause of action under -- because of a denial of a constitutional right?       It would be like a Bivens action, I guess.       The only way to sue a municipality for a constitutional violation is under 1983?       But could you sue outside of 1983?       Just to get -- the marriage license example -- just to get an order demanding issuance of the license.       And that has to be a statute -- it has to be 1983?       Can -- can Bivens actions be brought against municipalities?       And can you -- can you cite me authority for that?     And would -- do you think that the rationale for that is that since Congress has created an express cause of action, this impliedly pre-empts Bivens-type actions?       And have -- have we said that in a case?       Because it seems to me it would help you in this case, because you would say, well, if there's a real problem, the city -- the injured party can sue for an injunction.     Perhaps the State was against the party first, and he can -- he can raise a constitutional defense or he can bring an action for an injunction, and it doesn't have to be under 1983.     And it would seem to me that that would resolve it.     And you then wouldn't have to pay attorneys' fees because there's no provision in the statute for it.       No, I'm talking about under Federal law.       And California itself or the Ninth Circuit had a case in which the county sheriff was directed by a judge to garnish certain wages or certain accounts; the sheriff had no choice, apparently, other than to follow the judge; and the Ninth Circuit held Monell is not required when you seek declaratory relief against future actions, and so attorneys' fees are given.       It doesn't make any difference?
09-367 +++$+++               Well, you re not really -- you re not really answering Justice Alito's question.     He says he understands that, as I understand the question.     We understand that argument. But it doesn't address the fact that the net result of your argument is (a) unfair to the victim and (b) inconsistent with the whole design and thrust of the Victims Act.             And you, it seems to me, have to say:     So be it; the technical rule prevails. That's too bad. I mean, that's your argument, it seems to me.
09-400 +++$+++        Well, that's a sweeping rule.     I was going to ask a related hypothetical. Suppose the -- the officer who's in charge, charged with the decision to terminate or not to terminate, says: I'm going to have a hearing.     You can both have counsel. And you have -- who is it -- suppose Buck -- suppose the two employees that were allegedly anti-military here testified, and they said there was no anti-military bias, and the person is then terminated. Later the employee has evidence that those two were lying.     Could he bring an action then?       That's sweeping.     That's almost an insurer's liability insofar as the director of employment is concerned.       He has to ensure -- he - that he has done everything he can.     He has a hearing, and he has almost absolute liability.
09-448 +++$+++                 Well, this district court kept jurisdiction over the action.                     He more or less waited to see how the story came out before he wrote the plot.     Suppose the district court said:                  All you came to me for was an order for remand.                   I give you the order for remand.     Case ended.          At that point, he doesn't know how it's going to come out.                At that point, can he -- can the district court award attorney's fees?             So that even if, when it goes back to Reliance, Reliance finds that it s patently frivolous, close to a fraud, she -- the employee still gets the fee?                Well, I -- I can see now why the red brief has a very substantial appendix with statutes.   Now, you say, oh, this is unique.                    Well, then we may have many, many different kinds of statutes.                        This does not provide for -- this is not a prevailing party statute.              But just in going through the list of the statutes, there are many statutes that are not prevailing party statutes.                   And it seems to me that -- you say it's unique.              Well, it's unique in the sense it's in ERISA, but I -- I think it's very close to many -- many of the statutes with the language there in the red brief's appendix.             Well, under your -- under your rule would it be error for the district court to terminate its jurisdiction?              It must keep jurisdiction to see how the play comes out in the end?             Well, but it certainly has to in order to adopt the ameliorating factors that you -- that you use in order to justify this rule.                          And I -- I -- it's not clear to me that courts usually retain jurisdiction in these cases.
09-475 +++$+++                And is it your position that that gives you the hook, the entry point, for saying, well, now the district judge didn't just replicate in all respects the universe without the regulation; it had some specific injunctive relief, and it didn't go far enough?   That s --             And in your view the correctness of that ruling has been preserved in the questions presented to this Court?
09-479 +++$+++  
09-497 +++$+++                 Why is it post-formation? Arguably, the -- one of the parties has such a strong hand that it forces the other party just to decide. It's almost like -- duress would certainly be for the court, would it not, if it s a formation issue like Justice Ginsburg indicated?                Well, I'm not sure what procedural unconscionability, but this is -- as Justice Ginsburg indicates, it's not clear to me why this isn't a formation issue.             Well, do you understand -- and we can ask the Respondent.             But, as you understand Jackson's case, is he saying that part of the clause, part of the arbitration clause, is unconscionable, that the whole clause is unconscionable or that the whole contract is unconscionable?             Because the complaint is a bare-bones complaint, and I don't know if there s anything in the pleadings that reflects what his answer to that question would be.
09-520 +++$+++        But in light of our AFC case, it seems to me that what you are arguing is that the statute -- the effect of your argument is that the statute gives more protection in the case of non-property taxes than property taxes, and that's an - an odd reading of the statute, which is directed primarily to the -- to the property tax.       But in this case - correct me if I'm wrong -- off-road users, agricultural users, and construction and timber companies -       -- have the same -- have the same tax structure as the railroads.       So there is an objective reference, neutral, and it seems to me that that's just quite rational to put the railroads there and not in the category of road -- road users. Now, if -- unless you are arguing the discrimination has to have -- has to have a purposive component.     That might give you a different case.     I'm not sure you prevail on that, either.       Suppose a -- suppose a tax were structured so that the same tax applied to railroads and -- and -- and motor transport, but because of the way the tax was assessed, the railroads paid far more per mile than -- than the -- than the road transport.     Could the railroad then come in and say: Oh, we want to be like the farmers; we are off-road? I mean, I can see you making that argument -       -- in case -- in case number two, welcome back.     That's going to be your argument.       You present the case to us as if it's either/or:     That we must either in disagreement with your position, to say that it doesn't apply to exemptions; or if it applies to exemptions, it must be remanded.     Can we say that the exemptions are not covered by the act unless the railroad is a target of an -- an isolated target and it's clear that it's discriminatory? I mean, do we have to have your either/or position?
09-5201 +++$+++                What do you do with - if -- it's a very short sentence?                 A year and a day, in your view, is a year and a day less 54.               But 360 days, what do you do with that?               Yes.       If -- suppose it's for -- just -- the whole sentence is 360 days.               No, 360.        In other words, short of a year.               So the person that gets a year and a day serves less than the person that gets less than a year?
09-525 +++$+++        But can -- can we discuss the case, and -- and perhaps you don't think so.     Can't we discuss this case, must we not discuss this case, on the theory that JCM's scienter, JCM's knowledge of a false statement, is a given in the case? Now, maybe you'll be able to prove otherwise.     You say that they're not liable anyway.       And it seems to me that's what the argument here is mostly about.       But, once again -- once again, if the complainants in the case, the plaintiffs in the case -- hypothetical case, not this case, hypothetical case -- were injured shareholders in the fund, I take it you say still they could not sue JCM?       Well, let's say that JCM's principal officers and managers wrote the statement. You still say there's no liability?       Yes.     It's not attributable, at least publicly, to JCM.       Is there an alternate theory that JCM is really the day-to-day managers in day-to-day active control of the fund, and, therefore, it should be chargeable as if it and the fund are the same for purposes of making the statement?       And we would say that that's different from, say, an outside law firm or an auditor?       Just -- just to clarify Justice Breyer's hypothetical.     In your -- in the hypothetical you gave where the president gives an innocent board of directors false information and the prospectus goes out, is the company liable because their agent -- is the company liable under 10b-5?       Yes.       So what you're saying is that the -- the agency relation that the president of the company holds is different that than the agency relation that JCM holds?       Why is that?       Well, but -       So even though they did those things, they acted in excess of their authority?       But that's the allegation.       Well, suppose it were proven that they did do those things.     Suppose it were proven that they did 100 percent of the prospectus work. The only thing that the fund did was to mail it.
09-529 +++$+++        But there are a number of instances in the States where constitutional officers have their separate autonomy, their separate responsibilities.     And it seems to me to follow inevitably from your position that the attorney general of State A could sue the governor of State A saying the governor is being sued in an Ex parte Young capacity because the governor is not following Federal law.     I think that's just inevitable from your -- from you position, and that seems to me a vast extension of Ex parte Young.     It's true, I think, that we've never said that the identity of -- or the permissibility of an Ex parte Young suit depends on the identity of the plaintiff, but don't we have to say that here if we're going to allow the States to structure their -- their own governments as they choose?       Well, he would tell the governor that the governor is not giving adequate protection to prison inmates or State employees, that the -- that the governor's own personnel regulations are incorrect, and he would sue under Ex parte Young.       There are all kinds of Federal rights.       And the question is one State entity enforce it against another State entity in a Federal court?       Well, but that's -- but under -- under your theory there would be, because under Ex parte Young, the whole point of it is that a -- a person can allege that this fictional private individual who's really a governmental individual is violating a Federal right.     That's the whole point of it.       All State attorney generals have the -- have the obligation to enforce Federal rights for all of the citizens of their States.       Well, that -- that issue -- I know your white line is on. You -- you indicated that there are certain cases in which dams can be authorized by the Federal Government, I think, contrary to State laws, with municipalities.     Do you know what those are?     There's an Iowa case; there's also a Washington case you were talking about.       Do you have the citation?       I've been looking for it. Okay.       Going back to your exchange with Justice Breyer, I assume that you could stand by your answer and say the attorney general could sue the governor, because he's not suing the governor in his official capacity.     He has a Federal right under Ex parte Young to sue the governor as an individual.     It's a fiction; we all know that.     But that's the way it works, and this is a Federal right.       I think that's your position.       Of course -- of course, Verizon was a private party.
09-530 +++$+++        And -- and if we did so, it would be because there is an underlying privacy right that's somewhat ill-defined or undefined?       Well, does it -- does it help us in finding what this residual background right is and asking you:     Why is it that you can't disclose it?       Why can't you disseminate the information?       Let's assume no statute.       In other words, this is just testing whether there is some background constitutional right and how to define it, if we have to use that as a beginning premise.       And what would be your position if the -- all this information were disclosed? Or that there was an attempt to disclose all the information, and they asked you for your advice --   -- on a constitutional basis?       There are a number of statements in, I guess, the concurrence from the denial of en banc, explaining how JPL is fairly open, and it is close to the Pasadena courthouse.     Pasadena residents and judges visit JPL often. Are there any statements of fact that you don't agree with that are not in the record, other than the matrix question?     Leave that aside.
09-5327 +++$+++               Why should -- why should that be?     Two cases.    Two criminal defendants.           One spends a lot of time trying to find the most competent lawyer he can, and he does.           He finds a highly skilled lawyer, who makes one little mistake and it's negligence. The other doesn't care.              He gets a lawyer that's really incompetent, and the lawyer is grossly negligent. Now, you would be penalizing the client who exercised the most diligence under your rule.                I don't understand the -- the justice of that.                It seems to me that the first client should be better off, not worse. Now, maybe this is for your friend on the other side to answer as well, but I'm not sure, even following Justice Alito's initial line of questioning, we can distinguish between gross and mere negligence, that -- that it's even fair that we do so.              I didn't mean to interrupt his line of questioning, but it seems to be consistent with it.             But what's the -- what's the point?     What's the justice in doing that?             Other than just limit the number of cases in which we are going to set aside convictions?                I looked in the brief to see if there was reference to the merits, underlying merits of the case.     Can you just tell me very quickly what the key arguments are, if we ever reach the merits?                Yes.                Well, I shouldn't probably take your time with that.         I will look at the State record.             The client -- this client was sort of the pesky client, but apparently knew a lot more about AEDPA than most people generally do.           I mean, AEDPA's not exactly an ordinary term.             And -- and suppose you have a client who is just bewildered.          He doesn't know AEDPA; he doesn't know Federal court.          Why should he be in any worse position than this client?             It seems to me it would be the other way around.     This fellow knew enough that, if he had really just done a little bit more, he would have -- well, he tried to file a petition, but he might have done a little bit more.             But the uninformed client, the ignorant client, could never have approached this. I don't know why he shouldn't be more protected than your client, which goes back to Justice Alito's question. I'm not sure how we draw this line.
09-559 +++$+++              Well, let me -- let me ask you, could the opponents of a particular ballot measure organize a boycott for -- and picket businesses whose managers had supported that boycott?             Had supported that initiative?             Well, if that's so, then under Claiborne Hardware, which I -- I notice you didn't cite in your brief, but if -- if that's so, then it seems to me that the State's -- or that -- that the signers' interest in keeping their names private is somewhat diminished.             It's a First Amendment activity.             But --             And so Justice Alito's question points out that this would be a very slim basis upon which to rest a holding in your favor. And just to go back to the line of questions of the first, the State of California has very complicated referendum and initiative matters.              Don't you think it's relevant for the public to know that, say, a public employees union had paid solicitors to put those signatures on the ballot, or that the Chamber of Commerce or the National Association of Manufacturers had paid solicitors to put this on the ballot? Isn't that part of assessing the -- the reasons why this initiative was proposed?              And isn't that vital to the voters -- to the voter in making an informed decision?             Correct me, but the point is, isn't -- isn t there an interest in knowing this information?     Not -- not that it's paid.             We'll leave that out. But -- but to know that -- that -- the persons that supported the amendment.
09-571 +++$+++        On your instruction in --       -- at J.A. 28 second, would the instruction in your view have been proper, if the "or" had been replaced by an "and."     So:     "The situation involved a difficult choice and one that prosecutors had a history of mishandling."       Has there been -- has there been any argument that you have waived your objection to the instructions?       In other words, the pattern instruction was -- it was -- was rejected?
09-5801 +++$+++        Is -- is this your -- are you taking this in the direction of an argument that Congress gets less deference in determining nationality than it does with admission to aliens?       But you -- you want us to write an opinion that says Congress has less deference when it considering -- when it determines who should be a national of this country than it -- than when it determines who should be admitted as an alien?       Are you asking us to write that formulation in an opinion?       If I -- if I take that as a "yes" answer, what is your authority for that answer? It seems to me that it ought to be just the other way around.       Of course, but it was Congress that made the distinction.     But you are asking us to say that Congress has less authority over this essential issue as to who should be nationals in the United States.       Maybe there is some authority for that.     Do you have any authority?     Is there something I can read that tells me that?       That was an alien admissions case.     You are talking about nationality.       But any of -- of the remedies that you are discussing with Justice Scalia involves this Court in a highly intrusive exercise of the congressional power. Let me just ask you this as an analytic matter, or as matter of logical priorities.     We usually talk about substance first, remedy second.     Do you think it's permissible, logically, for us to say that because the remedies here are so intrusive, that bears on our choice of whether we or not we use intermediate or rational basis scrutiny, and because the remedies are so difficult, we are going to use rational basis scrutiny? Is that a logical way to proceed?
09-587 +++$+++        Of course, it said -- it just said denied on -- on the merits.     And it's still not clear to me how to -- pardon me.     It just said "denied"?       It's still not clear to me how to distinguish that, between denied, deny -- do we say, when there's a one-line order, as in this case, where it says simply "deny," it is presumptively on the merits?     I mean, how -- how do we interpret that?       Then it is presumptively on the merits?       They don't -- I mean, is that the way it's stated?     Don't let me use my formulation.     What's -- what's the State's formulation?       But if I'm on the California court and I have two choices -- one is to say denied, no explanation, as this case; the other is to say denied on the merits -- if I have those two options, then why are they both on the merits?       And what is the leading California authority on that proposition?       That's the Robbins case. Okay.       All right.     Thank you.       But isn't it the reality that sometimes the defense doesn't want to have an expert, because the expert may turn up findings that are adverse for him, and it's better for the defense counsel to just leave things murky and argue to the jury that the State didn't produce the evidence, either?     That's a perfectly legitimate strategy, isn't it?
09-60 +++$+++              But -- but does --              But does it make the -- the second unlawful entry now lawful?              I thought -- I thought it's a separate offense to enter, to reenter improperly, and -- and that stays no matter, isn't that correct, regardless of the correctness of the prior removal order?              Or am I wrong?               But we have five States, isn't it, that have no recidivist provisions?               Is the thrust of your argument or the logical consequence of your argument, if you have one of those States with no recidivist provisions and you have ten separate possession convictions, they're still not a recidivist under the Federal rules?                No, no.     In my hypothetical, what would happen if -- if there was a deportation proceeding?                Because there is no recidivist finding.              We usually think of recidivism when we talk about statistics as being repeated for any crime.      This is a recidivism of a special kind.   It's repeating the same -- the same thing.             Is that essential to your argument?             I know it's essential to the -- to the Federal statute.
09-6338 +++$+++              Well, why is that?     It's the same hypothetical of the Chief Justice.                 I'm not interrupting your -- your discussion with him.                 Suppose, pursuant to a permissible regulation, the BOP says:                   Just file paperwork with us, and if -- and if you show that you were under a crack cocaine sentence, you re going to be reduced by X number of months, period.             Just file it.   What --        Is there a problem with that?        No, but the -- the hypothetical is Congress doesn't do this.             The        What s wrong with that?               Okay.    Then the Chief Justice's hypothetical, at least for me, meant:                   What -- why should there be a difference?              I ll make this brief because your -- your rebuttal light is on.                Your answer made sense when we talk about term as opposed to sentence, if you just look at (c).                But (b) says, Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence to imprisonment can be modified  & a judgment of conviction that includes such a sentence constitutes a final judgment. Does (b) not apply to (c)?
09-658 +++$+++        It's a little hard when we take away the finding that the confession was admissible.     We have to extract that.       I'm not quite sure what to do with the State court's case, assuming we have to presume, because of the posture of the case, that the confession was inadmissible.
09-6822 +++$+++        If Congress reenacted 3742(g)(2) tomorrow, would it be valid?
09-737 +++$+++        Well, of course there's always -- there are always facts.     There are often disputed facts.     But suppose the issue is whether or not this right -- and maybe there are two rights here - this right was clearly established.     That's -- that's an issue of law.       And doesn't that fall within the "except" clause that the Chief Justice was talking to you about, which you haven't had much time to fill out, I understand. But -- well, if you're going to say -- and it's really not whether the summary judgment is -- is appealed.     That's a little bit -- it's whether or not the issues resolved by the summary judgment motion are appealable.     I read into your response, or implied from your response, what the Chief Justice did, that maybe sometimes the summary judgment motion, say, on an issue of law is sufficient to preserve the issue.
09-751 +++$+++ 
09-804 +++$+++        Excuse me, Chief Justice.       Well, turning to (a)(3), I have two questions.     One is, as you -- and this is probably for your friends on the other side more than you.     But as you understand the "likely harm" standard that prevails in the Second Circuit, is it likely harm to a majority of the members of the class, all of the members of the class?     Do you know?     Has the Second Circuit told us what that means?       Or -- or a significant number?       My question had no import. I really wanted to know the answer to that. (Laughter.)       Your white light is - just one more thing.     If you proceed under (a)(3), doesn't Mertens bar the award of -- of monetary damages?       Well, then -- then you're not offering us much.     You say:     Oh, please go under (a)(3), but then you go back and say:     Oh, well, you can't get monetary damages.
09-834 +++$+++        Well, I'd like to go back to the question -       What -- what would you say about his point that it seems to me had substantial merit?     It - it's really our determination -- our interpretation of what filing means might well depend on whether filing in -- or a complaint includes intracompany complaints, the grumbling of an employee and so forth; and I recognize this -- this argument comes up late.     Has it been addressed in any of the other circuits?       All have said that intracompany complaints -       In those circuits where they allow intercompany complaints that are oral, can you give me any sense of how often this leads to claim for retaliation?     I mean, are they in the hundreds or.
09-837 +++$+++  
09-846 +++$+++        Do you read the claim in section 1500 the same way that it should be -- or do you think we should read it the same way in 1500 and 12(b)(6), failure -       Whether or not you've stated a claim upon which relief can be granted?       But the accounting doesn't come out of the trust corpus if there is misfeasance, the trustee has to pay the damages for that?
09-868 +++$+++        Let's assume that we adopt your formulation generally, that it has to be for legal error, collateral review has to be for legal error, and we could even add what the Ninth Circuit has found, it has to be by a court in order to avoid clemency, parole review boards, and so forth. I don't see why you don't lose anyway, because the allegation here, the complaint, the argument, may be that there was an abuse of discretion, and if there's an abuse of discretion, that is a legal ground to set aside the -- the sentence.       Well, it's a motion made in a court, reviewable by the appellate courts of the State.       It's a little odd to say that that's not legal.     If -- an abuse of discretion standard is something we're quite familiar with in the law.     We've never thought of that as being somehow extra-legal.
09-893 +++$+++        But it seems to me that all State -- most State statutes pertaining to contracts pertain to a class that is not entirely universal. Suppose the State had a statute referring to banks, contracts with banks.     That doesn't apply to all contracts.     It doesn't apply to railroads.     But we know that it applies to a class that generally includes both arbitration and non-arbitration.     And that's this case, because there can be class action rule with respect to litigation and class action rules with respect to arbitration.     So you have to have some rule that recognizes that you don't have to have the entire universe of contracts.       And I'm not quite sure what your test is.     You have a few of them in your brief.
09-9000 +++$+++        It does seem odd, though -- and I don't want to jump into your argument too much, because you have got planned out what you want to tell us.     It does seem odd that if your suit for DNA testing is not attack -- an attack on the sentence, that you asked for a stay. I mean, if it's not an attack on the sentence, why shouldn't that factor into our decision not to grant a stay or to grant a stay?     It's -- it's an irony in your position.       Well, we don't grant a stay in order to decide a question.     We grant a stay because there's a likelihood of success on the merits. And that goes to the sentence.     And now you're telling us that your attack doesn't go on the sentence.     I don't see why we don't just lift the stay, under your own view of the case.       If that's all it means, we shouldn't have granted a stay.       Except that at page 18 of the yellow brief, where you did have time to explain your doctrine, you say a Federal constitutional issue arose only because the Court of Criminal Appeals' decision regarding the State law issue turned out to be so arbitrary and unreasonable as to denying Mr. Skinner's Federal due process rights. Correct me if I am wrong, but I think -       I thought that's Rooker-Feldman to a tee.     Correct me if I'm wrong.       Why isn't it a correct formulation of your answer to Justice Scalia to say what we are seeking is a determination that the State court's judgment, State court's decisions, State court's order was a violation of due process?     If you say that -       But that's Rooker.
09-907 +++$+++        Is that the general view of the courts?     Is the answer that you just gave supported uniformly by the courts that have looked at this?       Even -- in other words, even on this point, they are split?       My question, incidentally, about courts was not with reference to the car expense. It was with reference to the hypothetical or to the issue proposed by one of my colleagues, that said, what if you don't -- Justice Kagan -- suppose you don't have the medical expense.     And the answer -- and your -- and I wanted to know if your answer is supported uniformly by the courts that have looked at this, or if there is also a split on that point?       And would your answer be the same if the allowance was set, the decree was made, and -- and the debtor then went out and bought the junker to put in his driveway just in order to get the 400-plus dollars a month, or would that be deemed an evasion of the law that could be addressed by the Bankruptcy Court?
09-958 +++$+++        Could a State in its own courts provide for procedures whereby adversely affected parties could test the regulation?       It seems to me you have to say that.     Otherwise the next question would be under Gonzaga, you wouldn't say that a State can entertain a monetary cause of action.     So, I think that's consistent with your position.       Well, when you say -- that brings me to a slightly different point.     You -- you introduce the fact or the consideration of what's administratively workable.     The brief by the former HHS officials says quite to the contrary.     It -- it says that there are almost $400 billion of HHS expenditures that are supervised by 50 people.     That works out to 800 million each; and they say, we don't have time for this. And it's much more efficient and it's much more consistent with the application of -- proper application of Federal law to allow this action to be brought in the -- in the courts.       Well, I mean, that's "the sky is falling" -- 700 judges.     It would be just each district if it were in every district.     And it -- it -- and certainly to the extent we are involving a State, there would be only one State involved.     So -- so, there is just the State of California, and there are only four districts there, and the suit could only be brought in one.     So, I -- I think that's an -- you know, I don't think that the "sky is falling" argument really works.       Well, the courts, I take it, have the prerogative, perhaps even the obligation, under the primary jurisdiction rationale to simply withhold adjudication until the agency acts.       But that's an abuse of discretion, not an absence of power.     You're arguing an absence of power.       Under the --       Under a pre-emption -- would it be a pre-emption argument?       Do you --       Do you agree with the counsel for the Petitioner that if the State chose to allow its courts to issue an injunction on Supremacy Clause grounds in the State courts, that that would be impermissible?
09-987 +++$+++        I just want to make sure I heard your answer to the -- you said the answer is yes. In other words, you agree with Justice Kagan's criticism of those cases, and you said, yes, she's right; those cases were wrongly decided.       But you would have said there would have been no standing in those cases.       Does the record show the extent to which there are donations by people who do not have students?       Does the -- does the record show the extent to which there are these additional donations that you just referred to?       Suppose that an STO - this is a hypothetical case -- discriminated on the basis of race.     No Hispanic or no white or no black can receive our money.     And suppose there's no Federal statute on it, no State statute prohibiting this.     Would there be a constitutional violation, a Federal constitutional violation?       No, it's an STO.       All right.     There are no attributes of State action that would suffice to allow a discriminated person to bring suit, a person who has been discriminated against?       No, the hypothetical is no Federal statute, no State statute.     It's a pure -- it's a State action question, is what I'm asking.       Well, don't you think a strong argument can be made that it can be attributed to the State.     The State has all sorts of rules about what an STO has to be.     The State provides the mechanism through -- through the credit for the funding.       What about -- what about -- what about the answer to my question?       You're saying the STO - you're saying STOs are sufficiently private so they can do this.
09-993 +++$+++        Can we call this the take steps -- is this the take-steps doctrine, for purposes of discussion here?       It's not clear to me whether you say that that is preempted or just that it was not well-pled.     I'm not -- I'm not sure of your position on that point.       Is -- is there any breakdown as to how many of those requests are generic and how many from branded?       Buckman was a case -- I'm pronouncing it right, I think, Buckman -- where it was a branded manufacturer, was it not?       A medical device manufacturer.     So there it was -- it was an FDA process, and we said there's no State cause of action for saying that the FDA process -- that's slightly different from saying that you have a duty to warn the FDA.     You might say it's a fortiori.
09-996 +++$+++        Is it arbitrary and capricious for a court to take the ground of least resistance, to decide the case on the easiest issue that's presented?     Is that arbitrary and capricious?       The phrase is "substantial delay."     Are there factors other than temporal factors that go into whether or not the delay is substantial; that is to say, the prisoner had difficulty contacting his counsel and so forth?     Is that what the court looks at -       -- when it looks at "substantial"?     And is there -- are there California cases that tell us what the -- how do we define "substantial"?       It's supposed to be filed within 60 days.     I don't -- this is along the same lines as Justice Kagan's question.     Suppose there's the first round of habeas, and then he waits 60 days and files the new claim.     Would that be substantial? Because you're indicating that failure to include it in the first review is a factor to be weighed against him.     And I think that's what the Justice is inquiring about.
10-10 +++$+++        Well, my -- my question just follows from what I think Justice Ginsburg must have in mind.     My understanding is that it's a commonplace if the witness declines to testify even though the witness has immunity, or the attorney or the witness declines to produce a document, the judge says you will remain in jail until you comply.     In most of the States, I think he's allowed counsel, but does the broad statement that you -- or the broad argument that you responded, that you're making when you answered Justice Ginsburg's case, apply there, so we are in effect saying in all these cases you must have appointed counsel?       You're committed to custody until you testify.       "Mr. Bailiff, take him out."       Well, I -       My concern is -- and it's been brought up in some of the other questions that Justice Ginsburg asked earlier.     I just have the sense that there are thousands of these hearings around the country, and they're -- and they're very important in order to ensure child support, and that if we adopt your rule, in many cases where counsel are now waived or not present because of the -- the noncompliant parent is going to ask for counsel and that we're going to change the entire landscape of domestic relation proceedings, the Heisenberg principle.       In every case?     I mean, doesn't the defendant have to -- or the -- or the noncompliant parent have to ask for counsel?       My question is are there any data -- are there any data to show that in most of these cases, counsel does, in fact, appear? My -       My assumption is not, but I just -
10-1001 +++$+++        But we want to know what rule you're advocating in this case.       We want to know why you're not advocating for what Justice Breyer and Justice Alito indicate is an endless right to claim that all previous counsel were ineffective.     You say, oh, no, you're not arguing that.     What is the rule that you are arguing for?     What limiting principle do you have so that we do not have an endless right of counsel?       But -- I understand that. But what is it that prevents the Petitioner from saying that the first counsel in the collateral proceeding was ineffective and that so was the second?       But can I -- can I leave this argument with the -- with the judgment that you've offered me no limiting principle on how many proceedings there must be --       -- before there's an end to the argument that previous counsel were inadequate? I understand, this is the -- in this case, it was the first counsel in -- in the first collateral proceeding that we're talking about.     But why couldn't it be the second?     You don't give us a limiting principle.       And if you want to say there shouldn't be, then that's fine.
10-1016 +++$+++        Because this is for money damages.       Because this is for money damages.     Ex parte Young was just injunctive relief. The Eleventh Amendment primarily protects the treasuries of the State against money damages.       It's not Ex parte Young.
10-1018 +++$+++        And I -- I suppose you can argue that there is a built-in limitation because the question doesn't even come up unless there's state action.     So, there has to be close enough cooperation so there's state action.     I had never thought that when a private attorney gives an opinion letter to a government agency or government entity at its request that there's any state action there at all.     So, that question -- so, there the question just wouldn't even come up; am I correct?     I assume --       It's just hard to imagine anything more imbued with state action than imprisoning someone.     That's -- that's the problem I have in thinking about the case.       Another question that's not teed up and I guess not presented -- I'm just curious to know about the history of the case.     Was it argued that there was no state action here?     Or is there -- and in your view, is that a very simple question to answer?
10-1024 +++$+++       Under --      Are there -- are there instances where, if there's an invasion of privacy and 2     there's a documented trauma from psychosomatic illness 3     with medical expenses and lost wages, is that special -- 4     is that actual damage?
10-1042 +++$+++        Have we said in some of our cases, oh, don't worry, this is within the discretion of the prosecutor, close enough for government work?       Does HUD have expertise in interpreting criminal statutes?       Well, I'm not sure.     It seems to me that even under the Respondent's view of the statute, you have to inquire into reasonableness to see if the fee was earned.
10-1062 +++$+++        Can you tell me, what would be the scope of your holding?     How would -- how would -- if you could write the opinion for the Court on this part of your case, what would the rule be? I mean, health inspectors go into restaurants all the time and say:     Unless you fix this, I'm going to give you a citation.     Fire inspectors, the same thing.     And I'm -- I'm wondering how your general theory or your general principle that you want us to adopt would fit with that rather routine type of enforcement?       So, this is under -- this is under the APA.       This is the APA prong of your argument.       To apply for a --       But then the compliance order would automatically be vacated?     I mean, doesn't the compliance order presume that they are wetlands? Hasn't the agency already made that determination?       If they're wrong about that, if there is a finding in the APA process that these are wetlands, is that the end of it?     Or within that, the context of that review, can you say, well, they are wetlands, but only to a minor extent, and these conditions were onerous and -- and far more than necessary to protect the wetlands?     Can you argue that in the APA review?     Or is it just up or down:     Wetlands, you lose; not wetlands, you win.     That's it?       Are there cases in the courts of appeals or the district courts where landowners, having received these notices or compliance orders, have said that there's a taking of the property, inverse condemnation?
10-1104 +++$+++        Can you tell me why it is that you care in this suit?     If you're telling us, oh, don't worry, there's going to be liability and probably perhaps even more extensive liability than in Bivens, what difference does it make?     Bivens doesn't give you attorneys' fees.     Now, it's true that the Federal question may get you into Federal court.       Just because of the statute of limitations?       If we're looking -- if we're looking forward beyond this case --       -- and there's no statute of limitation problem, does it really make any difference that he have this second cause of action that's just --       -- (a) duplicative or (b) arguably narrow, more narrow?       But why?     What --       What difference does it make?       Who cares?
10-1121 +++$+++        Well, are you saying that this is capable of repetition, yet evading review?     I'm not quite sure.       Does the injunction have future -- future terms?     Is it a permanent injunction or is it just an injunction that relates to the notice that's required in this case?       Do you make that argument in your opposition?
10-114 +++$+++        Did we take the case on the assumption -- your -- your predecessor and you may disagree -- but did we take the case on the assumption that this was a frivolous cause of action?       Well, that's not quite right.     To the extent they overlapped, even on the theory the Federal claims were presented, the plaintiff below was seeking attorney's fees -       -- under 1983.       So the city's liability would be greater.       And I don't want to have you adopt this phrase, but just to clarify, are you saying that it's a but-for test, that you get only those fees for time that was -- that would not have been incurred but for the frivolous claim?
10-1150 +++$+++       In thinking about what's 20     pre-empted, I looked at the Diehr case involving the 21     rubber molding --      -- and the constant monitoring.    And if you could take an analogy from that, 25     let's -- let's suppose that there was a system of measurements that you take every half-hour which constantly monitor how a drug is being retained in the 3     tissues, and that there is a protocol for the admission 4     of some two or three different drugs to get the balance 5     right.    In other words, it's much more complicated. 6                 Is there some point at which that is 7     patentable, even though this pre-empts a -- a whole 8     range of different choices?      But you're giving a 8     different answer.      -- the right way to do it. 14                 MR. SHAPIRO      Nature always -- nature      Nature always has a 13     reaction to the drug.      It's hard to resist the 4     temptation to peek into the obvious component or the 5     nonobvious component and then go back and apply it to 6     101.      You want us to discipline 9     ourselves to talk just about 101 in this.      I think I'm having the 18     same trouble as Justice Kagan.      Why can't you just go -- 22     the hypothetical was -- was one range, one result. 23     Pardon me.    One measurement, one result.    Suppose that 24     just continued over a range.    And they said if it's 40, 25     then you have this; if it's 50, you have this.
10-1195 +++$+++       I'm not sure I'm understanding your answer, because I have one of the 3     same problems as Justice Breyer.    Of -- the design of 4     this statute, from what I can infer what the congressional intent was, is for an individual person to 6     be able to go into small claims court.    And the 7     defendant will usually be the telephone company that 8     wants to remove it to Federal court and, as Justice Breyer said, instruct the attorneys always go to Federal court; the word will get out.    And you're 11     saying, oh, don't worry about that; that won't happen? 12     That will happen.    That's exactly what's going to 13     happen.      Whether the word gets out 18     or not, they will all go to Federal court. 19                 MR. NELSON information on the -- I mean, there are small claims 22     courts in State court.    Is there any practice of removing $500 claims and paying much more than the $500 24     that's at stake?      Could you clarify one 22     point for me.    You indicated that no State has said that 23     you cannot bring an action, and yet -- then you said 24     that Texas said it has to be specifically authorized. 25     Did the legislature of Texas specifically authorize it?      Don't let me misstate what 3     you said.
10-1211 +++$+++        So, you draw the line -- your position is that only those who have entered a guilty plea are entitled to the presumption against non-retroactivity, but not those who've been found guilty?
10-1219 +++$+++        What evidence --       Oh, please, continue.       Well, that was -- that was Judge Newman's view, but the en banc court took the middle position.     Often, in trial court evidence problems, the judge says, well, it goes to its weight, not the admissibility.     And it seems to me that's what Judge -- the en banc majority was saying, that the fact that it was not presented before or that it points in a different direction from what the PTO found goes to its weight, not its admissibility.     In other words, they will give consideration to the fact that it wasn't introduced and -- and maybe discount it as a result, unless there's a reason.     So, it just depends on the facts of the case. Number one, am I reading or am I summarizing the en banc majority correctly?     And, number two, why isn't that a sensible way to interpret the statute so, as Justice Ginsburg is suggesting, you give some meaning to 145?     It's -- it performs a function that 141 does not.       Well, then -- then you're saying that we -- that we should choose either between your position or Judge Newman's position.
10-1259 +++$+++        Well, under that rationale, could you put a beeper surreptitiously on the man's overcoat or sport coat?       Oh, no.     This is a special device.     It measures only streets and public elevators and public buildings.       Well -- and on that latter point, you might just be aware that I have serious reservations that there wasn't -- that there -- about the way in which this beeper was installed.     But you can get to that at -- at your convenience.       Well, but the owner of the can at the time it was installed consented, and that is not this case.     There is no consent by the owner of the property to which this device was affixed.     In fact, it was done, as Justice Scalia indicated, surreptitiously.       You probably haven't had the opportunity to go into the cases.     A hypothetical. Suppose exactly these facts, only the police aren't involved.     A neighbor does it to another neighbor in order to see where that neighbor is going, and when he finds out, he tells his wife and other neighbors.     Do you think that in most States, that would be an invasion of privacy?       We measure it by expectations of privacy under the Katz test if -- that may or may not be controlling.       It found that there was no expectation of privacy.       I am asking you about this case, whether there would be an expectation of privacy --       -- as a general matter under tort law.
10-1261 +++$+++  
10-1265 +++$+++       Well, but abuse of 6     discretion doesn't mean that the judge operates in a 7     vacuum.    If we make -- issue an opinion and say, oh, 8     well, that the standard is an abuse of discretion, that 9     doesn't tell people too much.    Abuse of discretion based 10     on what standards, what inquiries?    And that's -- and 11     I'd like to know what your position is on that, because 12     it seems to me that, at the end of the day, it's going 13     to be something very close to interests of justice. 14                 MR. CAMPBELL
10-1293 +++$+++        I didn't quite understand that.     Today there's a -- there's either a potential or a fact of violent and objectionable broadcasting in radio?     I didn't quite -- just to understand your point.       Yes, I understand that. Yes.       What -- what you're saying is, is that there is a public value in having a particular segment of the media with different standards than other segments.     And forget radio.     Let's just talk about television.     But -- you know, in the briefs, it says how much -- how many cable stations there are, and you, what do you call it, surf the -- you go through all the channels.     And it's not apparent to many people which are broadcast and which are not. But you're saying that there's still a value, an importance, in having a higher standard or different standard for broadcast media on the television.     Why is that, when there are so many other options, and -- and when it's not apparent to many viewers which of the two they're watching?     Just because it's an important symbol for our society that we aspire to a culture that's not vulgar in -- in a very small segment?       Well, but --       But then there's -- and then there's -- and then there's the chip that's available.       And, of course, you ask your 15-year-old, or your 10-year-old, how to turn off the chip.     They're the only ones that know how to do it. (Laughter. )       But is your point is -- is that the chip technology works better if you have this differentiation between broadcast and cable media?       Well, in a way, that's circular.     That's what we're here to argue about.     I'm asking --       -- is there a functional, a pragmatic, a practical difference between the two?
10-1320 +++$+++        Suppose the -- suppose the court said, after this colloquy, I want you to go back and think about this whole case again.     Could the jurors then have revisited the first count?       The capital murder count?       No.     The colloquy is what we've got.       And the judge said I want you to deliberate more about this entire case.     (A) was he permitted to do that under Arkansas law, I guess is one of my real questions.       Nothing -- nothing -- Arkansas law doesn't permit the jury to -- before it's delivered its final formal verdict, to think about the case again and vote on it again?       Well, but I -- I think this may be what Justice Alito asked.     Well, I -- I don't think it gave a verdict here.     I don't think it's revising its verdict.       It's mid-deliberation, as Justice -- Justice Scalia said at the outset.       Well, but then I'm not sure it's just a matter of State law then, we're -- what we're doing here is talking about the constitutional minimum.     And I -- Justice Scalia gave a hypothetical, you can have a more -- even a more principled juror than that.     He says, you know, now that we're thinking about manslaughter, it is true that thus and so happened; maybe we were wrong on the first -- first-degree count.     I mean, that's perfectly plausible.       Why should there --       But that's -- but that's after a verdict.     Why is it that the purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause are implicated when a jury, before it delivers a final verdict, says where -- where it is mid -- mid-deliberations?     The defendant, of course, is terribly disappointed if they go back and then find him guilty.     So, I guess there's a personal disappointment interest for the few hours that it takes for the jury to come to a different verdict, but he doesn't have to prepare the defense again; he doesn't have to go to trial again.     It's all one trial. I don't see why there's a double jeopardy interest in the Massachusetts case that you point out. I don't see where the double jeopardy interest was in saying that you can't go back.       What -- what --       What purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated by the rule that says you can't go back?       I'm asking why it's the heartland of the Double Jeopardy Clause.       I question that.
10-1399 +++$+++ 
10-1472 +++$+++        Well, is it true that as a matter of common usage, when we are talking about oral testimony in court, we often use "interpretation" and "translation" or "interpreter" and "translator" somewhat interchangeably, but when we're talking about rendering a document into -- into a different language, we generally talk about that as "translation"?     This is a matter of common usage.     Do you think that's correct?       That wasn't quite my point.       My point was that I think we say -- in fact, in a Supreme Court case, we've said in the Hernandez case, when we're talking about oral testimony in court, we tend to use "translator" or "translate" and "interpreter" or "interpret" somewhat interchangeably.     Is that correct?       Well, what's -- what's your position?     I -- I take a deposition at -- in my law office and I have to have an interpreter there.     Is that recoverable or not?       Well, how do you think it affects the way you read the statute?     What do you think should be the result?       Let me ask you this question:     In the background here, is there some concern that we're going to have minor cases but with huge translation costs, and it would be simply unfair?     And if the answer to that is "yes," isn't that taken care of by the statutory direction that the court "may" give costs?       Well, isn't that an abuse of discretion?       Well, I mean, in other words, if the court sees that the cost of preparing documents into an English-language is quite substantial in light of what's involved in the case, and it's just not fair to -- to award them, can't that court in its discretion deny that, or is that not the way it works?
10-1491 +++$+++        But, counsel, for me, the case turns in large part on this:     Page 17 of the red brief says, "International law does not recognize corporate responsibility for the alleged offenses here"; and the -- one of the -- the amicus brief for Chevron saying "No other nation in the world permits its court to exercise universal civil jurisdiction over alleged extraterritorial human rights abuses to which the nation has no connection." And in reading through the briefs, I was trying to find the best authority you have to refute that proposition, or are you going to say that that proposition is irrelevant?       And it's -- it involves your whole argument, of course.       But in -- in the area of international criminal law, which is just analogous, I recognize, there is a distinction made between individuals and corporations.       But I agree that we can assume that Filartiga is a binding and important precedent, its the Second Circuit.     But in that case, the only place they could sue was in the United States. He was an individual.     He was walking down the streets of New York, and the victim saw him walking down the streets of New York and brought the suit. In this case, the corporations have residences and presence in many other countries where they have much more -- many more contacts than here.       But you go much -- you go much further.     Suppose an American corporation commits human trafficking with U.S. citizens in the United States.     Under your view, the U.S. corporation could be sued in any country in the world, and it would -- and that would have no international consequences.     We don't look to the international consequences at all. That's -- that's the view of the Government of the United States, as I understand.
10-1542 +++$+++        Is that change alone sufficient for us to say that this is -- was a clear indication by the Congress of an intent or purpose to alter the imputation rule?       Can a parent ask for a permanent resident status for a 5-year-old child?       So, if you have two cases, one -- two 5-year-olds.     One, as in this case, lives with the parent, but the application has not been granted or not been filed; and the other, the application has been granted.     And they're treated -- they're treated differently?       Can you give me an example of an instance in which a child who is the child of two lawful permanent residents cannot get lawful permanent resident status for himself at the age of 8, but that he can at the age of 15?     I mean, what commonly happens between that period that would make him ineligible -- eligible only when he is 15, other than just as a matter of providing all the documents?       Well, you -- the whole point here is that some children are given lawful permanent resident status and -- and some are not.     But I'm asking, does the passage of time, assuming two lawful resident parents, ever make it so that a child who was formerly ineligible is now eligible?     He was ineligible at 5, but he's eligible at 14?     I mean, how does that work?       Oh, I don't mean a visa number.     But nothing -- nothing with -- with respect to the child's real status other than his -- where he is on the queue in the immigration department?       It's a little odd that the domicile is the more exacting of the two requirements, and yet the Congress allowed imputation in the domicile case but not -- not in the residence case.     It seems almost backward.       Congress enacts a more forgiving and less exacting standard, but then takes away the imputation.       The -- the Respondent said that the BIA gave no policy reason, no policy justifications, for its -- for its interpretation. Is that correct in your view?
10-174 +++$+++        Well, if -- if you had a State court suit with a State plaintiff, wouldn't the State be able to adduce Federal common law as a ground for recovery?     And then we would get to the merits and see if there is a Federal common law cause of action.       Well, we all -- we all know that you sometimes have to peek at the merits to see if there's standing.     There's a little cheating that goes on.     But -- but in this case it does seem to me that you're lacking any clear precedent.     When I think of standing, I think of Frothingham v. Mellon.     That isn't this case.       I'm more receptive to this kind of argument if I know we're going to the merits as opposed to standing -       -- and I recognize that we slip in and out of the two categories, and don't want to make it difficult on you.     But I take it that these arguments also go to whether there's a cause of action on the merits.       Is part of the inquiry, part of the dynamic, how imminent the Federal regulation is?       Well, again, that just goes to the merits.     You make that argument to the district court that your injunction is meaningless, equity does not require an idle act.     End of case.       Well, I'll think about it, but Newdow was a case where we thought that this particular litigant was not directly injured.     Here the State said it's directly injured.     That's the distinction.       Same -- same hypothetical, assume no Federal statute, and -- and assume no Federal common law.     What about State law?     Does State common law become displaced because it's a matter of Federal concern?     We don't -- we don't -- we don't usually have preemption of Federal common law.       The hypothetical is that the Federal law -- Federal statutory law doesn't apply.       It would be very odd to say that there's no Federal common law, but also that there's no -- no displacement of State law.     That - that seems to me odd.
10-179 +++$+++        Is there any authority - this began as a motion for -- for nondischargeability.       Is there -- is there - are there any cases in the -- in the Federal courts which tell us that a motion for nondischargeability does or does not require the pleading of a counterclaim?       Well, that's because there's a basic sovereign immunity.     The government doesn't have to be sued at all.       -- so it can -- so it can make conditions, but that's not this case.       But that's because of the limitation of sovereign immunity, and you don't -- and you don't have that analogue here.
10-188 +++$+++        Suppose that in this case, the agency has said:     Well, we have 10 files where these documents are, and we'll make them available you to in the reading room.     Go to the reading room. Is that a report?       Well, I don't know if the files are digitized or not, but if they want this particular veteran's report, suppose you could just push a button, and they all come out.     Is -- is that a report when those veteran's documents are just put together in a rubber band and shipped off?
10-209 +++$+++        Suppose this were a death -- a death case, and roughly the same facts, failure -- failure to communicate.     And that leaves me just one other question based on your opening remarks.     We can think about adjudication as having a constitutional violation, injury, and remedy.     Are you saying that there was a violation in the abstract here but no injury, or was there a violation and an injury but just no remedy?       So if you could do all of that, including the death penalty, I --       Well, but you skipped over a step.     I think we do assume that the deficient advice led to the -- the determination to plead not guilty.       Well, but that's the question -- that's the question we're confronting.     So, I think --       -- your answer was a little too facile on that point.       We have to assume there's ineffective assistance of counsel in advising the client the nature of the charge for the -- so that the client can make up his mind whether to plead guilty or not guilty.       We have to assume that in this case, correct?       And that would also be your position in a capital case?       That gets back to my question:     Is it a violation in the abstract then, of damnum absque injuria?       Damage without injury.       Well, it's correct, but is it enough?     Do you want us to write an opinion that plea negotiations are not a critical stage of the criminal process unless at the end of the day a guilty plea results?       Okay.     So, we --       Justice Kagan and I want to know what your test is.       I have one, but it's more appropriate, I think, for the Government of the United States.     Under the Federal rules, Rule 11, there has to be a colloquy before a plea is entered.     Do you think the Federal rules and perhaps State rules should be amended so that judges, trial judges, before imposing a sentence inquire:     Have there been plea offers; have they all been communicated to the defendant? Is that good practice?       Well, if they had -- if plea offer had come out -- well, I don't know how it would work.     When you enter a not guilty plea, you enter a not guilty plea.
10-218 +++$+++       But how would the boat get up there?    Does it just jump over the 10 feet?      Okay.    Then that would 16     work.      Then that would work. 19                 MR. KNEEDLER      And what were your -- what 3     were your other four points you were going to give us? 4                 MR. CLEMENT The next point:    Justice Kagan, you asked 14     about, you know, do the other owner -- other people on 15     the river have anything to fear.    And the answer as far 16     as I heard was, well, these are different.    They sit on 17     the riverbed.    Well, two things, Your Honor:    So do some 18     of the piers, and that's why people have filed amicus 19     briefs and are very concerned. But more to the point, these things have not 21     moved under the riverbed recently.    They've been sitting 22     there for a hundred years, and the State lent its eminent domain power to us to help us build these dams. 24     These dams were critical to developing energy and 25     development in this area.    And now a hundred years later, they want compensation for the little river 2     strip under that.
10-224 +++$+++        In that respect, do State inspectors routinely go on the premises of slaughterhouse to ensure that their coextensive laws are properly enforced?     And if that's so, are there problems of judgment, that a Federal inspector says, no, this is okay under Federal law, and the State official says, no, this is not okay under the State law, even though they say the same thing?
10-235 +++$+++        How did it happen that in FELA we have proximate cause light?     It's just a different proximate cause than we see in other -- in other torts cases.     How -- how did that come about?       Can you read the cases as indicating that more deference is given to juries in FELA cases than in other cases?       Do you think that over the last few decades, there's been an increasing emphasis on foreseeability as a component of proximate cause?       Although your proposed instruction didn't use the word "foreseeable"?
10-238 +++$+++        In -- in this case, do you think the law is content-neutral within its own universe, which applies just to political speech, so it's not content-neutral in that sense?     But within the scheme that it sets up, is it content-neutral?       Why?       In Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical -- I'm still trying to think about - suppose there is one candidate for the -- for the pink party, and then three candidates for the orange party, and all three candidates for the orange party received the lump sum Justice Ginsburg was talking about.     But there's only one candidate on the other side, and he has to face, or she has to face, three. Is that constitutional?       One person is on one side; three people are on the other side.     And under the Arizona law, if the three people on the other side are all participating candidates, each of them gets a bonus if there's only one person speaking on behalf of the non-participating candidate, right?       All right.     So $10,000 by the non-participating candidate triggers off $30,000 against him?       All right.     In Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, wouldn't you have the same problem in different terms, in that one candidate faces three people, all of whom are funded by the -- by the government?       I'm just asking as a theoretical matter whether there would be a constitutional problem in the case that I put under Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical.       How about under the First Amendment?       Do you think it would be a fair characterization of this law to say that its purpose and its effect are to produce less speech in political campaigns?
10-277 +++$+++        The Chief Justice's question reminds me somewhat of our rule in Monell under 1983:     A city is not liable for a -- a constitutional violation unless it has a policy.     Would you think that we could use that as an analogue to determine whether or not there is a common question here?       Suppose, following the Monell analogue, there's -- it's a -- there's a showing of deliberate indifference to the violation.     Would that be a policy?
10-290 +++$+++        Burden of going forward or burden of persuasion?
10-313 +++$+++        I have just one small question on that.       Suppose that there are two competitors and each of them wants to connect, but each of them wants to connect at a different point and in a different way.     Must the incumbent accommodate both if they're technically feasible?       You say that this is a link, and your -- the opposition says that it's a -- that it's transport.     Is that correct?       But the -- but the reg says interconnection does not include transport.       I have -- I've got it in front of me.     It says, "This term does not include transport."     But you -- you say it does?       No, I'm talking about --       -- interconnection.       Yes.       But I -- I wasn't sure of if -- if it was a transport or link.     That -- that's my concern.
10-382 +++$+++        Other than the time and expense of going through voluminous records, which is obvious, is there any other harm to the government in being required to show that there's a competing interest that makes disclosure unnecessary or improper?       I hadn't thought about your argument until this -- until you made it this morning, that if there -- if -- if the tribe is correct that it owns these documents and gets -- can get them anytime, but the -- the -- the trial court here divided the documents into five categories.       As to some of those categories it -- it denied -- it denied production.       And I take it did that in the context of recognizing the attorney-client privilege, including work product, which were the accountant's records.
10-444 +++$+++        But we take the case on the assumption that he hadn't heard of the earlier better offer.     Am I wrong about that?       Well, regardless, your legal position is that there is no basis for setting aside the plea if an earlier, better offer was not communicated. That's your legal position, right?       You say -- you say there's --       -- no Sixth Amendment violation when the counsel fails to communicate a favorable offer to the defendant.     That's your position.       That's what we took the case for.     We didn't -- we wouldn't have taken the case if we were concerned about what happened in March and what happened in February.     We took the case because of your position, that this is not a Sixth Amendment violation in these circumstances.       It's -- it's very odd for you to say that -- to me -- that this is not a critical stage.     If it results in a guilty plea and the -- and the attorney has not done sufficient research to uncover a defense, it can be set aside then.     So, it's -- so, you're saying it's not a critical stage depending on what the end result is.     That's very difficult. I thought we were going to tell attorneys, you have an obligation during the plea bargain process to use professional competence.     And you say, well, you do or you don't.     That doesn't make much sense.       If defense counsel gives wrong information to the defendant about witnesses that can testify on his behalf and so forth, very bad legal advice, that's -- that can be ground for setting aside the plea, correct?       All right, so -- and that's because counsel pre the entry of the plea did not adequately advise his client.       Why -- why is there no problem when he doesn't adequately advise a client of earlier better offers?
10-507 +++$+++        But --       But if -- if you had said status or situs, then it seems to me it would have made more sense, given the language of the statute.     We will all have hypotheticals.     We won't have too many, but it's quite common on oil rigs that the employees bring some of the equipment back to the land, clean it, prepare it, and so that they can bring it back to the next -- the next shift on the rig.     And some of this machinery is complicated.     It has springs in it. Suppose that the worker brings the machine back from the rig to the land, to the base of operations that's land-based, and is injured in repairing that machine. Under your view, no coverage?       I think that's quite difficult to square with the "as a result" language because this is a result of the operation.     Let's just say the machine got broken because of the -- of the operations, and there -- and he's fixing it and he's injured.       Well, the Government and --       The Government and the Ninth Circuit take care of that by saying that the person has to have -- the injured employee has to have spent substantial amount of time on the -- on the offshore operations.     So, you could add that.       Yes, I agree.     I thought you had a backup argument --       -- in your -- in your reply brief.       Would you call status -- if the test is where you spend a substantial amount of time working, is that what you call status?       You -- but you call that status?       That's what brings me -- I'm looking at petition appendix 96, 903(a) that you referred us to.     I wasn't quite sure of your argument with respect to this statute.     This statute is a situs-based statute.       But since Congress didn't follow this model in the -- in subsection (b) that we're looking for and used "as a result," why doesn't that show that Congress meant something different?     I didn't hear your argument on that point.       I don't see, in other words, how 903 doesn't hurt you more than it helps you.       But it doesn't; it talks about where the injury occurs, and that's not what -- and that's not what (b) says.
10-5258 +++$+++        In -- in the hypothetical where the penalty is increased, would there be an ex post facto problem?
10-5400 +++$+++        You have, in effect, a one-way ratchet.     If the judge really thinks rehabilitation is a -- a -- a primary or an important component of the sentence, then it reduces the prison term.     It could never increase it.     So you have a one-way ratchet.
10-5443 +++$+++        I don't -- I think Justice Alito can protect his own question, but I don't think you've answered it.     You've put in realistic likelihood. He's asked you whether or not as a matter of law, assuming that you're a juror and you read the statute and you were instructed on the words of the statute and you have Justice Alito's hypothetical, what result?       The reliability under the statute under Justice Alito's hypothetical.       All right.     Then Justice Alito's next question -- again, he can protect his own line of questioning -- but what does that have to do with realistic likelihood?     There's no realistic likelihood; it was only a half of 1 percent chance that the communication would be made.     So, that takes realistic likelihood off the table, and if it's off the table, you have to give us a different test.
10-545 +++$+++        Forties.       But it seems -- but it seems to me that that was rejected in our most recent -- an earlier case on copyright.       Yes.       Can you tell me a little bit about the phrase and the argument about the public domain?     Is, in your view, that just a synonym for when the time has ended?     Or is there something more substantive to it that -- is it your position that the public somehow owns what's in the public domain?     I'm --       But -- but how does the phrase -- so, the public domain is simply a conclusion to express that, the operation of that principle?     The public domain doesn't have any more substantive meaning other than to just express the conclusion that there's a limited time?       Once again, it's just a conclusion for the argument.       But now you're saying that there is a substantive component to this public domain argument, that the public does own something.     And that's different from what I thought you answered earlier when you said it's just conclusory for a limited time.
10-553 +++$+++        But here what we have is a claim of retaliation, so that she can't even get a hearing.     So, we can look at the various tests that are proposed here, and I think it's difficult to formulate the tests, but this can't even be -- be litigated because she is discharged.     The allegation is that there's a retaliation for even asking for a hearing where these tests could -- could be applied.       Again, that -- that could be an argument you could make in the -- in the pretext hearing.       But you're asking for an exemption so these issues can't even be tried.       It's almost like a summary -- like a summary judgment argument.       And that's the -- that's the analogy, I think.       No, no, no.     What she is saying is that you basically gave me summary judgment; you didn't allow me to go to the agency to have a proper test applied.     The summary judgment was just an analogy. Forget it. (Laughter.)       But I'm saying if there are some substantial interests the church has that can be litigated in EEOC hearing.     She was fired simply for asking for a hearing.       Lay people in many --       But the answer you gave to the Chief Justice seems to me to be this case.     I was interested.     I didn't know about this -- this minister capacity in this particular church.     And as the Chief Justice indicates, many churches don't have -- some churches don't have what we think of as professional or full-time ministers at all.     They're all ministers.       And you said, well, that -- that can be litigated, that can be investigated.     And I suppose when we do that we say, how many secular functions do you perform?     And that's what this case is. But you don't -- you don't even want that issue to be tried.     You say that issue can't even be explored.       While Justice Ginsburg is looking, I had -- I had the same impression, that whether you're commissioned or not commissioned doesn't necessarily mean you can't teach a religious class.       And again, that's something that -- that can be heard.     You don't even want to hear it.
10-568 +++$+++        The -- the -- the case is -- is presented to us with briefs that seem to pass in the night.     Your emphasis was on whether or not there was a right to vote that's protected under the First Amendment, and -- which is what the Nevada court held and you're quite correct to address it.     But the Respondent says:     Well, this interest has a chilling effect on -- on protected speech.     I think we have to reach both parts of that argument. Do you -- DO you agree with me?       Well, if we -- if we say that intermediate scrutiny is the test, even under that test, certainly under that test, the regulation cannot chill speech any more than necessary to fulfill the governmental interests, even under the intermediate standard.       And -- and it just seems to me it's difficult for it to just address the standard of proof without deciding the case.     Maybe you're right. Maybe we can just answer the -- the question that was certified and -- and send it back, if -- if you prevail. I'm not sure.       But the -- the objection to the statute on the grounds that it's vague doesn't go away simply because intermediate scrutiny applies, does it, assuming intermediate scrutiny?       Suppose that you spent your life in the civil rights movement or the right to bear arms movement or one or the other sides of the abortion debate, and these are your acquaintances, this is your -- it's been one of your principal activities, not for pay, but just because of your civic commitment. And then you are elected to the legislature and under this Nevada statute that controls, must you recuse whenever an officer of that association has -- is paid?       They have coffee together every morning and they're in the same book club.       It doesn't apply to outside advocacy?     It just applies to advocacy within the limits -       But even if you have a law which is not directed to speech and is directed at conduct which is not speech, that law is still - correct me if I'm wrong -- even under intermediate scrutiny, subject to invalidation if it has a chilling effect on -- on speech as an incidental matter, if that chilling effect is more than is necessary to accomplish the purpose of the statute.     Isn't that correct?
10-577 +++$+++        And that it's willful. And that it's willful.       That it's willful. Whoever willfully makes a false statement.       So, it's not correct.       Well, correct me if I'm wrong.     It would seem to me, just from reading the statute unless we have some gloss on, that if you think it's true but it's false, from the way you were indicating, would be a violation.     That's not the way I read it.     Now, have we said something other than that in later cases?
10-6 +++$+++        But didn't we take this case to determine whether or not deliberate indifference is the standard?     I mean, willful blindness -- I don't think an opinion for this Court has ever sustained. Santos was a judgment -- was not a majority opinion. That's just a subset of knowledge. If we leave that out from it, isn't the dichotomy that you present to us the difference between deliberate indifference and knowledge or -       -- or purposeful, culpable expression, the -- the Grokster standard?       I had thought that you wanted us to take the knowing standard in (c) and apply it to (b).       Correct me if I'm wrong.       And you say it's purposeful, culpable.
10-63 +++$+++        But he didn't have a mail drop?     I just didn't hear what you said.       Let me ask you --       Let me ask you this, if I may.     I don't know if -- I don't think the briefs covered it.     It may be in there.     Do you know, in Alabama and/or nationwide, in how many capital cases there is no appeal?       Well, in -- in this -- in this case, there was a direct appeal, and then there was this proceeding that we're talking about here.     The trial judge waited for 18 months.     So, you would think there's some merit to the underlying claim.     Any statistics on whether or not -- on how often an appeal is abandoned or not pursued in this kind of case?     No statistics?       I'm -- I'm aware of the allegations.
10-637 +++$+++        Let me ask -- let me ask this.     There was a second half of the Chief Justice's --   -- question that you never got to, but since we're on --       -- the GVR, I have one more question on the GVR, at least. If you had sought -- if you had been counsel -- you're not.     If you had been Greene's counsel and you had sought cert from this Court, you would have sought cert to the supreme -- the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, to the intermediate court, correct?       Which indicates that that is the decision that's -- that's involved here.     And once that decision becomes final, then you have a problem. If -- if the protocol or the practice or the rules had been that you would seek cert to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, then you might have had an argument about finality, but now you don't.     But you can get to that later, because the -- the Chief Justice had a second part of his question which was collateral.       And just to follow up on that question, the statute says it was "adjudicated," past tense, and the decision "resulted in," past tense.       You said -- you don't contend that -- what's --       You said you don't contend that, and I didn't hear -- was an unreasonable?     I just didn't hear it.       Yes.       Well, and, of course, those are ongoing injuries where the person continues to be confined.       I'm not sure there's an ongoing injury here.     All we're doing is talking about a trial error.     That's -- that's different than --
10-6549 +++$+++        I -- maybe I just don't grasp the core of the case then.     I thought this was a criminal conviction and that you were arguing that it's a criminal conviction because the conduct that's prohibited by the statute was conduct that covered this class of people by order of the Attorney General under the interim regs.     I mean, is that wrong?       I'm asking, isn't this is criminal conviction that resulted from the fact that your client was within the class of persons covered by the statute?     The Government says they're covered anyway.     You say they're covered only because the Attorney General acted, but then you say it's a criminal -- it's a civil provision?     I -- I -
10-680 +++$+++        Except when they say you have to leave, one way to interpret that or to analyze that might be to say:     You're in custody no matter.       And when you say you have to leave, that's almost coercion -- coercive of them to say, because he doesn't want to have to go back to the cell.       Right.       But I think it makes your case weaker, not stronger, that statement.
10-694 +++$+++        Well, a lot -- a lot of the statutory changes in the policies of the INS date back -- was it the Second Circuit's case in Francis, which talked about the equal protection component of the two classes comprised of those in exclusion proceedings and those in what were then called deportation proceedings? Do we just accept that?     It -- it seems to me that that whole equal protection rationale is quite doubtful.       So, if we thought that they had gone down the wrong path originally, there's nothing we can do about it, and we just say we're in this wilderness and we can't get out?
10-699 +++$+++        Well, under your -- under your theory -- and this is just following on Justice Ginsburg's question, I think.     Under your theory, what foreign relations determinations are for the President alone to make?       Are there any foreign relations determinations that are for the President alone to make under your theory of the case?       And those are?       In other words, who gets the telegram or something?       Is there any treatise writer or decision of this Court that supports such a narrow, crabbed interpretation of the President's foreign affairs power?       Of course -       -- in part the Jackson tripartite division, this famous division he had, I think assumes the validity of the congressional statute at the first step of inquiry.     And here that's the whole question.       But that wasn't a case - that wasn't a case in which the Congress had said you may not seize mills.     And that's what your case is.     So, there's a difference.       It -- it is if you assume that the statute is valid.       If the statute is -- if the statute is invalid, we're in category one.       Or two.       I have just -- I have just one question on -- on Washington's recognition of revolutionary France.     You cite in the reply brief the fact that the administration was simply following what it deemed to be a dictate of international law.     Do you want us to infer from that that he was not exercising a real discretion there?
10-704 +++$+++       In the background of this 2     case is -- is this question      I mean, that's -- I thought the Petitioner said -- I didn't have the time to 25     interrupt -- that under California law, they can search
10-708 +++$+++       I was going to ask you, 19     along that line, are there antitrust cases that -- that 20     Respondents or the Government could cite in which a 21     party can go into court alleging that the market has 22     been distorted, even though that person has no damage? 23     Anything like that in the antitrust -- what would be 24     their closest case?      There's not automatic 22     disgorgement in those --      Well, that -- that leads 25     me to this -- I thought -- I never thought of title insurance companies as being fungible, and some were 2     very, very good about narrowing the exceptions, about 3     working with the seller of the property, if you 4     represented the buyer, to get rid of the exceptions. 5     And so, I'm not sure that it's just a question of a 6     policy versus no policy.    There's a -- there's a quality 7     to the -- to the research they do. And the next -- and related to that is this: 9     You -- you put the case as if the price is going to be 10     the same for the insurance.    (A) I think there's nothing 11     in -- in the State law that permits the insurance 12     company to get -- to set a lower rate; and, second, 13     don't the title companies charge other fees, title 14     search fees and so forth, other fees in addition to the 15     price of the insurance?    And those other fees, arguably -- I know she didn't allege any damage -- but 17     those other fees arguably are too high because of this 18     fixed market.      Just following up Justice 11     Ginsburg's hypothetical, suppose the Congress works with 12     economists and concludes there is a reasonable probability that if there were no kickbacks, there would 14     be a more competitive market, there would be lower 15     prices for some of the escrow fees, some of the collateral fees in addition to the title insurance, and 17     the plaintiff then alleges that there is this reasonable 18     probability that there would be a more efficient market, 19     resulting in cost savings.    Would that be enough?      Well, the person alleges reasonable probability I could have had a lower price, 2     according to economic theory.      No, I'm assuming it's 7     alleged.
10-76 +++$+++        Again, this is preliminary, and it just goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question.     Suppose you could help me out.     I assume that there's general jurisdiction over the parent company. Then under respondeat superior, it would be liable in North Carolina for the -- all the acts of its agents.       Then why isn't it automatically liable for all the acts of its subsidiaries?       And -- and does that get -- and does that get into what in the Federal practice would be necessary parties?       I -- I was wondering why -- why is your interest in this case so much greater than it would be in -- in the other case, and this -- I've been wondering that at the outset, and this sentence that Justice Kagan points out brings that into full focus.
10-779 +++$+++        Could that data be sold to a university for research purposes?     The university says:     We really want this information to do some research.     Could the data be sold to the university for that purpose?       Could the researcher then have a profile, a data bank, that is very helpful to the general public, and sell that to the general public, to the newspapers and so forth?       No, no.     It's sold to the researcher.     The researcher then comes up with a design or database that is very fascinating for a number of reasons.     Can that researcher sell it to the New England Journal of Medicine?       I still am not - I still am not sure.     In my hypothetical, what would happen?       The pharmacy sells to the researcher.       The researcher is at the university.     The researcher has a data bank or has some results that are very fascinating.     The researcher then wants to sell that to the New England Journal of Medicine.     What result under the statute?       Well, I think maybe you're being -- you were the one that made the argument that the State has an interest in reducing health care costs. I assume that is by selling generics.     And the Chief Justice asked you a question:     In effect, aren't you doing this by regulating speech?     And you say no, you disagree.     I don't understand that answer that you gave to the Chief Justice.       But isn't this inconsistent with what you told the court of appeals?       So you -- you're representing to us that you told the court of appeals the statute should be interpreted as the SG is interpreting it here; that's your representation?       Well, that's because the pharmaceutical company deems this to be the most efficient.     What you're saying is that the State can prohibit the most efficient sort of speech, whereas if it just had general dissemination which didn't serve any particular purpose, that would be all right.       -- but if it becomes - becomes focused and important and effective, then the State can prohibit it.
10-788 +++$+++        Suppose an important witness is reluctant to testify but is issued a subpoena by the United States attorney to appear before the grand jury, and then with reluctance he comes forward but, under oath, provides all of the key testimony necessary to indict?     Is he a complaining witness?       Well, what's the test we're supposed to use to decide?       In the hypothetical I gave, what's the answer?
10-8145 +++$+++        The standard is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different, reasonable probability?       In looking at the appendix, there are some asterisks.     Were these statements, the first two -- the one at 252 in the joint appendix and then the statement on March the 2nd, which is the one you just referred to, 296, were parts of those statements given to the defense counsel or none of the statements?     And how long were the documents?     Were they 20 or 30 pages?     Can you tell me a little bit about that?       I shouldn't have said "statements."     None of the reports.       Can you just tell me, how does Brady work?     Is there some obligation for the defense counsel to say please give me all relevant reports?
10-844 +++$+++       I mean, we can ask the Government, but why did it think that it lacked the 2     expertise, because it didn't want to opine under the 3     patent laws?      Would it suffice in the 13     description just to give a cross-reference to the 14     patent, to say the use of this drug is described in 15     patent claim number 43?      Just one more question on 10     how this works.    Why does the FDA rely on use codes in 11     the Orange Book to make the carve-outs if it doesn't do 12     anything to ensure the accuracy of the code?      Yes.      So -- so, how do -- how do 22     you describe what the FDA does as your third -- 23                 MR. HORWICH rulemaking we're trying to do the best we can through 2     the administrative process to get good information in 3     the first instance.
10-8505 +++$+++       Abbinanti testified that 25     she did the blood test and it went into the State database with reference to the other crime, not this 2     crime; am I correct?      But she's an expert.    She 6     testified how she did the test and what the -- and that 7     she put the DNA result into -- into the data bank. 8                 MR. CARROLL Now, do you argue that those -- that that's 19     incorrect?    Those -- those statements cannot be 20     testified to as an -- by an expert without their 21     constituting either hearsay or testimony within the 22     meaning of the Confrontation Clause?      And she -- and she goes 6     further.    She says implication.    Based on that, which I believe to be true, 9     this belongs to Williams.    This DNA is Williams's DNA. 10                 And if she weren't relying on the truth of 11     the assertion from Cellmark, it would be irrelevant for 12     the jury.    Isn't that your point?      Well, you're -- you're 16     saying that the State of Illinois case is weaker here 17     than in Melendez, where they had a certificate, and in 18     Bullcoming, where they had somebody from the lab testify 19     as to lab procedures.    Here they have neither.    And, 20     yet, Illinois somehow says it comes in.      Are you aware that in 24     Illinois they have an instruction -- assuming it was a 25     jury case, this is a bench case, but if it were a jury case:    Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you are not to 2     presume or assume that the DNA tested by Cellmark came 3     from this sample.      And then they routinely 7     give that to juries?
10-875 +++$+++       Debts -- debts that were 7     incurred after that date?      But it says the estate -- 8     the estate's not liable for the tax imposed on the 9     partners.    So, if it's not liable, how can it ask for a discharge?
10-879 +++$+++ 
10-895 +++$+++        Can you -- can you make the argument -- does it help you, in distinguishing the notice of appeals section, to -- to say that the notice of appeal has to say the judgment or order that's being appealed? That's almost clerical.     It doesn't require any -- any discretion on the part of the judge or extensive review of the record, whereas in the COA, there has to be an element of judgment in deciding what the constitutional issue is.     Does that help you distinguish the two? You rely on the fact that the notice of appeals cases were decided before our -- our case indicating that it has to be clear language.
10-8974 +++$+++        In this case, suppose that the police talked to this -- to the lady that was in the -- in the apartment and saw the thing out the window and said:     We -- we think we've solved this case, but you can't look at this man.     We don't want to you look at this man.     Don't tell us.     We're not going to let you look out that window. It seems to me that the defendant might have a due process argument that the police interfered, that she couldn't say, right when he was there, that's not the man.     I don't know what you want the police to do in this case.     It seems to me it would have been (a) risking this argument from the defendant and (b) improper police conduct not to ask the woman, is this the man?       But, again, that was in the context of procedures that the police had instituted.       And your -- and your rationale goes much beyond it.     In a way, you're infringing on the province of the jury.     I don't usually like to reminisce, but there was a case I had where a prosecution witness was very, very certain, all too certain.     And I said:     Do you ever take your wife out to dinner or go out to dinner with friends?     And he said: Oh, yes.     I said:     Has it ever happened to you that midway in the meal you say, is that our waiter?     And you've seen -- the waiter has brought you the menu, he has taken your order, he has brought your food, and you were under no stress at the time. (Laughter.)       And there was good light. So, you teach the jury this way.     And you're just -- you're just usurping the province of the jury, it seems.       But we've said in our case, Neil v. Biggers -- that was a rape case, and we allowed it.     We allowed the eyewitness.       And, in fact, we said that it was unnecessarily suggestive but that it was still reliable.       Well, it seems to me --
10-930 +++$+++        How -- how would you define that standard?     What standard do you suggest?       And if it isn't solved after 9 months, then what?       If competency cannot be restored?       Based on the record.
10-945 +++$+++        Is the reasonable suspicion test more easily met if it's a felon detained for a serious felony?       In your -- in your view?       Well, then you are going on a case-by-case basis based on the offense.       But I take it -- I take it what we're trying to do is to protect the individual dignity of the detainee.     But it seems to me that you risk compromising that individual dignity if you say we have reasonable suspicion as to you, but not as to you. You're just setting us up, and you're setting the detainee up for a classification that may be questioned at the time and will be seen as an affront based on the person's race, based on what he said or she said to the officers coming in.       And so, it seems to me that your rule imperils individual dignity in a way that the blanket rule does not.       Well, I'm not sure if it's their rule or our rule.     Ultimately, it's going to be our rule.       A common?       Well, is the rap sheet always available immediately?     I thought it was rather common -- correct me if I'm wrong -- just based on practice some years ago, that it -- it would take maybe hours, 48 hours for the wiretap -- for the wire services and the Internet to -- to report that he was wanted for questioning for some very, very serious crime in some other State. I mean, in my practice at least, county jails were much more dangerous than penitentiaries, because you don't know who these people are.     You arrest them for traffic, and it may be some serial killer.     You do not know.       But you -- you would -       -- have to keep the person in custody, say, for 24 or 48 hours until the medical personnel could come.     Do you have 24-hour medical personnel for intakes that are at 2 in the morning?       You're telling us that every county jail in -- in the United States has medical personnel on duty 24 hours a day ready to do a -- a search?
10-948 +++$+++        In a standard arbitration agreement, if Smith and Jones agree to arbitrate and Jones then brings suit in court, and that action is then stayed pending arbitration, has there been a breach of the arbitration agreement simply by bringing the suit?       I mean, doesn't that happen rather often?       And, of course, suits are brought after arbitration to enforce the arbitration award.
10-9646 +++$+++        So, you're saying it would be unprincipled for us to say -- or at least unsupported for us to say -- that the sentence cannot be mandatory, but that in some cases, it might still be imposed.       If you take that off the table, then you leave us with nothing but saying that the sentence is never permitted or that it's always permitted.       That's difficult because the statistics show there are 2300 prisoners now under sentence of -- with life without parole for juvenile murders and they're -- that were committed under 18; nationwide.       So, it's very difficult to assess your answer to Justice Alito that, oh, the legislatures don't know about this.       If we can focus on the mandatory aspect of the case, I think -- I know you'd prefer a more general rule -- it may be that we have to have your general rule.     I'm not sure.     If I'm the trial judge, and I have to determine whether or not I'm going to give life without parole, and it's discretionary, what -- what do I look at?     Are -- can I get social scientists to come in and tell me what the chances of rehabilitation are?     Are there -- are there statistics? Now, we have some quite compelling stories of rehabilitation in this case.     I don't know if they're isolated; I don't know where they are in the statistical universe of how often rehabilitation is -- is demonstrated and is real.     What do I look at?     What's a judge supposed to do?       Well, again, it seems you're just forcing us into a -- a bipolar position. We're either going to say that you can't prevail at all or that everyone under 18 is -- cannot get life without parole.     I don't see this middle course --       -- which you seem to have abandoned, and you can't tell me how a judge would apply it if we -- if we chose not to abandon it.
10-98 +++$+++        What's your best authority that at -- at common law or the common law tradition, there is absolute immunity for witness -- for the issuance of witness warrants?       Then a second question, quite apart from immunity, just addressing the substantive constitutional issues under the statute, suppose that the prosecutor has probable cause to indict and try the person for the crime.     Suppose also that there is good reason to show that he would be a material witness as to another participant in the crime.     Does the government have any duty to proceed with the indictment, or can they just hold the person as a material witness without indicting?
10-9995 +++$+++  
105, Orig. +++$+++               Is 1911 a stand-alone provision that would justify relief for you, or do we have to also refer to the general cost statute?                Well, but let's assume that we think Congress can control this, this issue, this question.     Now, I'm asking if 911 isn't a stand-alone section so that you can interpret it without reference to 1920.                If I think this case is controlled by 1911, do I have to refer to 1920?                Why can't you rest your case just on 1911?                 Are you saying that 1911 doesn't cover expert witness fees because it's not included within the term "other necessary disbursements"?                 Were they within 1911?                 Other necessary disbursements.                 Incidental to the case. You don't that think that covers expert witness fees?              Well, but Justice Alito is saying we have discretion, we look for guidance, we have guidance from Congress.         They have adhered to the $40 a day limit in very important cases; why don't we just say, Justice Alito is suggesting, that this is -- that this is a good guidepost for us and we will follow it?              We are saying it's our discretion and our discretion is guided by what Congress has suggested so there is uniformity in the system and so forth.             How do Special Master fees work?   The Special Master always has fees and the parties I think usually divide them.                    How does that -- how is their authority to order them --             Well, I'm not sure that answer is -- is at all adequate.               Number one, what is there, as Justice Breyer pointed out, that's so different about this case? Let's say one landowner secretly and intentionally is stealing another landowner's water, and -- and he has no legal right to do that.                   And the only way the injured landowner can recover is to hire a very, very expensive expert, a hydrologist.                   And by the time he goes to court, he is really going to lose the benefit of the damages.   Congress has said too bad.                  That's the way it is. Why isn't it that way with States, especially, as Justice Breyer said, when States can really afford the -- afford it better than the landowner.   What's the difference?               Of course, I think you gave the answer earlier.          Rule 53 allows for the -- an order to say that one or both parties shall pay the special master fee.      So if we are going to follow other analogies, we don't have much problem here with expert witness fees -- pardon me -- with special master fees. It's under Rule 53. Of course, you say we don't have to follow that as a model, but it is a model if we -- if we were to look to congressional and -- and to other rules.
11-10189 +++$+++        How -- how do you want us to formulate the rule if we write the opinion in your favor?     If a State does not give a realistic opportunity -- a feasible means for expanding the record on direct review, then Martinez applies because it is the collateral proceeding that is the meaningful one -- and then we go through 50 States to see if that rule applies?       I'm -- I'm not sure exactly what Justice Ginsburg's formulation was, but I didn't -- I don't understand why you didn't say, oh, yes, that's right, there has to be one full fair opportunity to raise the issue.     And that's what we are arguing here.       Then the next -- then my question is:     Does this apply just to capital cases?       Could we in a -- oh.     So this doesn't apply just to capital cases, in your opinion?       And because of the rather sharp disagreements in the briefs on what the actual facts are here, I looked at the brief filed by the State Page 20 Bar of Texas in support of neither party. Can you tell me -- and that they are critical of having new counsel work simultaneously on a simultaneous timeframe concurrently with the -- with the new direct appeal counsel. Can you tell me how anything that's said in the Texas Bar briefs helps your case?       But what about -- what about the 75-day --       I understood that, if the -day rule had been complied with, within the 75 days, you can ask the appellate court to please remand because there is some additional evidence to be --       -- to be determined.       The statement?
11-1025 +++$+++        Is the test that you propose that the injury -- I think your brief used the word imminent -- is another way of saying that -- is it unfair to characterize the government's position as saying that you're submitting that the injury must be certain?       Well, let's assume -- let's assume for the moment that the lawyer would be -- that the lawyer would be injured if his communication with the client were intercepted, or at least that he would have standing to prove injury.     Let's assume that for the moment. If that is an acceptable premise, assume that it is, are you saying that it has to be certain to occur?     And another test is there's a reasonable likelihood, and then we get in the middle, is it a substantial likelihood.     You have to say -- you say imminent.       Certainly impending.       Is it -- you were talking -- you wanted to say there's a cascade of inferences, I think was your phrase.       You want to tell us that in your view these -- all these inference that we're required to go through, if the Respondents' theory is adopted, you were going to tell us about --       But you're -- you are saying that the government has obtained this extraordinarily wide-reaching power and we have extraordinary risks that face this country and the government's not going to use it.     That's just, it -- it's hard for me to think that the government isn't using all of the powers at its command under the law --       -- in order to protect this country.     And you -- you want to say:     Oh, well, don't worry that it's not happening.     There is another statute.     That -- that's the problem I have with this line of argument.       Well, it's Justice Kagan's hypothetical.     The lawyer -- and I don't forget about the -- I think the ethics problem is, is a very substantial one.     I think the lawyer would engage in malpractice if he talked on the telephone with some of these clients, given this statute.       But it's still the reality.     He still has to change his conduct.
11-10362 +++$+++        As a general matter, first in the States and then in the Federal Government, is a correctional officer or prison guard usually deemed to be a peace officer? Do you know?       I think it is true that there is a strong textual argument for your position. But let me ask this:     Are there any studies or any statistics we can look at to see as a predictive matter how many prison suits against the government this ruling that you propose would -- would cause?     It seems to me we have close to 200,000 Federal prisoners, I think, and this prison work, there is a lot of shoving, guards have to break up fights. So there is going to be any number of instances where the question is did the guard overreach. And if I make the assumption, and it's just an assumption because I haven't looked at any statistics, but there is -- this is going to vastly expand the number of cases in which the Government is the defendant.     Doesn't that bear on the likelihood of the congressional intent to adopt your position?
11-1059 +++$+++        Well, let me ask you this --       Let me ask you just this question -- just tell me as a matter of common practice, do district courts enter judgments against plaintiffs routinely when a full offer of settlement has been made and the defendant just is silent?     I mean, does this happen? I just can't remember seeing a -- but this --       It may -- it may be that it's common practice that, if the plaintiff doesn't reply and there's an offer that's filed with the court, the court says, I haven't heard anything, I'm going to enter judgment.       As a matter of housekeeping, you could --       Right.       Well, your -- your offer says, you hereby offer to allow entry of judgment under Rule 68.       But the -- but the question from Justice Alito was, what happens, does the court have authority to have a hearing?       And you said, oh, well, this is not under Rule 68; but -- but you offered to allow entry of judgment under Rule 68.       And incidentally, you never did follow up and say that you wanted an entry of judgment.     You just wanted a dismissal.     And that's another point.
11-1085 +++$+++        Are you saying that there -- are you saying that there is a difference between materiality for the fraud-on-the-market theory and for direct reliance or that there can be a difference?       And that if there was fraud on the market, that is a materiality question addressed at the certification stage, but if the class isn't certified, the investor can still show that he had had direct reliance that was reasonable?       Am I -- am I right about that?     Or --       Do the first part. (Laughter.)
11-1118 +++$+++        Let me -- me ask this question:     Suppose you have two cases, hypothetical, case A, case B, both involve the Experimental Use Doctrine in Federal patent law.     In case A, it's a very weak argument; it's most unlikely it's not going to apply.     Case B, very strong argument, Experimental Use Doctrine applies. Any difference in the removability in those two cases?       Well, if -- if you say -- since you're going to say it -- I mean, if it's a "substantial" Federal issue, then it's substantial in hypothetical B, but not in hypothetical A?      But can you just tell me,    as an -- as an empirical matter, does "arising under" for removal jurisdiction cases consume a tremendous amount of time in litigation in the Federal courts? It's just --      What I -- yes.    What I mean is the argument over "arising under" over jurisdiction.       So my question was even broader.     Let's say we resolve legal malpractice. Then -- then we will have products liability with a particular product, and then we will have some food and agriculture cases.     It goes on and on.
11-1160 +++$+++        Well, but to -- to follow the Chief Justice's question, suppose it were shown that there were many rural counties -- rural areas in Georgia, very much like this one.     Would that change this case?     I thought that was the purport of the -- the thrust of the question.       Well, I know Georgia has counties or something.       So I think they probably have many rural areas with one or two hospitals.     That's just a guess.
11-1175 +++$+++  
11-1221 +++$+++        In other words, they're preempted, but the whole purpose of the preemption can be thwarted.       But -- but quite apart from -- from that, it -- it seems to me that under your proposal the Congress would actually have accepted a situation where one spouse sues a former spouse.     In other words, you have a -- that's the whole design of this statute. Would the insurance company -- if you were representing the insurance company, would you tell the insurance company that they were completely safe in paying the benefits to the first spouse even if there's going to be a suit afterwards.       Or would the insurance company itself be under some liability?       That's the design of the statute.       But I'm just wondering whether under State law the insurance company, if it - if it knows this doesn't have some duty to refrain from making the payment or to put it in escrow or to interplead.       And if you're representing the insurance company, you wouldn't say you better interplead to be on the safe side?
11-1231 +++$+++ 
11-1274 +++$+++        Excuse me. Justice Ginsburg points out that you're talking about the statute, but the statute uses the term "accrual." Is it correct to say that the term "accrual" is not used in statute of limitations for crimes -- generally -- for crimes?       Right.     And this -- and this talks about accrual.     So that is indicative -- is indicative of the fact that Congress is using a civil analogue in the drafting of this statute.       In a civil -- in a civil action brought by an injured investor or private party, can that plaintiff, the injured investor, the private party, in the ordinary course plead and rely upon an earlier government determination that there had been a violation and so that that's presumptive showing of liability?       In other words, the SEC makes an investigation, finds a violation; can a private investor then rely on that as a presumptive showing of liability?       No, not the allegation. It's an ultimate finding.       But then under your rule. The plaintiff would be deprived of that.       But if the government's statute of limitations runs out and the private investor is on his own, then the private investor doesn't have the advantage that exists in other cases of reliance on a -- SEC finding as a presumptive showing of liability.
11-1285 +++$+++        I -- I recognize that we're talking about a matter of Federal law here.     What about the law of most of the States? Suppose there's an agreement with an insurer and an insured, that says the insured gets 100 percent of the proceeds.     I would think that the law of most States gives a superior lien to the attorney for the contingent fee, notwithstanding the agreement. I'm not sure of that.     It's just an assumption.       That -- that's the summary of the plan that's at A20.     That's not the plan --       Well, I mean, you -- you want us to decide a case without looking at the plan? I have before me the same language that I believe Justice Ginsburg is looking at, and I think she's quite correct, that the word "abrogation," of course, is not used, but neither is the concept.       Well, "simply because the plan language."     I mean, obviously, we have to look at the plan language to see what the -- you're -- you're relying on the plan language.     And you cite the summary, but you don't cite the main plan.       Justice Kagan's question had two parts.     She said, tell me about the two boxes, subrogation and reimbursement. I think there is quite a bit to your argument that this is not subrogation.     The plan is rather confusingly drafted.     The plan calls it subrogation.     I don't think it really means subrogation. If it's not subrogation, Justice Kagan's question was, what then?     The -- the common fund rule still does not apply?     Because?       But you are still in equity, pursuant to the statute.       And are you saying that there is no discretion in the equitable decrees that the judge made?
11-1327 +++$+++        But once -- once the judge determines, quite erroneously, that it has to be a dwelling -- midway during the trial, I'm the judge, I consider this has to be a dwelling, is there any way I can make that point, make that ruling, without invoking double jeopardy?       But -- but if I persist in that view, there's nothing the government can do?       What -- could a state provide a procedure where, if a judge makes a critical ruling mid-trial, that at the request of the opposing counsel, jury proceedings are suspended for 48 hours, and the aggrieved party can run to the court of appeals to get a mandate?       Because of?       Well, in my hypothetical, the state said -- and this isn't a final determination; the ruling doesn't become final until you have 48 hours and go to the court of appeals.       I'm not sure I understand the rationale for your answer to your own hypothetical. The judge characterizes a prosecutorial -- or a misconduct incident as a grounds for acquittal; it really isn't.     Then you said the court of appeals could straighten that out?       On what rationale -- so what's the general principle that allows the court of appeals to do this sometimes and not others?       Oh, I thought -- I thought it was the judge just subjectively does this, but he doesn't say any -- he just characterizes it as an acquittal?       Have any states done that? I -- I'm somewhat concerned about telling a judge that, if the judge's best judgment says there's insufficient evidence, that then it has to proceed with a trial.
11-1347 +++$+++        So have the State proceedings been dismissed?     Or are they in suspense?       So it would be your position that the Alabama courts still have jurisdiction over the child and the mother?       And would you go further and say that, if a stay is not in place, that that still does not deprive the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction to resolve the case on the merits?
11-1351 +++$+++        In law review commentaries and maybe in lower courts' opinion, is there -- is it fair to say that the weight of authority is to criticize the battery-negligence distinction as being productive of litigation and not really making a lot of sense?
11-139 +++$+++        Well, but -- but you're saying -- and I'm just trying to supplement Justice Scalia's question so -- so you can continue to answer it. You're saying that the split is somehow more obscure or more imprecise in its formulation than what Colony did.     You're saying that, oh, if Congress knew about Colony, they would have done it differently, but it was a split, this was close enough for government work.     That seems to be your argument.     And I -- (Laughter.)       I still don't understand why the world was different after Colony addressed the split than before Colony addressed the split.     The issue is still the same.       And what was -- and what was the date of that, Bakersfield?       Oh, okay.       Just on that point -- and we'll find out in a minute -- is the Respondent going to say, well, it's always implicit that you have a basis; everybody knows you have a basis?       So, that's -- so, that's necessarily what you're telling the government.
11-1425 +++$+++        If we are talking about reasonableness, do you think it's relevant for us to look to the rules and practices of other States?       But the fact that those States do have a warrant requirement and from what we can best tell make it work very well, including some expedited procedures where you can get warrants within minutes -- it takes usually the policemen, say, 20 minutes to get just to the hospital or the police station anyway.       But we have -- have always -- correct me if I'm wrong.     I think that we have always thought of Fourth Amendment reasonableness standards as being a national standard.     Suppose 40 States -- you know, we can play the game.     Suppose 40 States had rules that you have warrants and many of them had expedited procedures.     That's still irrelevant?     We don't look at that at all?       Is there any showing that conviction rate in those States is lower than in the States where the practice is -- is to take the test without the warrant?       Well, we have -- I don't want to because you have multiple answers -- but on that point, we do talk about exigent circumstances.     If -- if we proceed as Justice Ginsburg's suggestion indicates, then the fact that you can't get a warrant within minutes is the exigent circumstance.       But Justice Ginsburg said minutes.       I thought -- I thought that we often said that you look at whether or not you can get a warrant before you can break in so that the drugs aren't flushed down the toilet and so forth.     We make that judgment all the time.       And if that showing is not made, you must get a warrant.       So I think it's quite incorrect to say that we -- we don't look at the time factor.       We look at it all the time.       I agree that there is a uniform standard.     But -- and I don't know if you ever did finish the answer to Justice Ginsburg, but she -- she had suggested that we have a uniform rule of exigent circumstances.     That -- her suggestion complies with your objection.       Now, I think you should be fair.     He doesn't have to prepare a written affidavit in a number of these States.     It's a telephonic warrant. You have to give us that.       Incidentally, it wasn't clear to me:     Is that 1 hour from the time of the -- pardon me -- two hours from the time of the stop or two hours from the time he put him in the back of the patrol car?     Do we know?
11-1447 +++$+++        Suppose the district did -- did have, as I think it did here, a uniform policy that, for every acre you develop, you have to preserve 10 wetlands -- 10 acres of wetlands. And then two cases, both hypothetical, one is somebody had an 100-acre parcel, and they want to develop five acres, and they have 50 acres that they mitigate for wetlands.     The other person has only one acre, and he wants to -- and he has to develop the whole acre. Can the district then say, we'll give you the one-acre development permit, if you reclaim wetlands on 10 other acres that you -- that we can designate for you elsewhere?     The hypothetical being designed to point out whether or not the crux of your argument is that he had to go off -- offsite.       So, in my hypothetical, you would -- would there be a violation in my hypothetical, as you understood it?       I -- I have one question. I know we -- you are running short on your rebuttal time. Assume that, when we look at this record, assume we think there is a due process violation, not a taking violation.     That is not before us here, is it?
11-1450 +++$+++ 
11-1518 +++$+++        I -- I assume the other children did not have an interest in the business, but just the trustee and the mother did.     Or is that clear from the record.       The briefs -- the briefs on your side of the case say, well -- you know, there is a series of words here:     Fraud, defalcation, embezzlement, larceny. But really, fraud and defalcation are defined in a further way where embezzlement and larceny are not.     Fraud and defalcation, while acting in a fiduciary capacity, then embezzlement and larceny. So I'm not quite sure it's there to say that all four words must be consulted for the use of generous because fraud and defalcation are qualified by "in a fiduciary capacity" and then a comma.       Yes.     In that respect, I think the word "fraud" gives you some assistance in arguing your case.
11-1545 +++$+++        Are there some statutes where parts of the statute are subject to the agency's Chevron rule-making authority and its zero plus one jurisdiction and other parts are not?     You just mentioned the case by Justice Scalia -- and I'm not sure that that involved that because it does seem to me, just reading through, that "reasonable time," that sounds like something that -- where we can have a specific elaboration of what it means. And to say that the jurisdiction of the agency or the authority of the agency does not extend to rules seems a little odd at first.     I recognize the federalism problems and so forth.       And could you add that, in those three cases -- or at least Meade, some respect was given to the agency's due?       It was just not the sort of deference that's so wooden under Chevron.       And you might also have said, it seems to me, that that assumes the issue -- assumes the premise.       The question is, is there jurisdiction or not?       If you say, when there is no jurisdiction, why do you give deference, that -- that assumes the very step -- the very question we are trying to resolve.       Well, I wouldn't know when to go to court.       Let me -- let me ask you this:     Suppose there is a provision of this statute which is very difficult to understand.       Does that bear on the Chevron Step Zero analysis on the question of what you call jurisdiction?       All right.     It seems, to me, that Justice Ginsburg identifies a real point.     I was looking at this statute, and I say -- you know, how do I know when this agency has failed to act?     I don't -- that's a very obscure data point.       Was that at 209?       Chevron is at an end. It's unravelled.
11-159 +++$+++        Would you tell me if -- if the Capato twins are both found to be -- be children within the meaning of the Act, will they meet the dependency or the deemed dependency requirements?     Or is that a back-up argument that you have?     Or --       You don't have a position on that here?     Or -- you want that to be elaborated more by the agency?
11-161 +++$+++        Can you tell me -- I'm curious to know, if other States have provisions like the Barrett Law and they're concerned about this, can they provide in the initial documents a -- a promise that there will be no forgiveness, so that there would be a contract clause sort of argument against what happened here?     In other words -- and if we could explore that for just a minute, I'm going to ask what it is that you thought constituted a promise in this case.       And maybe not a promise in the contract sense.       On the other aspect of my case, do you think other States could provide protection against this, in the event you do not prevail here, and -- and put in the documents that it is understood that a condition for your approving of this, these sewers, will be that there will be no forgiveness?       Would that then be enforceable under the contract clause, do you think?       Give you a warning?
11-166 +++$+++  
11-182 +++$+++        Suppose it takes two weeks to make that determination, can the alien be held by the state for that whole period of time --       -- just under Section 6?       What -- what would be the standard?     You're -- you're the attorney for the -- the alien, he -- they are going to hold him for two weeks until they figure out whether this is a removable offense.     And you say, under the Fourth Amendment, you cannot hold for -- what?     More than a reasonable time or --       But, I think --       I think Justice Scalia's question was the -- was the broader one, just as a theoretical matter.     Can we say -- or can -- do you take the position that a state must accept, within its borders, a person who is illegally present under Federal law?       And that is by reason of his alien --       Would you agree that -- would you accept, as a working hypothesis, that we can begin with the general principle that the Hines v. Davidowitz language controls here, and we're going to ask our principal -- our primary function is to determine whether, under the circumstances of this particular case, Arizona's law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress? Is -- is that an acceptable test from your standpoint?       But -- but then the government on this section is going to come and say, well, there may be -- this must be -- this -- the enforcement of this statute, as Arizona describes it, will be in considerable tension with our -- with our basic approach; isn't that what I'm going to hear from the government?       Would --     double prosecutions be -- suppose that an alien were prosecuted under Federal law for violating, basically, the terms of 3.     Could the states then prosecute him as well?
11-184 +++$+++        I've probably led a charmed life, but I've never heard of mixed case until this matter came before us.     And I was -- I suppose you have to adopt the phrase, but the statute 7703 just say "cases," "cases of discrimination," which is what this is. We don't usually think of cases that we call a discrimination case based on whether or not it contains other issues.     It's a case.       I mean, I think that helps you.
11-192 +++$+++        But is this a money-mandated statute?
11-199 +++$+++        My problem --       -- is I can accept that formulation certainly for purposes of this case.     I just don't see where in the opinion -- I have the opinion of the court of appeals -- it focused on the wrong test. It didn't use the magic words, and it started out with let's look at the big picture, and it said, well, here's the defense he elected to put on, and this is a tough sell because.     But then it quotes what happens with the jury.     It -- and it -- and it ends its analysis for -- saying:     We -- this evidence would have moved the jury to convict Vasquez without a nudge from anything it heard in the government's case. I just -- I just don't see that you have supported your theory by what the -- by what the court says.       Where -- where is that statement?     Where is that statement?       Yes.       But -- but in the context of the opinion -- and this was my first question -- they then proceed to analyze -- and that's toward the very end of its discussion -- what happened in this particular case.     And it concludes, from this evidence we believe -- "This evidence we believe would have moved the jury to convict."       Is your argument something like this?     Let's assume there are 10 pieces of evidence.     Evidence 1 through 9 are properly admitted. Evidence item 10 is (a) wrongfully admitted and (b) so prejudicial that that's all the jury looked at.     There is a substantial likelihood of that. I think this is your argument:     If the jury was so obsessed, focused, transfixed by item 10, which was improperly admitted, what would happen if we concluded that this jury in this case on these facts, if they had looked at 1 through 9, would have convicted? What result?       We're not only saying it's possible to convict, but that likely, probably would have happened.       No, my hypothetical is that the court of appeals says that if the jury had looked at 1 through 9, which was properly admitted before them in this trial, they would have convicted, likely. Now, we -- then the hypothetical is:     We don't think they did because this item was so prejudicial that all they looked -- that's all they looked at.     Is that what your argument is?     It seems to me that's stronger than the argument you're making.     I'm not sure even that works for you.
11-204 +++$+++        And these are all -- these are all within the Fair Labor Standards Act?       Are there any occupations or pursuits that are not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act because -- on the rationale that they are out, that they are unsupervised, and so forth.     In other words, if you were arguing the case of the Respondent, would you -- would you have any close analogies to areas that are not -- that are exempt; in other words, they wouldn't be salesmen, but there'd be some other classifications to fit them in?       And it's gone on for years, and you're -- and instead of doing a regulation, amended regulation, as Justice Breyer indicates, you're filing amicus briefs quietly in different -- different courts.     It seems to me that's not nearly as fair or straightforward or as candid as -- as an agency ought to be.       But the district court here made a finding -- this is at 42a of the appendix for the Petitioners:     "Sales volume is directly and exclusively driven by the number of prescriptions written by physicians, and plaintiffs' job was to encourage such prescriptions."
11-210 +++$+++        Well, I'm -- I'm not sure that that's quite correct.     It has said it often but always in context where it is well understood that speech can injure.     Defamation, Gertz -- page 12 of your brief, you make this point, and it's what Justice Sotomayor is indicating.     You think there's no value to falsity. But I -- I simply can't find that in our cases, and I -- I think it's a sweeping proposition to say that there's no value to falsity.     Falsity is a way in which we contrast what is false and what is true.       And -       But that's in the context of a defamation case.       And you want to take the Gertz case, where it's well understood that defamation is actionable, and say that as a general matter, that the government can inveigh against what's false.       But that's -- that's for submitting rsums.     That's -- when -- that's fraud.       They were -- they were in a context, though, of recognized torts, intentional infliction for emotional distress.     Here it does seem to me that you can argue that this is something like a -- a trademark, a medal in which this -- the government and the armed forces have a particular interest, and we could carve out a narrow exception for that.     I think we'd have to do that. But just to say that the cases you mentioned say that there's no value to false speech, I just simply cannot agree that they stand for that broad proposition. They do in the particular context of a recognized tort like intentional infliction of emotional distress.       It seems to me your best analogy is the trademark analogy, Olympics case, et cetera.     You put that in a rather minor -- not an afterthought, but it's a secondary argument in your brief.     It seems to me it's the -- it's the strongest one. The whole breathing space thing almost has it backwards.     It presumes that the government is going to have a ministry of truth and then -- and allow breathing space around it.     I just don't think that's our tradition.     On the other hand, I have to acknowledge that this does diminish the medal in many respects.       My -- my only -- one of my questions is the slippery slope problem, college degrees and so forth. Could you address that?       But -       College degrees.
11-246 +++$+++        On what date was it -- on what date was it clear that the use would be gaming? There is some suggestion in the briefs that, oh, well, it could be light industry and it was zoned for economic use generally.     At what point was it acknowledged by all that this would be for gaming?     At the very outset?       At the very outset.       Well, then your -- your argument is just one of timing and not the fact that the reliance is on the -- is on the QTA. The tribe says, isn't it ironic that if you really have a claim in the land as a property owner, you can't sue under the QTA, and this person is much further removed.     Well, that's because he has a different ground for relief.     That's all we're talking about.       So the fact that the QTA suddenly, deus ex machina, pops onto the scene doesn't mean that it -- that that changes his -- his ground for relief that he's -- that he's relying upon.     His ground of relief has always been the same, APA.       Mr. Miller, one -- one question, if -- if I may.     The government takes the position -- at least this was the way the Respondent puts it -- that it can basically moot their action by turning this into a quiet title action just by taking title.     And let's assume that that's one characterization of your position.     And the Respondent on the other hand says, oh, well, this is an APA action, we can -- we can wait forever, at least for 6 years. Is there some midway position that the government can't moot the case too soon, that it must wait a reasonable time?     Or is there no basis in the statute or in the cases for that position to hold?       Yes, yes.       Well, in other words, you're -- you're sticking with your position.     You say you can basically moot a suit at any point you want just by taking title, so you're -- you're not accepting any qualification to that proposition.       All or nothing?     Okay.
11-262 +++$+++        There's just a little bit of noise in the courtroom, and I'm -- I have a little bit of difficulty hearing your very opening statement.       Yes.     Yes.       Does your rule apply regardless of the degree of animus that the agent is alleged to have had as to the particular view being expressed?       You might apply the same immunity for selective enforcement based on race?       Yes.       Well, I'm aware of the reservation in Whren.     Why should there be a difference in the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection and First Amendment speech?
11-338 +++$+++        Am I correct or incorrect that a considerable number of these roads are -- a significant number of these roads were built initially by the logging industry?       And it's a little hard for you to say that, when these were built by the logging industry and presumably maintained to some respect by the logging industry, to say, oh, well, these are used by hunters and so forth.     I -       Is it your submission that we should issue an order vacating this moot or issue an order for the court of appeals to consider whether it's moot?       What is your submission?
11-345 +++$+++        And this was -- and this was before the adoption of the plan.       Could you comment on this -- and then I hope we can get back to Justice Alito's question. You argue that the University's race-conscious admission plan is not necessary to achieve a diverse student body because it admits so few people -- so few minorities.     And I had trouble with that, reading the brief.     I said, well, if it's so few, then what's the problem?       Then -- let's assume --       -- that it resulted in the admission of many minorities.     Then you'd come back and say, oh, well, this is -- this shows that we -- we were probably wrongly excluded.     I --       I see an inconsistency here.       Is it -- are you saying that you shouldn't impose this hurt or this injury, generally, for so little benefit; is -- is that the point?       Well, perhaps you could summarize by saying -- by telling us, from your point of view, this plan fails strict scrutiny on one or two or both levels, A, because the objective is inappropriate or ill-defined, and, B, because of the implementation is defective.     Which or both of those are you arguing?       And in what respect does this plan fail strict scrutiny under either of those -- under both of those categories?
11-393 +++$+++        But I'm still not sure, what is the test -- and this was a colloquy you had with Justice Scalia with the Cornhusker hypothetical.     I need to know what standard you're asking me to apply.     Is it whether as a rational matter the separate parts could still function, or does it focus on the intent of the Congress? If you -- suppose you had party A wants proposal number 1; party B wants proposal number 2. Completely unrelated.     One is airline rates; the other is milk regulation.     And we -- and they decide them together.     The procedural rules are these have to be voted on as one.     They are both passed.     Then one is declared unconstitutional.     The other can operate completely independently.     Now, we know that Congress would not have intended to pass one without the other. Is that the end of it, or is there some different test? Because we don't want to go into legislative history, that's intrusive, so we ask whether or not an objective -- as an objective rational matter, one could function without -- I still don't know what the test is that we're supposed to apply.     And this is the same question as Justice Scalia asked.     Could you give me some help on that?       And which one -- and what test do you suggest that we follow if we want to clarify our jurisprudence?       And that objective test is what?
11-45 +++$+++        What --       -- what would happen if -- if the employee is fired because of his or her religion and he goes to MSPB?       And this is a First Amendment claim.     MSPB has to say, well, this is not adequate cause, and -- and then they find something else in the statute?     It can't look at the constitutional aspect of the claim?       Because he gave a -- a speech --       -- saying there's no global warming or something.       But the MSPB says we can't look at the First Amendment?       What I'm asking --       But I -- I was leading up to the fact, why should there be a difference?     If the MSPB has this expertise in as-applied, why doesn't it have it for facial?     I mean, the expertise question is -- it can't be a matter of expertise; or am I wrong about that?
11-460 +++$+++        What page again?       Suppose that the district has 85 percent of the water by volume that's put into this river, and then you have this high pollution index. Does that make it an easier case for the challengers? Or is that just irrelevant?       I have one different question.     This is hypothetical.     It's not in the case. It's just for me to understand that. Suppose you have the river, and part of it is a concrete bank, and then there's a more natural bedding and then another concrete bank. And when the -- in the dry season, they fix the concrete bank, but they use bad concrete.     And a lot of pollutants are coming out of the concrete, but it is in the river.     Is that a discharge under this statute?       Would there be any --       And that's -- that's a separate provision of the statute, nonpoint source pollutions.       Well, that's not in this case.       It was just a background, background question for you.   Circuit's error -- was the Ninth Circuit's error here a factual one, because it was based on the location of the stations?     Or was it a legal one because it misinterpreted our Miccosukee case?       Is it your position that the rivers -- the two rivers in question are outside the MS4?     I thought there was a suggestion in the government's brief that you could have both the river and the MS4 that could cover the same area.
11-465 +++$+++        Well, we can continue and probably should talk about this broad theory that you want us to adopt. Really, in this case, the court of appeals in -- in the state system cited Nesler, and Nesler in turn cited, at page 104 of the petition appendix, a Supreme Court case you don't even -- you say citation, you don't even give -- but it -- it's -- it's the Supreme Court case, United States v. Wood, written by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes.     And it seems to me its very clearly ties its state analysis to the Federal Constitution and a Sixth Amendment discussion in Wood. So it seems to me that you're -- you have a very strong argument that they did adjudicate the Federal claim anyway.     I know you want us to maybe reach the bigger issue, but -- and your brief almost downplays it -- but it seems to me pretty clear that you have the argument, that you don't strongly make, although you don't, by any means, abandon it, that -- that here the state law was tied to the Federal standard, and the Federal standard was the basis for the entire jurisprudence.       Well, suppose that the --       Well, I suppose -- I suppose the broader rule, if you took $28.52 out of the State's judicial budget and bought them all a stamp which just says, we have considered and rejected all constitutional claims, then there would be no problem?       Well, I have to -- I mean, this takes us into the merits, which is really interesting, but I -- we probably shouldn't go there, but, as long as we're there for a minute, I agree with Justice Ginsburg.     I've never seen a procedure like this. And I looked -- I looked at this -- the Federal cases, Brown and Thomas, that the Cleveland court cited.     Those -- and Wood was voir dire, was not mid-jury. I just hope this doesn't happen with much regularity.     And the fact that the trial judge is upset, that's the reason that you should leave the jury alone, it seems to me.     I think it's very troublesome.
11-551 +++$+++        All within the -- all within the dollar amount that was specified by the Congress in the "not to exceed" language.       I had exactly the same question.     The "not to exceed" language, which I think is the word, "not to exceed," hasn't been mentioned by you yet because -- maybe you haven't had time.       But -- but I thought that was what Judge Dyk said --       -- was the critical -- the difference between this and even the Cherokee case.       And so my question is -- is the same as Justice Ginsburg's.     Isn't a principal part of your argument that this contract said not to exceed, and then the sums differ from year to year, but let's say $95 million?       When the Congressional Budget Office, or whatever agency it is that figures out whether there's a deficit and, if so, of how much, do they look at "not to exceed," and do they take that amount seriously?     Or --       But the -- but the position of the Respondents is that it makes no difference.      So Congress is saying nothing at all.       I take it the Respondents' position is that the contracting officer says, now, this is going to go over the not to exceed amount, but not to worry, just sue us under the Judgment -- just sue us under the Judgment Act.
11-556 +++$+++        Well, if you adopted that rule I suppose you could couple it with an increased duty of care on the part of the employer to take necessary steps to prevent forbidden harassment.     In other words, you up the duty of care on the part of the employer generally.
11-564 +++$+++        I mean, that just can't be a proposition that we can accept across the board. Nobody under that view has an interest in contraband in their home.     The question is, can you find out the contraband?     It's just a circular argument. And if -- and in the -- was it the Caballes case that talked about that, if I have the right name? That was where the contraband was visible; it was almost like the smoking gun falls out.     Well, of course, there's no interest in the smoking gun when it falls out in front of you.     So I just don't think that works.       I just -- again, as I told Mr. Garre, I just can't accept that as the premise for the case.     The argument we're having about whether there is a reasonable expectation in society generally, whether or not the police because of limited resources are not going to have -- that's all fine.     But this idea that, oh, well, if there is contraband, then all the -- all the rules go out the window, that's just circular, and it won't work for me, anyway.       Fine --       -- but don't ask me to write an opinion and say, oh, we're dealing with contraband here, so we don't need to worry about expectation of privacy.     There is simply no support for that because Caballes cited Jacobsen, and Jacobsen was where the contraband fell out of the package and it was in plain view.     So that just doesn't work, at least for me, in this case.       Again, I don't think the cases go that far because those were cases in which the contraband -- Jacobsen -- was in plain view.     Everybody knows that it falls out of the package.     At that point, you don't have any -- What you're saying is, oh, well, if there is contraband in the house, then you have no legitimate expectation of privacy.     That, for me, does not work.       That's fine.     We can talk about reasonable suspicion.     That's all okay.
11-5683 +++$+++        Well, on your statement that the -       -- one Congress cannot bind a later Congress, do you mean we're not supposed to look at 109?     We're not supposed to look at the Dictionary Act?       So, then -- so, then the fact that 109 is on the books is relevant.     And -- and it's not a question of one Congress binding the other. It's a question of what the second Congress did.       Well, so then we -- we ignore the Dictionary Act?       And we ignore 109?       Well, why doesn't it - why doesn't that bring us right back to what 109 says?
11-597 +++$+++        I guess what we're asking you is, how do you define the baseline of protected expectations for the property?       You've indicated, I think, in your brief that one year won't do it.     This was six or seven years. If that's a baseline of expectations, the Government cannot change that, even if it thinks that there is a higher and -- and more urgent priority in protecting some other land?       But my question is how do you define the baseline that gives a legitimate expectation, if the Corps of Engineers -- did not happen in this case, but in the hypothetical case -- makes the finding that there is a more urgent and -- and a higher priority for other lands, and it changes its policy?     It cannot do that?       Well, what you're saying is that it can't make that change without paying, right?       Now suppose, at the very outset of the dam, the -- the Government says, we've got to put this water someplace, we're going to put it on the left bank, not the right bank.     That's not a taking as of that time --       -- if the land was always flooded anyway on the right?       But what I want is the definition of the operable baseline that we can use in order to define whether or not there has been a taking.       Well, the question is what do we say to the circuit?     What do you want us to tell the circuit to do on remand?
11-626 +++$+++        Well, but in -- in your brief, I really lost count, but I think it's six times on the first two pages, you talk about indefinitely moored. Now, the facts are in dispute, and we're not quite clear of the facts, but let's assume that this magnificent structure is -- which was mercifully destroyed -- let's assume that it was attached to the dock by a rope, a garden hose and an extension cord, and that it could leave within 30 minutes notice.     Is that indefinitely moored?     And if the answer is yes, is that because of subjective intent of the owner?       But suppose --       -- you know the law school game, suppose it was moved every month.       That would be indefinitely moored, in your view?       But it was still -- it was still tied to the land with roads and ramps and so forth.     Here you've got the hose and the extension cord and the rope.       And it seems -- and it seems to me, suppose you -- you want us to make some universal definition of we know what a floating home is. Suppose this -- suppose there were -- another owner of a structure like this, and it moved to a different slip every week to get more shade or more wind or something. Then that would be different?       And suppose it moved -- suppose it moved up and down the canal to get better or worse weather during different seasons.       Well, I have the same problem Justice Kagan says.     The whole point is that it can move.     That's the whole -- that's the reason you have it.       On the first question, purpose or function, what did they know that we can't know by looking at this picture and listening to these arguments?       I mean, I would be willing to stipulate they are better at this than we are, but let's -- let's assume.       I want to be fair to the Court of Appeals, well, now, you tell us what the purpose and function is.       Don't we know that?
11-681 +++$+++    Is there any likelihood that the union that represents these -- what do I call them -- healthcare workers, health providers -- care providers, is there any likelihood that they would try to bargain for benefits for these -- these workers?   Yes, yes. Is there any likelihood? Do we know anything about what the likelihood would be for certain subjects to be brought up in the bargaining with the State?   Well, but, I mean, I suppose there could be labor peace if the Respondents were to prevail. I mean, that -- that assumes that your theory of the case is going -- is going to prevail.   I mean, doesn't the -- isn't there labor peace -- let's assume that's a valid interest -- isn't there labor peace if one union represents these healthcare providers and makes and negotiates a contract with the government?   Well, why doesn't it? It -- it gets the demand from the union, it recognizes it's reasonable; that's the policy, and then it can move forward with the policy.   Suppose the Court were to say that on the issue of salaries there is no First Amendment violation, that -- that Abood should remain applicable to public employee unions. Are there other issues that public employee unions necessarily raise in collective bargaining that raise other concerns about governmental policies that union members might disagree with?
11-697 +++$+++        The government argues in effect for -- what we might call it -- a common law adaptation of Bobbs-Merrill.
11-702 +++$+++        It's -- it's a massive amount of conduct that -- that the statute contemplates? The statutory scheme -- I just didn't hear.     I just didn't hear.       Again, I didn't hear.       They want to do it in every --       At the -- at the beginning of the State prosecution?       All right.       Would it -- would it be permissible -- I had the same question.     Would it be permissible --       Or would you be back up here saying that this violates the statute?       Do you have any statistics -- if you take the whole universe of convictions under the Georgia statute, what percentage of them are for these minor offenses and what are for the major?     Do we have any handle on that at all?
11-713 +++$+++        Just one more question.       Background question about preclearance.     Assume that the court of appeals -- that the three-judge district court in Columbia in the preclearance proceeding finds some problems with two or three of the districts, say, in the congressional plan. Does it just say we -- there are problems with these districts, we therefore deny preclearance; or does it then give guidance and say we would give preclearance if you made the following changes?     Does it -- in other words, does it give you a road map?     How do these decisions work?     That's what I'm asking.       At face value.     But you don't have any problem -- if I'm a district judge and I think there is a substantial likelihood that a particular challenge will succeed, you don't have any problem with my drawing an interim plan to avoid that likelihood.       Thank you.       Section 2.       Can you -- can you tell me with reference to the two districts, other than the senate district, congressional and State house districts, did Judge Smith defer or use the -- the Texas legislature's 2011 plan as a benchmark to some extent?       So, you would fault his solution for giving insufficient deference to the State of Texas 2011 plan?
11-770 +++$+++        If -- if you think that leaving the scene -- in Justice Kagan's hypothetical, that he's leaving the scene with incriminating evidence, at that point you have -- you have a Terry stop?     And he's right at the scene; he's just leaving the premises, at the end of the driveway or something?       What would you think generally in my hypothetical?     There'd be hundreds of other facts, but --       Just -- just before the search, yes.       Right.
11-796 +++$+++        Well, I think you may be right in the way you characterize Monsanto's argument, and I have great difficulties with characterizing it that way, as Justice Scalia's question indicates.     But Monsanto can still prevail if you say that there's a patent infringement, if he plants it for seed and uses the seed to replant.     That's not as far as Monsanto goes, but it seems to me it's one way to characterize their argument and to make it sensible.       I have only one question so far, it's a farming question.     With some crops if you are going to make seeds, you leave the crop in longer.     In -- what about soybeans?     If the farmer has the north 40 and the south 40, the north 40, he's going to plants soybeans to be used for flour, human consumption, and south 40, he wants seeds.     Does he leave the plants in the ground the same amount of time?       You would not?     Okay.       But that's -- if you're going to use the soybeans for seeds as opposed to flour, do you leave them in the ground any longer?       Okay.       Please correct me if I am wrong.     I thought that's exactly what Bowman did here. He went to a grain elevator and he -- he used the seeds, and -- and he didn't know exactly the percentage mix, but he used them.       So he did exactly what you said is uneconomical.
11-798 +++$+++        Is it part of your argument that the city contracts with the port and then the port contracts with the truckers, but at that point, the ports are -- are confined in what they can do? There can be really no bargaining between the ports and the truckers based on what the city has already told the port?
11-817 +++$+++        And judges do this thousands of times in thousands of cases.     They ask: Was the tip reliable?     There are any number of permutations.     It's a question of whether or not the trial judge was -- made a correct determination in determining that there was or was not sufficient cause for the police to proceed.     It just happens every day.
11-820 +++$+++        Well, suppose that a really skilled attorney, after negotiating a plea bargain, or even representing a client at trial but then losing, is very skilled in ensuring that the defendant can go into the general population, not into solitary confinement; but also a skilled trial attorney, he's just not very good at that, so the defendant goes to solitary. Could -- if there was an evolution of the law of adequate assistance of counsel so that this Court later held, oh, conditions of confinement have to be a part of the attorney's -- skill and competence in representation, that that would be retroactive?       So that there are then, in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, some cases in which there could be a new rule of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland?       Well, I don't understand how that works with my hypothetical.       Well, it just seems to me that the predicate question that we decided in Padilla was that Strickland applies to matters not within the control of the trial judge.     That it seems to me was a holding the Court had not addressed before and that other courts had not addressed before.       No, this is --       -- a predicate question.       Do you want us to write this opinion in support of your position, and to begin by saying, prevailing professional norms do not change?       It seems to me that you're -- that the defense bar generally would want to say that prevailing professional norms change, but that -- that hurts you in this case.       I notice -- I'm not sure it was cited in the brief, but the ABA comment in 1999 said, now the ABA standard applies to professional standards, and that goes beyond the constitutional minimum.     So that doesn't seem to me to help you, either.       It said, it should be stated that these standards do more than enforce the constitutional minimum.       Well, I'm talking about the -- I'm talking about the ABA here, if you want to give some other authority; but, I say that, it seems to me, does not help you.       Well, except -- except that -- and I'm interrupting, in a sense, but it's on the same track -- except that it seems to me that Teague does serve the interest of repose, quite apart from interference with a federal proceeding, and that interest is surely sacrificed by the holding you wish us to make here.       Perhaps on rebuttal -- I recognize the white light's on -- you could address what is -- what is the standard you want me to apply to determine retroactivity?     The brief says, oh, well, it's just new facts applying to the same general rule.     Well, danger invites rescue; the assault on privity is proceeding to pace; MACPherson v. Buick and the Erie Railroad case -- it seems to me that those were probably new rules, but there -- it's because the facts told us what should be negligent.     If at some point you could address that, I don't --
11-864 +++$+++        I did -- are there cases in the -- in the ordinary course of class actions -- I know they are all different -- where the district court can find that common questions do predominate, without addressing the question whether damages can be proven on a class-wide basis?     Or are they always interlinked?
11-88 +++$+++ 
11-889 +++$+++        It's -- it's my understanding that there is a place where Texas can put a line into the river, and then a subset of that question is, the main stem of the river, through - without going through Oklahoma property, other than perhaps just the bank itself.       But you say entirely within Oklahoma, just because of ownership of the bank?       Or because of there's also some intervening property between Texas and the bank that Oklahoma owns?       Do -- do the current laws prohibit that -       At any point?       Well, I -- I am not quite sure I agree with your reading of the Court of Appeals' opinion.     It seems to me the Court of Appeals' opinion is consistent with the Respondents' argument that they looked at the terms of the Compact. And it seems to me that you may be right that the Compact either says you get the water or you don't, and the dormant Commerce Clause is just irrelevant.     But I read the opinion of the court of appeals as being quite consistent with that proposition. You win or you lose, up or down, under the Compact.     The dormant Commerce Clause doesn't -- just doesn't have much to do with it.       But that's the way I read the analytic approach of the court of appeals at A, when it starts talking about the point of -- Section 5.05.
11-8976 +++$+++        But what the Chief Justice indicates, it seems to me, is that if we accept your view, then there is going to be a different statute of limitations for each member of the conspiracy.     And so you have four or five different statute of limitations. I find that -- I find that puzzling.
11-9307 +++$+++        Well, it would be narrow in the sense that substantial rights would have to be affected and the other conditions of Olano met. But I think, consequent on Justice Scalia's question is, that itself would be another issue in every case.     Is this one of those cases:     Number one, it was wrong; number two, it's new; number three, is it clear under all the Olano criteria.     And that would have to be decided in every case.       So at the end of the day, it could be a small subset of cases, but the number that would be presented, both to this Court and the court of appeals, would be quite substantial.       I suppose one answer to Justice Scalia's question is that, well, if you require an objection, and you have to have a laundry list of everything that might change, but the answer to that, in turn, is, if -- if you use that rationale, then we're just asking the attorney to conceal from the judge every -- everything that's important.       It would seem to me the laundry list, even though that's perhaps an initial objection to Justice Scalia's concern, is, frankly, preferable to a system where we just don't -- don't talk about what might be clear error.       And let me ask you, I don't wish to sidetrack the discussion on the metaphysics of the Plain-Error Rule, because it's important and it's the -- part of the case, but in this case, there wasn't going to be a new trial.     There wasn't going to be a new jury.     It's just the sentence. Has any argument been made that we should have a different rule for sentences than for errors that would require a new -- a complete new trial?
11-9335 +++$+++        But the question was what -- what strategic decision do you think the lawyer should make?       So you -- but -- but Justice Alito has a real problem.     What -- don't you put the defense in a very difficult position?       But -- but isn't it difficult for you to say he had nothing to do with the drugs, plus the drugs didn't weigh more than a certain amount?       I think that I am hearing that, in every case, you are going to want witnesses -- you are going to insist on a jury determination of the amount.     That's kind of what I'm hearing.       Justice Alito says why doesn't that put defense counsel in a very difficult position?       Well, we're not getting far with this.     But one answer you could say is that, in order to preserve the constitutional right, you want us to have a bifurcated trial.     I thought you were -- might say that.       That's good because that's an extra problem. (Laughter.)
11-94 +++$+++        What have we said is the standard for fines?       What have we said with reference to a jury trial when fines are involved?     Does it have to be a substantial fine or do we have a word that we use?       But this was in the context where the entire defense of the corporation was consistent with what the indictment said.     It was between the dates on or about, and there -- it would be very strange under this evidence to think that it was only there for 1 day, when it was spilled and they came back.     And so, that just doesn't make any sense.       I think there's -- that's just more a sense of background.     I do think we have to reach the issue you -- you present as if it were just -- as if there were no evidence.       But I -- like Justice Ginsburg, I was very surprised the government didn't allege -- didn't stress waiver here.     You didn't submit an instruction?       If you were to prevail, I -- I think it would be a rather simple matter for the parties to frame an instruction:     We find the defendant guilty and that the pollutant was retained for X days, much of what they do in a drug case.     That's one way to do it.     Could the government do it by the indictment? Could it indict alternatively, indict on count 1 for 10 days, count 2 for 50 days, or something like that?       Maybe -- is that the way it often works or --       Well, that's why I am surprised the government waived it, and I thought that's what the evidence showed anyway.     But that's not before us.     That's not the way the case is presented here.
11-9540 +++$+++        Suppose the Court were to say, we now hold that the modified categorical approach applies to this statute and to these facts.     Would the plea colloquy suffice to show that under the modified categorical approach the defendant necessarily was convicted of a crime that's equivalent to the generic crime of burglary?       But if he necessarily --       -- the defendant necessarily was convicted of an offense that had the elements of a generic crime, if he necessarily was convicted of that, would that suffice?     And if it would, does the -- plea colloquy suffice to show that?       It is a two-part question. I hope I can get an answer to each.       But if under the modified categorical approach we -- we insist that in the particular case before us the generic components of the crime must necessarily have been found by the jury, and if we say that that's the rule, that's inconsistent with your view of what the law ought to be?       But under the modified categorical approach the whole point is that we do look to the plea colloquy.       Of course, which is why you say you don't think the modified categorical approach should apply.     But I'm saying suppose we say that it does and we look at the plea colloquy.     What do you want us to conclude from that?
11-965 +++$+++        Well, how -- how would you answer Justice Ginsburg's question if you were writing the opinion in your favor?     Would you say that, in the hypothetical, Daimler Chrysler put in motion a course of events that caused an injury in California?     Is that the way our jurisprudence works?       If you're going to answer the hypothetical in an opinion, how would you -- what would you say?       Well, Daimler has purposely availed itself of California jurisdiction by establishing the sub that -- that operates there by establishing Mercedes U.S., that it operates there.       So -- so creating a subsidiary is not availing itself of jurisdiction?       I agree.     And I'm asking what is the rationale that you would use to answer Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical in the -- in the opinion for the Court that is ruling in your favor?       And my question is whether or not by creating Mercedes U.S., Daimler didn't purposely avail itself of the forum?       Because?       Just as a way of getting you to state your general theory of the case, let me ask you, do you have a recommendation as to whether or not we should remand this case?     If we accept your theory of the case, which I'll let you explain, does that require a remand?       And that is because?       Under tradition, if you have the universe of agent and principal, an independent contractor, is the subsidiary of the latter or is it something -- is it some third -- some third animal?       Generally, if you have a -- a corporate parent and a subsidiary, do we usually think of a subsidiary as an agent?       Do we think of it as - what do we think about it as?     An independent contractor?     Or just something else?
11-982 +++$+++        If -- if I were to write an -- an opinion indicating that there's a chill here because distributors and retailers will see that there's been this suit against the -- your client and they will be reluctant to distribute, would there -- would I just make that up?     Or is there something I can read to find out -- to find that out, or --       Well, the -- the evidence here was that they did need investors, and investors were reluctant.       It wasn't specific evidence, but then I -- anything besides that?       Okay.     Is that -- is that in the record?       When you said it's incredibly costly to do this and so forth, is that in the record?       I mean, it makes sense, but I -- I'm a little reluctant to take judicial notice of the shoe business.     I mean --       And I would think that you would add this as well, that, for a competitor to demand that the other competitor tell its plans, its marketing, is, to say the least, patronizing, and -- and probably quite injurious, in and of itself.       But, again, there's -- do I just know that because I'm a judge?     Or is there someplace I can look for that?       Could we say there is just a presumption, that, if you're in the business, that you probably are interested in future design, period?       Wouldn't establish a --       But its future -- its future shoes are clearly -- and I thought the counsel for the Petitioner might have -- might have added this in his answer to Justice Sotomayor, that its future shoes are not covered by this.     And the -- if -- if Nike has the heavy burden of proof, can it have discovery and take depositions on what their plans are, what their marketing plans are, what designs they're thinking about?       So then -- so then the covenant not to sue gives Nike an advantage that no other manufacturer has.       Do you mean any manufacturer without -- without any litigation can ask Already, well, tell us your plans, what shoes are you thinking about?       But why should Already have to do that to anybody?       So Nike has an advantage over Already that no other manufacturers had.     It can demand what its future plans are.       Let me just ask one question on that, and it's a little bit off of what we've been talking about.     You say, in your brief, well, now, don't worry, what you can do is you can go to the trademark -- the PTO board, and they'll -- they'll adjudicate this mark.     And so -- you know, you can really go out of the courts and go to the administrators. Suppose Already goes to the administrative agency and loses.     Can it have judicial review?     And is there -- is standing easier to show, once there has been an adverse action in the administrative office?     Or are we right back where we started?     So once you go to the agency and you try to appeal, the Court says, well, this is an Article III court, we need a case of controversy, and you're right back where we are now?       That was a big part of your argument.     You were telling us, oh, don't worry, you can always go to the patent level.       No.     My -- my question is Is the Article III requirement that Already has the same in this case as it would be if they sought judicial review from an adverse order of the administrative agency?       I'm talking about going to court.
11-9953 +++$+++        Can you -- can you tell me why that is not what occurred here?       What about -- what about the basic problem in this case, as I understand the question presented, is should the State be responsible when the funding problem is at a local level? So suppose you have a State that says -- you know, we have had problems in funding; if we give this to the counties, it's going to be much better, and the counties are very, very good at raising money and knowing who the counsel are.     And so it's all handled by the county. Then one county has a disaster, a hurricane in that county, particularly.     Is that not a reason for delaying?     Or does the State have to immediately step in and -- and supplement the funding?     Can't the county say, oh, we need another two years?       I take it that's the issue that we're trying to decide here.
12-10 +++$+++        One -- one thing before your time is up.     I have the same concerns that Justice Ginsburg expressed about the difficulty of simply creating structures in -- in foreign countries.     If -- and I've looked through all of your cases. What's your closest case -- your best case for the fact that you should get extra deference because this is the foreign affairs field?     I mean, I think of U.S. v. Curtis Wright.     Anything more specific than that?
12-1036 +++$+++       And you're asking for $10,000 for each one?      You're asking for $10,000 for each one.      Are there parens patriae actions where the State Attorney General brings the action in what is really a suit on behalf of private parties?    And if so, do you call it private parens patriae?      In other words, parens patriae has to have -- you have to ask for restitution?      Well, that means that it could happen?      Well, as a matter of efficiency, take the Chief Justice's hypo, the hypothetical and back it up.    The moment the class is certified, why can't the attorney general join it and say, now, our interest is a little different, but it's so much the same that we want to join it, and we want to join it as parens patriae.    Would that prevent its removal?
12-1038 +++$+++    And that's confirmed in the terms of the easement, if you look at the easement between the U.S. and the County of Santa Barbara.   The -- it makes it very clear that the military commander has authority to exercise control over the easement property.   I suppose, if the commander thought it was necessary, he could stop trucks with flammable materials from coming through at the time when a launch is being prepared and so forth?
12-10882 +++$+++    If you talk about the condition of mental disability that's involved here, I want to go back to something you've said in response to Justice Scalia. The question was along the line of what does it mean to have a disorder under the DSM. Obviously, one thing it means is that the scholars can talk about it; that they can all focus on the same subject. Does it have any meaning other than that, that it -- it is an objective index, an objective characterization that certain people have a certain mental condition? Is -- is that what it means?   Is -- is there -- is there any evidence that society in general gives substantial deference to the psychiatric profession in this respect? Are there any studies on that or is there anything we can look to to see that that's true on not true?   We have later in the week an argument about economic theories. And it's a little different because in that case, the Court -- it's the Court's own jurisprudence and we have not said, as we have in Atkins, that it's up to the State. But do you think we defer to psychiatric -- psychologists and psychiatrists any more than we -- or any less than we do to economists?
12-1117 +++$+++    Assuming -- assuming that at some point in this case, either now or on remand, it's appropriate and necessary for us to state -- set forth what the rule ought to be, what effect, if any, do you give to the fact that there was a passenger in the car, a passenger who apparently was not involved in any illegal activity?   But it makes the police reaction more dangerous.   Did Allen bring a suit?   And was that settled out of court or something?   Oh, it remains.   Yes. I understand that. Although we're going beyond the necessities of the case, is the rule that the passenger can have a "shock of the conscience" test and it's not limited to the Fourth Amendment, even if the driver is? Is that the way it works?   Is your point that if Johnson -- is your point that if Johnson remains on the book, there's no jurisdiction?
12-1128 +++$+++       Does it help your answer or -- or does it limit the theory of your case too much to say that in this case, there is a controversy satisfying the declaratory judgment rules because the patentholder gave notice of potential -- or of infringement?    Am I right about that?      Now, could we -- or should we make the case turn on that or can we say, with declaratory judgment, there has to be a dispute, we -- we know that a dispute is likely, a controversy, so the formality of a notice is not important.      Well, it goes to me to - a basic question of fairness.    When I picked up this case, I thought, how is the patentholder supposed to know what all these new inventions are?    What does it know about it?    But then I answered my own question by saying, well, it gave notice of infringement.    But - that's why I've asked if the notice is essential to your position?
12-1146 +++$+++    And -- and my guestion is along that exact same line. Let's assume, and it's the case, that we're bound by both the result and the reasoning of Massachusetts and EPA, and the -- the American Electric v. Connecticut case. Under your view, what regulatory force, what regulatory significance, do those cases have under, A, your approach and, B, the approach by the Chamber of Commerce in the blue brief? I -- I think that may be consistent with the subject the Chief Justice just opened.   But your -- your answer is that they can be treated differently under different parts of the Act. Doesn't that contradict your earlier view that we can't change the statute?
12-1163 +++$+++  
12-1168 +++$+++    But suppose -- and this is still Justice Kagan's guestion -- suppose it were a given, assume that those laws just did not work. Could there then be consideration of a buffer zone? Now, this is a hypothetical that I'm sure that you wouldn't accept in the context of your case, but suppose.   The laws simply do not -- reference to obstruction and blocking entrance, simply do not work.   Well, am I correct that the Attorney General's regulation with respect to employees of the clinic in a way made this even more content-based because there was a prohibition on discussing the -- the abortion procedure?
12-1173 +++$+++    There were -- there were points along the right-of-way where the railroad needed a station or a wider area for water towers and so forth. And it -- it usually could receive those by simply filing a patent if it was within a permitted zone, if it was within -- if they were 20 miles equidistant or something like that. How did they get those additional lands?   One way they could do them was to condemn them, but absent condemnation, could they just receive them from the government?   Oh. So it's -- so it was clear at the time of the grant that it was on the -- that what was granted was co-extensive with what the right-of-way was, with the railroad right-of-way.   Are there any instances in which the railroad can keep its station even if it abandons the right-of-way? Or does the station fall with the -- when the right-of-way is abandoned?   And what do you want us to read there?   Well, in your answer it seemed to me, and maybe you have to do this to proffer, that you confused limited fee with fee simple ,with absolute fee. Now, obviously that's true if it's the same owner, they merge.   Is there any doctrine in property law that if a right of access is granted and its to the exclusion of all other uses, it's -- it looks for all purposes like absolute control, that it ceases to be an easement and becomes a limited fee? I mean, is there some magic that takes place in property law so that if there's a grant that conveys such total control, that it construed not to be an easement?   I've never seen it.
12-1182 +++$+++    Is part your -- your answer to Justice Kagan's guestion and Justice Scalia's guestion that it depends on the time point, at the time at which you measure? That is to say, if you take a look at a State which, for 5 years, has been trying to ameliorate pollution, you can measure it from the point 5 years ago; and if you do that, then they're not having to contribute more.   Or don't you like that answer?   How far back -- how far back do you go for the relevant NAAQ? 2006 or --   Just one more guestion on cost. In -- in your answer to Justice Kagan's guestion, there is at least a possible argument that you, the regulator, the government, the EPA, can take cost into account, unless it's expressly prohibited from doing so. You don't go that far. But you -- you even stop short of that. You say that it might be difficult to apply the cost rationale at the implementation stage? I -- I think that's what you said, and if so, I didn't quite understand.   I understand.
12-1184 +++$+++    You were talking about economic coercion. Suppose it were reversed. Suppose that Octane had the patent and sued ICON. Would the analysis be precisely the same?   I've been listening to your adjectives -- this is a search for adjectives, in part. I think you used the word meritless. What -- is there a difference between merit -- meritlessness and objectively baseless?   Because if we remand to the district court, the district court's already said it's not objectively baseless, it's not brought in bad faith. I'm not quite sure what words we're going to give to the district court if you're to prevail.   So would you say without substantial merit? I mean, if we're playing around with words again.   It's a different statute. Could we borrow from -- you mentioned EAJA. I take it that's substantially justified?   It's a different statute, It was passed later, all of -- all those problems.   Take  take your time, take your time. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RUDOLPH A. TELSCHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
12-1200 +++$+++    Will it be conceded, so far as you know, by your friends on the other side that this was appellate?   What is it that makes it appellate?
12-123 +++$+++        But you -- you began by saying that these are merits defenses, but you wanted to focus first on -- on the jurisdictional question that's before us.       Well, to get you back to the -- the jurisdiction point, let's -- let's just assume a hypothetical case where a regulated entity has to pay an exaction which it deems to be a penalty.     And let's assume it can go to the Court of Claims, but it doesn't. It waits until the penalty's assessed and then when the penalty's assessed it says, this is a taking.     That -- is that the case that you want to discuss with us today?
12-126 +++$+++        It's a small point and doesn't go to the general issues you have to discuss with us, but just, on the small point, he gets -- I forget exactly the detail -- he gets an affidavit that Jones did it within a year.     He has one.       Now, if I were the prisoner, I'd say -- you know, this one might not work. Maybe I can get two, and then he gets a second, which makes a certain amount of sense to me -- although a substantial period of time elapses -- and the same thing happens with the third. It makes sense to me that the prisoner might try to wait for the third.     How -- how does that factor into your diligence, assuming we get there?       I'm not quite -- excuse me -- I'm not quite sure that wouldn't mean that you have a whole raft of -- of petition-protective decisions waiting on the shelf in the district court.     That -- that -- that causes its own congestion problems in the district court, it seems to me.       Your -- your three-way classification, you began with Herrera?       And -- and, in a way, you're saying that you're three loops back in the Herrera a bit because, here, the innocence is the factual predicate.       But are -- are you saying that this case is a fortiori from a successive petition? Because this isn't a successive petition.       Well, you're saying that Congress knows how to write --       -- an exception if -- if they want it.     But this (b) does apply to successive petitions and this is really before that.
12-1281 +++$+++    Well, of course, Justice Ginsburg's question points out that your argument is, it seems to me, in search of a limiting principle. A lunch break, a one-day break -- you've -- you've thought about this -- a 3-day break, a 1-week break, a 1-month break; how do you resolve that problem for us?   And what about the pro forma sessions, then? They don't -- or correct me if I'm wrong. They don't require the consent of the other house.   So -- so you think there's no recess during pro forma sessions?   But it seems -- it seems to me that we're searching here for a proper interpretation of the word "session," which, after all, is in the provision that we are looking at. It talks about "next session." And we have a long tradition of Congress defining what that session is. They have the first -- this is, what, the 113th Congress? I think something like that. And they have the first and second session. That's how their records are based. This is a considered judgment by both houses of the Legislative Branch as to what "session" means, and it seems to me that that has very powerful bearing on the question of inter- and intra-session appointments that we are arguing, forget the -- when the vacancy happens to arise. And so why don't -- why don't we defer to Congress as to what the term "session" means and say that this gives us guidance as to when the -- there is a recess. There is a recess between those sessions.   But you are relying on adjournment. That -- that -- that does not have the word "recess" in --
12-1315 +++$+++    Well, then -- then -- you said both are subject to equitable consideration. We're told by the Petitioner that the equitable rule of laches simply can't apply. I was going to ask: Estoppel applies; why isn't laches just a first cousin of estoppel? Estoppel is an affirmative misrepresentation. Why isn't laches here almost a misrepresentation? And I don't understand the difference between laches and estoppel in this respect. Estoppel was an equitable remedy that's been taken into the law.   But suppose sitting on your rights amounted really to an affirmative representation. It seems to me very close, close enough so that I'm not sure that we should distinguish between laches and estoppel as being, so that the -- so that the former is unavailable at all.
12-133 +++$+++        One of the ways I have been thinking about this case is to think about arbitration and the whole point of arbitration is to have a procedure where you don't have costs, you have as an arbitrator an antitrust expert or the best in the class in the third year antitrust course in law school. And they cite reports, and -- you know, it's classic to have contractors sit in as arbitrators in construction claims; just because it's cheaper and they know -- so I was thinking that that's substantial justification for your position.     But your argument so far seems to say that doesn't make any difference.     Even if they can't bring the suit in an economic way -- the arbitration in an economic way, that that's irrelevant. That's -- that's what I'm getting from your argument.       Well, do we have a factual record?     Suppose, I think, based in substantial part on Justice Breyer's suggestion, that we could have an arbitration that's effective and we could have a trade association prepare a report, and we could do one arbitration and then see if it applies to others. Suppose I think that. Do I -- doesn't that bear on this question? And if it does, I don't have a factual record to support my assumptions.
12-135 +++$+++        So your rule is that although we must defer to an arbitrator's interpretation of the contract, in this case, there is an exception because?       So -- so we make that rule just with reference to the word "arbitration" when it's in the class action context, or does this apply to other words as well?       I'm -- I'm just not sure what the --       What is your significant point? (Laughter.)
12-1371 +++$+++    You take the position that the person with the camera says, "Back up two steps," so that the other person falls over the cliff, that's physical force?   It's strictly background information, but if you have a case of domestic violence of the aggravated sort, and there's a plea -- an offer to plead guilty in the State court, as you understand it, does the State court have the obligation to say that if you plead guilty to this crime, you cannot buy a weapon? Does the State court have the obligation to give that advice?
12-138 +++$+++    Well, then, let me just make clear where we are. Suppose we -- or at least I, were to conclude that the court of appeals was right, that it is for the Judicial Branch to decide whether there is an arbitration agreement and duty to arbitrate. Then I were to further conclude that, given Argentina's position, they have waived the judicial reguirement and that this arbitration should proceed. I can't reach that second guestion because it wasn't raised.   Well, let me just put it -- I think there is -- this is a close case. I think there is substantial merit, the United Kingdom court is correct and that the court of appeals here is correct, as to the authority of the Court to decide the issue. I also think that they are probably wrong on the merits, but I cannot reach that second guestion. It wasn't presented.   Do I understand your position that, in this case, you did not have to go to the Federal -- to the Argentine court, by reason of the language in this agreement and not by reason of anything that Argentina did?
12-1408 +++$+++    Either then or now, were the supplemental unemployment benefit payments subject to FICA withholding or are they now exempt under the present --   And after (o) was passed?   It's obviously subject to Federal income tax withholding. What about FICA?   Okay. And is that still true now?   Is it ever to the long-term advantage to the employee to have FICA withholding, so that the employee's account is greater and the benefits are greater?
12-142 +++$+++        How would you define the duty that New Hampshire imposed here according to the First Circuit and according to the Respondent?
12-144 +++$+++        Well, the Chief -- the Chief Justice and Justice Kagan have given a proper hypothetical to test your theory.     But in this case the proponents, number one, must give their official address, they must pay money, and they must all act in unison under California law.     So these five proponents were required at all times to act in unison, so that distinguishes -- and to register and to pay money for the -- so in that sense it's different from simply saying any citizen.       Do you believe this can be treated as a gender-based classification?       It's a difficult question that I've been trying to wrestle with it.       Well, then are -- are you conceding the point that there is no harm or denigration to traditional opposite-sex marriage couples?     So you're conceding that.       Well, but, then it -- then it seems to me that you should have to address Justice Kagan's question.       I -- I think there's - there's substantial -- that there's substance to the point that sociological information is new.     We have five years of information to weigh against 2,000 years of history or more. On the other hand, there is an immediate legal injury or legal -- what could be a legal injury, and that's the voice of these children.     There are some ,000 children in California, according to the Red Brief, that live with same-sex parents, and they want their parents to have full recognition and full status. The voice of those children is important in this case, don't you think?       And you might address why you think we should take and decide this case.
12-1493 +++$+++    Your position is that this is not a material misstatement; is that correct?   Why isn't it material in light of the fact that it was a question that was on the government form that was promulgated, that was directed by regulations?   In describing what happened here, you -- you -- you said that Abramski went in and then went to Pennsylvania and gave the gun to his uncle. That's not quite correct. He -- he transferred it to him for consideration. I had thought, and this was -- goes back to Justice Scalia's question -- question about if there's one buyer here or two. I had thought that it might be possible that you can -- to construct a case where Abramski tells his uncle, I'm going to buy the gun, and then I'm going to sell it to you, and I'm going to sell it to you in Pennsylvania at a gun dealer's store so we can fill out the necessary forms. Would the government then have objected to what happened here?   I mean, we can ask the government --    as Justice Scalia indicates, but under -- as you understand their case.
12-158 +++$+++       If you had been the President's counsel, would you have advised him that it was unconstitutional to sign this treaty as written?      Is it -- is it one way to characterize your argument or is it too unfairly confining to your argument to say that what you're suggesting is something like a clear statement rule, that if the treaty intends nation states to have their own constitutional structure superseded at a minimum it has to say so, and then we will come to the question of whether or not they can do it?
12-167 +++$+++        Well, suppose you just stick with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, or perhaps not even a hypothetical, what happened in this case. Just assume that the defense attorney likes this judicial intervention and he -- he wants this to take place.     It -- it seems quite unfair to talk about the plain error because he doesn't tell -- as Justice Ginsburg says, what does the defendant know about Rule (c)?     He doesn't know about it.       That's -- what happens under -- under the rule if the magistrate asked that the defendant be excused -- I don't know quite how you do that, the defendant has to be present.     But can the - can the judge just have the attorneys before him and say, now, I want you to be very, very clear that this is a mandatory minimum, that we should try to avoid if at all possible. Can he do that?       It's awfully hard to have a hypothetical where you exclude the defendant.
12-17 +++$+++       What's your closest case in support of the proposition that this is impermissible as a discrimination against interstate commerce?     What's your best case?      If -- if you -- you are arguing, as one of your arguments here, that this is discriminatory as to -- as to interstate commerce, as I understand your argument, what is the best case you have to support your position?    What's the closest case?      Well, my question is what's the best case you have for your argument?       But that wasn't a discrimination.    That wasn't a -      That's just -- that goes to the question whether or not this is commerce.      What -- what is your best case to show that this is discriminatory in violation of our precedence?      Now -- if I have to write the opinion, what case do I put down?    I'm waiting.      That's why you're here. (Laughter.)
12-207 +++$+++        Is it -- is it your position that this is a search incident to an arrest?       Why isn't this is a search incident to an arrest?       Just -- just like taking the pockets out and -- and seeing what's in the person's overcoat and so forth.     It is a search incident to an arrest.
12-236 +++$+++        But is -- is the upshot of your argument then that filing means different things under different provisions of the Act?       And if that's so, it tends to weaken the force of your reliance on -- on filing in the statute -- on the word "filing" in the statute of limitations section.       Well, I meant -- I meant Page 9 that just to supplement Justice Kagan's question.     I didn't mean to cut it off.       The shadow trial brings up the answer that you were giving to the second part of Justice Alito's question, which you never got to finish.       And you were saying -- you were giving the example, suppose this were a question of timeliness.       And when did the fact of the vaccine first -- or the symptoms first become manifest, and you were -- and you said that this should not be tried because -- and this is finishing off Justice --       -- Justice Alito's dichotomy.
12-246 +++$+++        Well, but it's -- it's well settled that, when you're -- wherein you're examining the witness and he takes -- and he suddenly says, I don't want any more questions, that that's -- he's waived if you're in court, if you're examining a witness on the stand. So, against that background, suppose, in this case, the facts were just about the same, and he said what -- the police said, what would you do if we matched the shotgun shells?     And he said -- he said, "Well" -- and then he starts to cry.     He said one word, "Well," and he started to cry.     Admissible?       Because he said, "Well"?       But -- but could the police officer also testify that and then he started to cry?       Or the prosecution could say, Well, he said, well, and started to cry, and he never told us anything else.     That -- that final sentence that I used is impermissible?       Is -- I don't want -- are you saying that, before the Miranda warning is required, you cannot invoke the Fifth Amendment?       I mean -- that's my - that's how I understood that.       I know you're not arguing that, but that's why I'm -       Well, but it can be invoked, and that might make a big difference.     In your -- in your brief, you acknowledge that most citizens know they have a Fifth Amendment right.       And so if there's -- if questions are somehow troublesome, you say, I'm invoking my Fifth Amendment right; go away, even if you're not in custody, even if Miranda doesn't apply.       And your client didn't do that here.       You're -- you're giving us Miranda, not Miranda, custody, not custody, gray area. That -- that's what you're arguing.     You want a gray area opinion to be written?
12-25 +++$+++        Well, aren't we going to be told the whole essence of the class action is you have to see if there is an injury that goes beyond some particular clients that you know.     And isn't this -- isn't this investigation in anticipation?       Well, the anticipation is, are -- are you willing to join the class?       Isn't that critical?       Well, I do think you are helped somewhat by the -- the chronological progression here, is it including the service of process, which means the case has already started, and then investigation in anticipation of the litigation that follows the service of process. So it -- it is true that there is a chronological aspect.     In order, it seems to me, for the Respondents to prevail, they have to say that investigation in anticipation of litigation also precedes service of process.       Well, are -- are you saying that the study must be either a solicitation or an investigation?     It can't be both?     Why can't it be both?       Well, I -- I understand your argument about (12), but I -- I do think that you ought to assume we might interpret this statute, so that each of these is independent, and you have to concentrate on (4).     You keep going back to (12), when we're talking about (4). If you talk about (4) for a minute, it seems to me that you might give away too much because the statute says, "including service of process," which means the suit has to begin and then investigation in anticipation of the litigation that will follow after that suit has come in. But you seem to give that away.     You seem to think that investigation in anticipation of litigation can be before the suit is filed.     You -- you seem to concede that.       I don't know why you concede that.
12-3 +++$+++       Is one of the limitations in the statute where it says, in sub (1), "to provide information relating to fraud against shareholders"?    Do you think "shareholders" means just the shareholders of the public company or does it mean shareholders of the -- suppose you have an accountant which has shareholders in it.    And there is a fraud with the accounting firm and it hurts the shareholders of the accounting firm, but not the company that's registered.    Does the -      The shareholders -- in other words, does "shareholder" apply just to the publicly registered company?      You would think so.      So "fraud against shareholders" just modifies the last clause or any provision of Federal law?      Well, you say -- you say this is -- this is a mainstream application.    We still have to give a rule.    Do we write in the opinion, this is a mainstream application case and therefore it is so confined?    That -- that doesn't make any sense.      Well, that -- that was your second point.    Your first point was just talk about the mainstream in this case and leave other cases.    But I don't see how you can do that and interpret the statute.    That's what I'm asking.    Your statutory interpretation rule to keep this the mainstream is what?      I understand that and I -- I think that's a plausible reading.    I don't see how it's confined to so-called mainstream, which is what we were talking about.
12-307 +++$+++        In Federal court's jurisprudence, are you saying there's a lack of adversity here?       Can you give us a pigeonhole?       But it seems to me there -- there's injury here.       But then why does he enforce the statute?       But let me ask you, suppose that constitutional scholars have grave doubts about the practice of the President signing a bill, but saying that he thinks it's, unconstitutional -- what do you call it, signing statements or something like that. It seems to me that if we adopt your position that that would ratify and confirm and encourage that questionable practice because if the President thinks the law is unconstitutional he shouldn't sign it, according to some views.     And that's a lot like what you're arguing here. It's very troubling.       You think Congress can use its powers to supercede the traditional authority and prerogative of the States to regulate marriage in all respects?     Congress could have a uniform definition of marriage that includes age, consanguinity, et cetera, et cetera?       Well, but then there is a federalism interest at stake here.     And I thought you told the Chief Justice there was not.       But you're -- you are insisting that we get to a very fundamental question about equal protection, but we don't do that unless we assume that the law is valid otherwise to begin with.    And we are asking is it valid otherwise.    Is -- what is the Federal interest in enacting this statute and is it a valid Federal interest assuming -- before we get to the equal protection analysis?
12-315 +++$+++    You had -- you're saying -- you're saying there were three critical facts. One is that these reports have to be made on suspicions right away in realtime, by people like baggage handlers. And your second point was?   And then the third? And your third?   In this context, it's not clear to me what the issue is that's before us. My understanding is, is that there was no finding of falsity. Now, the jury was instructed that it had to be defamatory. Lawyers know that that means it has to be false, I assume. And are you saying that -- you know, the jurors weren't instructed as to the definition of "defamatory"? Is that the point?   By the court.   What  what position -- although they'll tell us in a minute -- does Respondent take on that issue that a determination by the jury suffices? As you understand their brief. They can talk for themselves in a few minutes.   But isn't that implicit in the instruction to the jury, that it has to be defamatory? Now, if you say, well, even if it is, the judge -- the court has a duty to determine, as a matter of law, at the outset, then that's something else.   Mr. Feigin, do you think that the statute, 44941, was intended by the Congress to incorporate the New York Times-Sullivan standard, the Masson v. New Yorker standard? And -- and if so, then it -- it seems to me that the airline is under a duty more strict than the one that you have just explained and the Petitioner's counsel has explained.   So -- so you want us to write an opinion to say that the -- that the statute here is to be interpreted differently than if it were a New York Times and Sullivan case or Masson-New Yorker case?
12-357 +++$+++        If the jury had -- had returned the verdict, which is at JA142, and it had marked that the attempt to extort was to extort the commitment, you might still maybe have some causation arguments, but I assume the property argument you're about to make is just irrelevant.       Could -- could the case have been indicted -- has it been charged as one in which what they were taking was the commissions that would ultimately have been generated?       Well, here, what the Petitioner wanted were the commissions, ultimately.     And you can't commit extortion in order to get -- and that's real money.     It's for the Government to answer, not you, but can -- do you have any idea why they didn't charge that?       I see.     I see.       Well, I took you away from your argument about intangible property.       Well, just let me make sure that I understand your position.     Suppose roughly these facts, the general counsel is threatened with something very serious, let's say violence, unless he makes a favorable recommendation.     He does.     They act on that recommendation, it's -- it's a substantial cause in making the investment, and the investment is made and they get the money.     Violation?       Well, but -- but that's a causation argument, not whether or not you received property.       But so far as the property point in my hypothetical, if the recommendation leads to the contract and the contract leads to the commission and the commission means money in your pocket, that's property.       And so then we just have a causation argument, not a property argument.
12-398 +++$+++        From what you know and from what the record shows, would the process of tagging the isolated DNA be patentable?     The process of tagging, we just don't know about that or is there a patent on that?       Under our -- our law, is a patent ever divisible so that if it's valid in part but invalid in another part, it can still stand as to the part?       But if you haven't challenged this, then -- then where are we with respect to the tagging?     I don't quite understand.     Because the -- the entire patent, which includes tagging, would fail under your argument.       Well, I'm not sure the Court can decide the case on -- on that basis.     I'm sure that there are substantial arguments in the amicus brief that this investment is necessary and that -- and that makes sense.     To say, oh, well, the taxpayers will do it, don't worry, is, I think, an insufficient answer. As Justice Kagan's follow-up questions indicated, I thought you might say, well, there are process patents that they can have, that this is sufficient.       But I -- I just don't think we can decide the case on the ground, oh, don't worry about investment, it'll come.     I -- I just don't think we can do that.     It may be that the law allows you to prevail on the fact that this is -- occurs in nature and there's nothing new here, but that's quite different.       When I first looked at this case, I -- I thought that maybe the cDNA was kind of an economy class gene, was -- it wasn't.     But my understanding is that it may have a functionality that the -- the DNA isolate does not, easier to tag, et cetera.     That may be incorrect for the record, but that was my present understanding.       Is all the tagging done on recombinant DNA?
12-399 +++$+++        In -- in your view, at what point, at what date did the Indian father lose the right to ask for custody?     Because he changed his mind in -- in January, there was about a 5-day period there.       The adoption proceedings had not concluded.       And at this point he said, in effect, I've changed my mind.       So the State law determines when his rights under the Federal Act end?       Well, and even in that sense, serious emotional and physical damage is a much different threshold than the best interests of the child, even on the statutory terms.       And I -- and I take it you'll say that that goes back to this South Carolina court if you prevail?       If the best interest of the child is the uniformly accepted standard in State courts, and if we forget constitutional avoidance problems which I -- I think exist here, is there anything in the statute that allows us to import the best interests of the child into the statutory language, or do we have to just rely on constitutional avoidance and -- and really rewrite the statute?
12-414 +++$+++        When we're asking whether the advice was reasonable, what force do we give to the proposition that a well-counselled defendant was now insisting that he wanted to change his plea?     And there was only three days.     How do we factor that in?     If - if we look at the gist of what the counsel did -       -- it may lead us to one answer.     But if we know that a previously well-counselled defendant had now changed his mind and wanted to withdraw, how do we factor that in?
12-416 +++$+++        And one way is to assess the validity or the strength of the infringement case?       That's -- that's my concern, is your test is the same for a very weak patent as a very strong patent.     That doesn't make a lot of sense.       Why wouldn't that determination itself reflect the strength or weakness of the patent so that the market forces take that into account?       Is that the 18 -- the 18-month rule primarily?       Right.     I mean 180 days, yes.
12-417 +++$+++       Except you would look and say, those clothes probably have something special underneath them.    I mean, in ordinary parlance I think that would be a proper use of diction.
12-418 +++$+++        The discussion so far has assumed, your discussion primarily, that there's this line between civil and criminal, we don't need to worry about ex post facto.     Is that line made clear in our Page 15 precedents or is there some room to argue that if the line is somewhat blurred that there may be ex post facto concerns here and that that in turn is a reason for constitutional avoidance when we evaluate your argument? Is that -- is the civil -- a criminal distinction with reference to Ex Post Facto Clause absolutely foreclosed and clear in the facts of this case?
12-43 +++$+++        Suppose everyone in the case conceded that the purpose of this statute was to compensate the government for having valued the shares at too low a price, and this was stated right in the enactment.     Would that change your argument?       Well, suppose we think this is both a tax on profits and a tax on low value. Then what do we do?       Suppose it's a one -- if I could just -- suppose -- we say, well, this is a one-time tax, in order to recalculate, reassess the value.     If it's on income, it's still an Excess Profits Tax, in your view?
12-462 +++$+++    Is the choice we have here only between State law and no relief? Or is there some theory under which either Federal common law or an appeal to the DOT could give the flyer, the customer, some relief? And -- you know, we can all think of crazy hypotheticals. Suppose the phone rings, and he says, I'm John Doe, I want to talk to you about my airline, you've miscalculated. They said, Mr. Doe, we've heard from you 15 times, you're -- you're out of this program. It's a mistaken identity. There are two John Does. Can the -- can the innocent, good-faith John Doe do any -- anything at all?   Well, but  in part of that suit, wouldn't you have to -- the judge says, what's the underlying substance, and you say, well, there's a duty of good-faith dealing under Minnesota law. And then you're right back where you started, unless there's some -- unless there's some Federal common law with Lincoln Mills or something like that?   Well, I still don't understand the substantive basis for the breach of contract suit, if you say we can't refer to State law.   I still -- I still have this problem. You say don't -- now, don't worry, you can always bring an express contract action. And I say, well, what law do you apply? Well, you -- you have no State law, and there's no Federal common law. I don't understand how you can bring an action with no substantive law to inform it.   Well, it's easy for you -- for you, representing the government, but suppose you were representing the airline. Would you come up here and say, the airlines want it to be well known that we don't have to be reasonable? I -- I find that very difficult to understand.
12-464 +++$+++        In your view, what weight does the court -- the trial court in this hearing, give to the fact of the indictment?       So no weight.     We've now had a hearing, I ignore the indictment, and let's have a trial.     That's your position?       No.     I would think the government has the burden of proof.       What about -- what about a detention hearing?     Same rule?       It would be the government under a detention hearing -- pardon me.     The trial court under the detention hearing ignores the fact of the indictment?       And it was a case with very substantial documents, et cetera?
12-484 +++$+++ 
12-515 +++$+++    What's your best authority -- what's your best case for that proposition?   That  that States have a lesser burden when they're faced with a sovereign immunity defense?   What's your best case for that?   You know, that's -- that's a big reading assignment. (Laughter.)   Why couldn't you at least -- I think this is Justice Alito's question. I don't mean to interrupt. But why couldn't you say that it's a matter of compact interpretation whether these are Indian lands?   Right. So you go to Federal court to interpret the contract. There's no -- immunity has been waived, and you say these are not Indian lands. I think that's what Justice Alito was asking. I didn't mean to interrupt him.   But the compact refers to Indian lands. Surely, you could take the position that there is a waiver of immunity to determine whether or not these are Indian lands under the compact.
12-5196 +++$+++    Your position is that the trustee can take no action to make the estate whole in the event of, say, Justice Alito's type of hypothetical, the bank -- the estate bankruptcy trustee spends $125,000 in legal fees to bring property back to the estate that had been concealed by wrongful conduct of the debtor and the debtor still gets $75,000 of that? There's nothing the bankruptcy trustee can do to make that bankruptcy estate whole?   Is It? Now what about the house? The house was still exempt because if they levy on the house, you go back to bankruptcy and it's still exempt. So there's nothing you can do to make the trustee -- the estate whole.   When you say, "paid off," do you mean paid off 100 percent?   Do they get a thank-you letter from the -- (Laughter.)
12-52 +++$+++  
12-536 +++$+++        I just want to be clear what your answer to Justice Kagan was, her hypothetical. Is -- is part of your answer that this might -- the hypothetical that she gives -- contravene earmarking? Or -       So is part of your answer to her there that the hypothetical isn't real or isn't going to happen or -       -- or can't happen under the existing law?     Is that your answer?       Is this -- is this - would the other side concede that this is true?       Well, suppose -- suppose a number of PACs -- I forget the number in Justice Kagan's example -- said, we're going to give to congressional and senatorial candidates who -- who want to cut down on governmental spending, and we know there's only about four people that are like that.
12-547 +++$+++        Was the 1973 case that you mentioned based on a statute, or was it based on, allegedly, a vacuum that the statutory structure allowed the court to fill?     I mean, is that the way the 1973 case came about?     And was the 1973 case followed by other courts?     Or was it just an isolated precedent?       Are there any States with a statute identical or -- or close to the Michigan statute that have interpreted the statute to say it does include diminished capacity?       This statute is -- fairly well tracks the common law tradition, which indicates that diminished capacity is not a defense.       I'm just curious to know if any State courts have reached an opposite conclusion under a statute like this.
12-562 +++$+++        Well, isn't it your position in this case that outside basis in this case is necessarily related to inside basis?       Or am I misstating that?       But -- but if we were to write an opinion which says -- an opinion ruling in your favor, that, in this case, outside basis is necessarily related to inside basis in this transaction, you would say that's wrong?       Why -- and why is that?       Maybe it was a frame with a blank canvas.
12-574 +++$+++       But in -- in this case, it was known or should have been known that these were gamblers, they were in Nevada.    That's where a lot of - that's where their gambling takes place.    They were residents of Nevada.    So in that sense, they were like the plaintiff in -- in Calder.    The injury was there and the defendant arguably knew or should have known that that's where its major impact would be. I recognize your point that when you take money away, then you're inconvenienced in any State where you happen to be.    But there was an argument here -- it seems to me there is an argument here that this was gambling and these people were from Nevada and so you've -- this -- this curtails their right or -- or their option to conduct -- to conduct their activities in -- in Nevada.      Let me ask this -- and it's probably clear in the briefs.    Is -- is the gravamen of the complaint the seizure at the airport or the later false affidavit?    Because to the extent it's the later false affidavit, that cuts against you marginally.      Do we know how much of the information, the supplemental information, that was prepared in Nevada and then was forwarded to Georgia, how much of that information was in the affidavit?      Could this record or these complaints be read to support the conclusion that the injury was substantially altered by the false affidavit, based on the misuse of the information received from Nevada?
12-609 +++$+++        Well, but just -- I have the same concern as Justice Scalia.     I mean, that makes your case easier, but it seems to me that the defendant puts his mental capacity in issue and then testifies himself, but with no expert, the State can still call its own expert so far as the -- so far as the Federal constitution is concerned.     There might be some Kansas rules about it.       If I could just make -- it seems to me that it's not necessary to make our decision depend on whether or not another expert has been called. That makes your case easier.     And sometimes, when we write opinions, we take the easiest route. But I take it, under your theory, even if the defendant had not called his own expert, we would still have the same issue before the Court, and you would take the position that a prosecution expert can testify.     Now, whether or not he can use the previous statement, that's -- that's the second point.       But -- but why doesn't it settle the matter as a -- as you understand the case that's being presented -- as a constitutional matter? Sure.     Kansas may have some rules, maybe the judges say I'm not going to hear this, this -- this is a State rule, but insofar as the -- the Federal constitution is concerned, why doesn't that settle it?
12-62 +++$+++        Your -- your brief spent some time on statistics, how often this happens.     But I take it you're not saying that our inquiry is a statistical one.     You're simply saying that the statistics bear out that, as an objective legal matter, the framework that you are explaining to us is and must be followed?       And would it be ex post facto in -- in the hypothetical Justice Scalia gave?       Could you remind me -- it's in the briefs -- if a sentence is appealed, what is the review authority of the appellate court?     It must begin with the guidelines as the framework?
12-682 +++$+++        Well, while you're on Seattle, can you -- I have difficulty distinguishing Seattle.     One factual difference is that there was a school board there, a directly-elected school board elected for a short term of years.     Here there's a board of trustees. Is that -- is that the distinguish -- a distinguishing factor in the case in which a principal distinction could be made?       But you're saying there - there are three things.     One, the first you reject.       The law was a racial focus.       Okay.     And the second was an incremental improvement in the -- in the democratic process -- or democratic responsibility?       Responsiveness, I guess.       And was there a third, did you say?       That, it seemed to me a good distinction for Hunter and Mulkey v. Reitman, which the briefs don't talk much about.       But not necessarily a distinction in Seattle because Seattle you could argue, well, there are other methods that are less racially divisive.       What would you do with a constitutional amendment that said pro-affirmative action laws, and only those, require a three-quarters vote of the State legislature?
12-696 +++$+++       Why -- why was it that you so promptly answered Justice Kagan's question to the effect that this would be a violation?    What/why would there be a violation in the instance she put?      The first question Justice Kagan asked you, the hypothetical about the prayer in this Court.    You seemed readily to agree that that would be a First Amendment violation.    Why?      Well, is it -- is it simply history that makes -- there's no rational explanation?    It's just a historical aberration?      Well, what's -- what's the justification for the distinction?      Well, if we had a -- if we had a series of cases, what -- what is a -- a utility rate-making board would come to the Supreme Court.    We say, well, it's enough like a legislative that it's like Marsh.    But I don't think the public would understand that.      Well, the essence of the argument is we've always done it this way, which has some -- some force to it.    But it seems to me that your argument begins and ends there.      Of course, your -- your test is whether or not -- part of your test -- is whether or not it advances religion.    If you ask a chaplain for the State assembly in Sacramento, California, who's going to go to the assembly to deliver a prayer, are you going to advance your religion today, would he say oh, no?      So -- so you -- you use the word "advance" only as modified by "proselytize"?      Because that's -- that's not what your -- your brief says "does not proselytize or advance."      But that's that the test you want us to adopt and -      -- I'm asking whether or not it is, in fact, honest and candid and fair to ask the minister or -- or the priest or the chaplain or the rabbi if by appearing there, he or she seeks to advance their religion?      If not, I'm not quite sure why they're there.
12-71 +++$+++        Could you also ask for an address, for proof of the address, or proof of date of birth?       But then again, it seems to me the Federal form, as some of my colleagues have indicated, is not worth very much.       Well, I take it -- I take it that -- that counsel on -- on -- on the other side will disagree with that and they say, well, this is -- this is the line to be drawn.     The -- the postcard is presumptive evidence of registration and -- and of qualification.     And if you have evidence to the contrary, then it's different.     But otherwise, the whole utility of the single form is missing -- is gone.       Other than the statutory words that authorize the use of the form.
12-729 +++$+++        Is there any evidence in other circuits that have this same rule that -- that the approach the Respondents advocate has caused difficulties and disruption and unfairness?       But in this case, as Justice Ginsburg indicated at the outset, there was a period of, I think, just over a year, in which it was very clear that the administrative process had ended and nothing happened.     I don't see the unfairness in the application of the rule in this case.       Well, but there is also certainty and fairness in processing the claim, and when evidence is lost, especially in cases where employees who were key witnesses have likely departed, that's another very important consideration.       Those are general statutes, so they would be preempted just in this class of claims.     So lawyers would have to know that this statute is still valid for many purposes, but not for ERISA.       But then you have -- you have lack of uniformity within the State on when these claims must be brought under an insurance policy.
12-751 +++$+++    You -- you want us to say that we have sort of a coach class trustee. We're all traveling in coach class when we have an ESOP. Once -- once we go down that road, how -- how do we define what the duties of the trustee are?   Is there anything in the trust law or the common law that allows us to define benefits that way?   It's just background information for this point you're discussing. Can -- can you tell me, is it a very common practice for the directors and officers of the company themselves to be the trustees? I had just assumed that that didn't happen much anymore. Can you just tell me, because a lot of these problems would be taken care of, insider information and so forth, if there was an outside trustee. And I assume -- tell me if I'm wrong -- that the reason for the trust -- for the company themselves to do it is because it saves money. It's -- it's cheaper than hiring an outside investment. Maybe I'm wrong about that. But can you --   Can you just tell us what the -- what the landscape is?   Well, how do you fine define the standard or the duty that's responsive to Justice Alito's concern? And I had the same problem. Let's assume that trustees in a non-ESOPs plan have a duty to maximize returns and provide stable investments. Is it somehow different when it's an ESOP?   And if so, what is the duty?   How do you define it?   Well, if I'm the trustee, I don't know what my duty is based on your answer. I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
12-7515 +++$+++       Well, it said -- the statute says results, right?      And so we're asking about results.    Justice Alito's hypothetical, he gives a three-day supply.    Suppose he gives a year's supply and he overdoses the next day, what result?      No, no, no.    As a matter of law, is that a violation?      All right.    Suppose we go back to Justice Alito's example and it's just a two-day supply and there are statistics that 1 percent of heroin users overdose.    Is that sufficient to establish liability under your foreseeability standard?      Well, the question is what the legal standard is.    I'm the juror.    I said -- I want to know does this suffice to impose liability?    And you say well, if you say it is.    Does it or doesn't it? That's a -- that's a fair question.    Just -- you can't say, oh, well, it's up to the jury.    We don't know.    I want to know what the rule is.    The juries have to follow a rule.      I -- I just want to get your position as -- as a matter of law. Let's assume 1 percent of heroin users overdose.    Dealer sells to an addict he's never seen before.    Doesn't know anything about his age, background or anything.    Just sells him the drug.    The heroin addict overdoses.    Liability or not?    Can there be liability under those facts?      No, but in a civil context -- excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice. In the civil context, you have strict -- you have strict liability.    This is in a way strict liability and seems to me quite proper.      A drug company if it -- if it doesn't take proper steps, it is liable even if 1 percent of the users are adversely affected. Excuse me, Chief.
12-761 +++$+++    And so do you concede that under the Lanham Act, plaintiff could not challenge aspects of the a food label that the FDA said is reguired?   I know that's not this case.   I want you to answer the guestion, though.   Do you agree that if you brought this suit under state law, it would be preempted?   Where -- where is that statement contained?   Thank you.   Any authority that the FDA interpretation gets deference is presumed to be correct, or presumed to be not misleading? Has there ever been any scholarship or commentary or cases saying that?
12-7822 +++$+++       Suppose her friend is a forensics professor at the law school.      And she said, you know, I'm concerned there might be evidence of a crime here; I don't want any part of it, I want you to give me your expert opinion on that.      I don't know why you want us to write an opinion saying that the police are different from anybody else.    There's just no -- no authority for that.      What happens next?    What happens next for ten hours, ten days?    He was in custody for 500 plus days and for all that time, the co-tenant, the wife, cannot invite the police to look for a shotgun where the four-year-old knows that it is and she may not know how to handle the weapon?    She can't get a policeman to assist her for 500 days?    This is not Randolph.    This is a vast extension of Randolph.      But Justice Breyer's question was very carefully phrased to indicate, at least to me, that there was no probable cause.    You're asking the property owner to invoke a legal form that is itself highly invasive.    She doesn't want a warrant. She wants the police to come in for advice.      He was in jail for 500-plus days, and you're saying that for all that time, the co-occupant has no complete control over the premises.      Well, when you say the - the police prohibit him from exercising that right, there was an arraignment before a magistrate.    The judicial system ordered him -- ordered him confined.      So the cotenant has much less authority to allow people to enter if her other cotenant is -- is a criminal than if he's a law-abiding citizen?    That's the result.      That's -- that's the result of the way you allocate the rights and duties of the cotenant who allows the -- the person to enter.      No, no.    The law-abiding citizen says I'm going away for three days, don't let anybody in the house, but the cotenant can overcome that, but not in the case of the -- well, I'm interrupting your -- your rebuttal.
12-786 +++$+++    Well, should the rule be different for a method patent than a device patent?   That's because the statute isn't different, I assume.
12-79 +++$+++        Well, I -- I think there's some problem with whether or not this was covered securities, but I also think that's not in the case anymore.     Am I correct in the latter assumption?       Your white light is on, but what is the simplest formulation of your test? If -- if we were to write the opinion your way, what - the test would be?       Well, I mean, if you -- if you went to church and heard a sermon that there are lots of people that are evil, maybe then you wouldn't invest, but I'm -
12-794 +++$+++    So would it have been an acceptable and workable rule to say that, in a sentencing hearing, on any point where the defendant has the burden of proof the government is entitled to testimony, that silence can be the basis for an adverse inference?   I mean, you have to either say yes or no. If -- if you say no, then I ask why remorse is different? If you say yes, then remorse is included within that.   I don't understand why you're not entitled to the instruction on all issues as to which the defendant has the burden of proof --   -- in a sentencing hearing.   The -- the assumption in my question is that the defendant has the burden of proof on a certain number of issues in the sentencing hearing. As to all of those issues, it seems to me it has to be your position that the government is entitled to the instruction that I described. Or you're just going to stand up and say, well, remorse is different, but I -- we need to know what -- what your argument is.   Well, that's one way of asking it, yes.
12-815 +++$+++       Well, what would have been the ruling, do you think -- what would have been the correct ruling if you had filed your Federal action while the case was still -- the issue was still pending before the Iowa board?    In other words, before the State judicial review process kicked in.    Would your analysis of the case be the same or would we apply a different -      Because it would be an - because it would be Burford at that point or what?
12-820 +++$+++    Is that eguitable discretion, or is that still eguitable tolling? Because, as I understand eguitable tolling, if it applies and, say, there's a 6-month suspension, the child must go back, so that there's -- so that the -- that the weighing that you're talking about just doesn't -- doesn't come into play.   And -- and it does provide -- just while people are looking at it, it does provide that, even though there's, in your view, equitable tolling, there are still circumstances in which the child would not go back, if there's a grave -- grave risk?   Grave risk of harm to the child.   But, again, as Justice Ginsburg questions, it seems to me indicates, there are two different axes here. One is the best interest of the child, and the other is an adequate deterrent so that parents don't abduct. But those axes don't cross very often, if at all.   But that still -- but Article 13 still is different from what's in the best interest of the child.   Now, it's true that all we're talking about is for the -- during the time in which the hearing takes place, but these hearings take years, and expert witnesses are not available or readily available.   Which court? Which court? To use the --   But in a sense, what you're saying is that it's not an automatic -- it's not an automatic rule. The more you argue that Section 13 is applicable, the more you're watering down the very rigid rule that you want, in order to say that there has to be deterrence.
12-842 +++$+++    We're waiting. What about property in another country? We're waiting.   But the guestions from the Court so far have narrowed the issue to property on which there could be execution in a foreign -- if it were in a foreign nation, and you said, Well, military and consulate. No, no. We're talking about property that if here would be subject to execution. What's wrong with asking the judgment debtor in this Court, in this case, whether or not there are such assets, without reference to military and government officials, et cetera, property that's used in commercial transactions on which there can be execution in the United States?   No, discovery is about assets that can be executed on, but they are in other countries. And you started saying, Oh, but the military and so forth. That's not -- that's not this case.   Well, it's this case on the or- -- but it's not -- it's not what the Court has been suggesting.   Just one question. I thought that I would hear a lot about waiver in this case. Does the waiver in the bonds not affect this case or its outcome?
12-8561 +++$+++    Would you agree  would you agree that the --    the losses here were the proximate result at least of the aggregate actions of all the offenders? Would you go that far?   Would  would you agree that it is the proximate result of the aggregate actions of all the offenders?   Pardon me. A proximate harm, right?   My question is -- my question is why isn't it -- and you were going to point to the statute -- why isn't it at least the result of the aggregate number -- aggregate offenders?   But he is -- he is one of the offenders in the aggregate.   Well, you're right back to the question Justice Kagan began, that if you have two offenders, that there's going to be recovery. If you have 1,002, there won't be.
12-872 +++$+++        If we adopt that formulation and that solution, is it as if we are granting certiorari before judgment on an issue in our own discretion?     Is that the way it works?       Well, but how -- what's the mechanism for us -- what's the rationale that we can exercise jurisdiction where a court of appeals could not?     Because we have -       -- authority to grant certiorari before judgment or for some other reason?
12-873 +++$+++ 
12-895 +++$+++       Do you agree that the jury could find the defendant guilty of the firearms charge under a proper instruction?    In other words, was there sufficient evidence so that if a proper instruction were given, there could have been a conviction?      Well, I guess we can get into later to whether or not if you know a firearm is being carried and if you then facilitate the commission of the underlying felony by driving the car, participating in the transaction, whether that's sufficient. But let me ask you this:    Would the instruction that was given, which was at JA 196, would it be okay if Paragraph 1, "The defendant knew his cohort used a firearm," I think there is a real problem with that, because it's retrospective. Would the instruction have been sufficient if the defendant knew his cohort would use or was carrying?    Would that change it?      Justice Scalia can -- his own question.    But the question is:    What -- what does the jury have to find?    I know they can -- I know what they can infer, but the question from Justice Scalia is, you're the -- you drive -- you drive the car, you know firearms are there and might be used, is that sufficient?    And that's his question.      Well, that's -- that's a conclusion.    The jury, it seems to me, could say you do facilitate it if in these hypotheticals you drive the car -      -- with knowledge that the gun might be used.      Well, the submission is the jury can find otherwise.      The -- the gun would never have been used if you didn't drive the -- or carried if you didn't drive the car.      I just didn't -- you said the only evidence was that it was inside the gun?      And what was the evidence? I thought there was evidence that he possessed cartridges.      And was there any evidence that he had the gun?      I mean, was the evidence that he had the gun and the evidence of the cartridges are exactly the same?      But do we have cases that say that assisting flight immediately after the crime is not aiding and abetting the crime?    The crime is over? So everybody says the crime's over.    Let's -- let's walk home.      No.    I think it would help if you told us what the definition of the crime is. We'll talk about the jury instructions later. Justice Scalia is asking whether or not if you facilitate the drug crime knowing that a weapon is being carried, if that is sufficient for aiding and abetting as a legal matter?    Forget the jury instructions.      I just want to make clear, and we'll get back to the bank robbery hypothetical. Driving the car, knowing a gun is being carried and might be used, is or is not sufficient facilitation to make you an aider and abetter in the drug -- in the gun aspect of the crime?      But you are not carrying. Your -- your cohort is carrying the gun.      You are driving the car, the cohort has the gun, the cohort is going to rob the bank.    Are you or are you not aiding and abetting because you're facilitating it by driving the car, yes or no?
12-9012 +++$+++    Well, let me just make it clear. If -- if the loan is for $300,000, fraudulent loan -- fraudulently obtained loan, and the property is foreclosed upon, and it's worth at the time $200,000, is it your position that the property's been fully returned and that there is no liability for the difference?   Okay.   Okay.   But you say the sentencing judge has to call appraisers? I mean, valuation of property is the standard stuff of -- of civil proceedings in -- in condemnation and many other cases. You call -- each side calls appraisers. The appraisers give their -- their judgment and then either the jury or the judge decide. You want that to happen in every -- in every restitution case like this?   Well, I'm not sure a sentencing court is well equipped to do it. A sentencing court has to call appraisers?   Do you agree that if the real property is returned and that everybody agrees that on the day the property is returned, the value is less than the loan amount, that the victim is entitled to the difference between that value and the loan amount?   Then we are under B and then we are talking about money and not the mortgaged property.   Money is property. We're still talking about the value of the loan valued in terms of money and not of the real property, right? Otherwise, your concession that the victim is entitled to the difference can't work.   The victim is entitled to the difference in the value of the property and the amount of money stolen based, on your view, on the value of the property at the time that it's returned, correct?   Then we are under B, correct?   Thank you.
12-929 +++$+++        Is -- is it common in the treatises or in the cases to say that a forum selection clause is a venue provision?     I thought venue was something that Congress determined.       So what -       1390(c)?       Can I ask -       May I?     In a forum non conveniens motion, they say, oh, the witnesses are some places, what is the statutory and/or Federal Rules of Civil Procedure basis for forum non conveniens?       You just cite Gulf Oil, and that's it?
12-930 +++$+++    So you interpret automatic to include immediate?   So that -- that's an expectation argument? I mean, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, but is that the point you're making?
12-9490 +++$+++    Correct me if -- if I'm wrong. I might be missing something. The tip in J.L. was not a -- did not assert that a crime was being committed, so there was something suspicious. There was no crime in possession of the gun. Or correct me if I'm wrong.   But -- but here -- here, there was -- the report was a crime. Or is that not a correct distinction?   Well   But -- but the tip, in and of itself, did not indicate that a crime was being committed, which is different from this case.   No, I'm talking about an interpretation of what the tip said.   No, a Terry stop.   You might have had grounds for a Terry stop.   Well, I -- I think there's a difference, but I think, for our purposes, we can assume that the cases are comparable in that respect --   -- but not comparable, perhaps, in others.   You get an A for consistency. I'm -- I'm not sure about common sense. (Laughter.)   What is your position what you would do if you were on this Court, with those hypotheticals? What is your position that should happen in those two hypotheticals?   What is your position as to what the Court should do in those cases?   I understand it, but we're interested in a hypothetical.   In this case, your -- your grade for consistency depends on this answer. (Laughter.)   Your grade for consistency depends on this answer.
12-96 +++$+++        I suppose the thrust of the questions so far has been if you would be covered under any formula that most likely would be drawn, why are you injured under this one?       But that's -- that's the hypothesis.     If you could be covered under most suggested formulas for this kind of statute, why are you injured by this one?     I think that's the thrust of the question.       Well, some of --       Some of the questions asked to this point I think mirror what the government says toward the end of its brief, page 48 and page 49. It's rather proud of this reverse engineering:     We really knew it was some specific States we were interested in, and so we used these old categories to cover that State. Is that a methodology that in your view is appropriate under the test of congruence and -- and proportionality?       Suppose -- suppose there were and suppose that's the rationale because that's what I got from the government's brief and what I'm getting -- getting from some of the questions from the bench.     What is wrong with that?       Well, and -- and I don't know why -- why you even go that far.     I don't know why under the equal footing doctrine it would be proper to just single out States by name, and if that, in effect, is what is being done, that seemed to me equally improper.     But you don't seem to make that argument.       I would like to hear the answer to the question.       Your time is --       -- about ready to expire for the rebuttal period.     But I do have this question:     Can you tell me -- it seems to me that the government can very easily bring a Section 2 suit and as part of that ask for bail-in under Section 3.     Are those expensive, time-consuming suits?     Do we have anything in the record that tells us or anything in the bar's experience that you could advise us?       Is this an effective remedy?
12-98 +++$+++        I don't want to take up too much time talking about Andrews, but it seems to me that what the North Carolina Supreme Court said in Andrews is that in those States where there is a prior determination, that controls, but the -- North Carolina is entitled to adopt a different procedure and have a one-third across-the-board rule. That's the way I read it.       Does -- does that accord with your understanding?       Yes.
12-99 +++$+++       I -- I think there's substantial force to that argument.    But can we talk just about property just for a minute, just in the abstract?    Isn't it true that what you have might become property when you trade it?    If you take a picture of a celebrity on a street, that's your right to do so.    But you can't sell it.    Maybe that's not quite the -- the right analogy.    But here, what, as you point out, is fairly standard in labor relations, has been turned into property, arguably, by the parties. Could the parties say that we'll pay you - the employer say we'll pay you $100,000 to get out of the recognition agreement?    That would be property in an economist sense.    Now, it might be a violation of the Labor Act.      But in the abstract, wouldn't that be property?      And isn't the thing that's exchanged for the money also property?      I'm just talking about common definition, our common agreement as to what property means.      So suppose the company manufactures widgets and the union says, we'll spend $100,000 advertising your widgets if you so -- if you sign the recognition agreement.      Is that lawful?      I don't -- I think this is slightly different from Justice Kagan, but can you give us some indication of how often employers make these agreements?    That's probably a hard statistic to -- to collect because there are so many variables.      Well, that's true of all property owners.    I have a right to waive my right to exclude you from the property.    That's -- that's property -- that's a property right.    And -- and it can become so when I -- when I charge for it.      Are you saying "thing of value" means something different in 302 than it means elsewhere in -- in the code?      I -- I can see if there was a conspiracy to extort these benefits, that the government would take the position that there was a crime because there was a thing of value, a thing of property.
12-992 +++$+++    It does make sense. We held that or just circuit courts?   I can see how, if you're talking about lawyers' fees pretrial and lawyers' fees at the trial, that they would be interconnected, that it would be improper for the jury to hear about either, if there were a jury. But -- what about the auditor's fees? Can you -- is there an argument that would support your side, but I'm not sure there is the argument, that auditor fees are also -- have an effect on what the attorneys' fees are or should be.   Or are they really quite compartmentalized?   No, but I'm asking if there's a relation between the two.   And to the extent auditors have done a certain amount of work, then there should be no duplicative attorneys' fees, so the judge considers both together.   And the trial court needs to know the amount of the pretrial fees and the -- and what they were incurred for, so that he doesn't give duplicative recovery when he provides for attorneys' fees for the course of the trial.
13-115 +++$+++    Could you get oblige us by answering Justice Scalia's guestion. Forget clearly established. What do you think the law is or ought to be? If the only motive for the officer's action, for the Secret Service action, is one based on viewpoint discrimination, but that nonetheless there was an objective reason that could have justified the action, what should the outcome be there as a matter of law? Forget clearly established.   So you -- so you say that any time there is an objective basis for the Secret Service to act to move a protester, the fact that this wasn't the motive at all, but that it was viewpoint discrimination is irrelevant.   Is that your position or is it not?   Well, on  on the merits of the case, if you were called to brief the Secret Service, what would you say in response to this question: Do we have any duties under the First Amendment when we are protecting the President with respect to crowds and -- and people that are close to him? Do we have any First Amendment duty?   They're asking about a law, they say we want to know what the law is. We're law enforcement officers. Will you please tell us what the law is.   They said that's why we've invited you to lunch, so that you will tell us what the law is. (Laughter.)   Could I --   -- have an answer to this guestion, please?   Would you say that under your view of the case, that there is a First Amendment interest that protesters have, but that it is virtually unenforceable in the context of crowd control?   Because it seems to me that if this complaint doesn't survive, nothing will.   And so, your answer to Justice Kagan is that it would be proper if you have only 15 minutes, a limited amount of time, to move the people with the -- with the adverse -- with the signs that criticize the President?   So your answer to Justice Kagan is that there is no violation if they move just the Bush protesters. That's your answer.
13-132 +++$+++    Just  just to test the principle for why the police can search and seize some -- some objects. Consider a gun. The arrestee has a gun on his person and the police take the gun. Is part of the reason for that seizure to obtain evidence of the crime or is it just for the safety of the officer and the safety of the community?   What about gathering evidence in order to make the case? For instance, with the gun, could they take fingerprints? The -- the gun is in the police station where the arrestee is being booked. A, could they take fingerprints? B, could they copy the serial number? C, could they see how many shells were left in the chamber? They obviously have to empty it for safety purposes. All for the purpose of building the case, of -- of obtaining evidence?   So -- so if -- if the proposition then, if the principle then is that some objects that are obtained from the arrestee can be examined in order to build the State's case, is that at least a beginning premise that we can accept in your case, although, obviously, there are problems of the extent and intrusiveness of the search that are -- are in your case, but not in the gun hypothetical.   I think you're right that Gant is probably the best statement in support of the principle that I've -- I've suggested, and then you might say, well, that's limited to automobiles --   -- and then we're back where we started.   Well, but the -- but in the wallet -- we'll just stick with Justice Alito's hypothetical -- they find a business card or something which shows a car rental service. Can they turn the card over and read it? They're not looking for a pin or an explosive. They're trying to read what's on the card. Can they do that?   No, they turn -- they turn the card over.   Do you think you could have obtained a warrant -- or that the police could have obtained a warrant in this case?   All right.   Well, then the evidence that's seizable under the warrant is -- is reasonable, and Justice Alito points out the fact that some of this evidence is -- is reasonable. If there's a -- there's a limitation with reference to the way the police behaved, as Justice Alito points out, it's limited just to this evidence.   Well, but it -- it just goes to the fact that this -- that this is searchable under Fourth Amendment standards.   There -- there is not much authority that I could find, if the lawyer is arrested and -- and they want to read his whole briefcase or you want to read a year's diary. And you cite -- I think it's page 7 of your brief -- the Learned Hand 1916 case. Is that about the best discussion you -- you can find? I didn't find anything much different.   Right.   Because it's important if we're going to try to formulate some standard which limits the extent of the search, and that's one of -- that's one of the problems in this case. If -- if say we rule for the government in its case, maybe it's not quite fair to ask you, but if we rule for the government in its case in Wurie, for the Federal case --   -- and there's no -- it's not an exigent circumstances, is there some standard where we could draw the line which would still result in a judgment in -- in your favor? Maybe that's not quite a fair question. You're not -- you're not answering -- you're not arguing the -- the government's case.   Well, including the criminals who are more dangerous, more sophisticated, more -- more elusive with cell phones. That's the -- that's the other side of this.
13-193 +++$+++    And I take it that's -- that's enforced by subpoenas. If the speaker doesn't want to appear before the Commission, he can be served with a subpoena, which is judicially enforceable.   Now, the State can characterize its own position, but do you understand the State to say that well, the existence of the Commission means that frivolous claims can be washed out, that they can actually get some protection by an advance ruling. Is that the State's position?   But I mean, I thought ~ I thought their position was that this would -- would sharpen the controversy and make it more concrete or something like that.   Your best cases you think are Steffel and Thompson and Babbitt? Are there others that are more --   Any -- any breakdown of whether those were brought by candidates or just interested citizens?
13-298 +++$+++    And just repeat, it is common ground between the parties that --   Well, let me put it this way. If you describe that to a second-year college class in engineering and said here's -- here's my idea, now you go home and you program over this weekend, my guess is -- my guess is that that would be fairly easy to program.   So the fact that the computer is involved, it -- it seems to me, is necessary to make it work. But the -- but the innovative aspect is certainly not in the creation of the program to make that work. All you're talking about is -- if I can use the word -- an "idea."   Or -- or a method or a process.    is  is whether or not you could have patented that system, idea, process, method, without attaching a computer program.   Suppose I thought  and, again, it's just a thought because I don't have the expertise -- that any computer group of people sitting around a coffee shop in Silicon Valley could do this over a weekend. Suppose I thought that.     Then why is the computer program necessary to make the patent valid?   But that's just an idea, hey, let's use a computer.   If we say that -- If we say that there's no software patentability and agree with the Attorney General, do you lose in this case?   Is there any common ground between you and the government -- maybe a better question to ask the government -- a common ground between you and the government on something in the software area that's patentable, other than making the computer itself work? You understand the government to say no software patents.
13-299 +++$+++    It's true, I think, that the Respondents have to explain why their position doesn't commit us to a difficult case-by-case adjudication down the line, and yours is a more simple approach. On the other hand, it seems to me that you really rendered the words "retirement funds" superfluous.   I mean, the words in the bankruptcy statute.   So all we have is the statute on one hand and common sense on the other.   Well, if we -- if we look -- if we look to what the States did, are there some statements, some recitation of purpose that does weigh in on the common sense side of the equation in your favor; in other words, the States were doing this for some --for some particular reason?
13-301 +++$+++    Well, let -- let's assume that it is inappropriate for the IRS to avoid taxpayer -- tax court limitations on discovery. Let's assume that a subpoena cannot do that. The Supinski declaration, it seems to me, is quite sufficient to make that showing.   But my supposition was that assume that you cannot avoid taxpayer -- or tax court discovery limits. If -- if that is so, it seems to me the Supinski affidavit is quite sufficient.   Just so -- just so I  I know what your position is in this case and your answer to the Chief Justice, is it your contention that on this showing, that on these affidavits, a district court may not order a hearing?   All right. So you say that the district court -- that there is a sufficient showing here so that a district court, in the exercise of its discretion, could order a further hearing.
13-316 +++$+++    Why  why is that? Why would Congress have wanted to make that difference?   I agree with you that the disparity in -- in punishment is guite substantial.   It does -- it does seem to me that this case can be distinguished from the example you gave in your yellow brief of the person that sells a magazine subscription and he gets the check and he never intends to deliver the magazines. In that case, the bank will -- will honor the check, I assume.   And that's guite different than this case.   Well, you can do so, I suppose, through the government's proposed fallback position.   -- at page 40 of its brief which talks about a risk of loss.   Well, I think it does a lot of work because it -- it takes out of the equation schemes to defraud where the bank is not going to be liable.
13-317 +++$+++    Finish your sentence. "And that cannot" --   Would you address briefly the position taken by the law professors, I call it the midway position, that says there should be an event study. That might not take care of your first two arguments of the narrow construction of 10 (b) (5), and the question of presumptions, but it does seem to me to be a substantial answer to your economic analysis to the -- to the challenge you make to the economic premises of the Basic decision.   Am -- am I correct -- and this would be more of a question for your friend representing the Respondent. Am I correct that, even under the -- the Basic framework, at the merits stage there has to be something that looks very much like an event study. Am I correct about that?   And so then the question would be since you're going to have to have it anyway, why not have it at the class certification stage.   Can you tell me, based on your experience, compare the -- the cost, the extent of time, the difficulty of showing under Basic the efficient -- that there is an efficient market, and compare and contrast that with undertaking an event study. Is the latter much more costly, much more time-consuming?
13-339 +++$+++    Yes. It didn't turn on the label in part because -- I was looking at the opinion -- it talks about a statute of limitations. So that -- that helps the other side, although the repose period helps you.
13-354 +++$+++    You were beginning by giving us a framework for your argument. Do I think of this as a statutory case? Of course, the First Amendment is on the stage at some point here, but I take it you can prevail just on the question of statutory interpretation, and if that is so, are there any statutory rules that work in your favor, that is to say, avoiding a constitutional question or how do we think about this case, primarily as a statutory case?   But why -- why is that a problem? Let's assume that the cost of providing insurance is roughly equivalent to the $2,000 penalty. How -- how is the employer hurt? He can just raise the wages.   Okay, the last is important. But just assume hypothetically that it's a wash, that the employer would be in about the same position if he paid the penalty and the employer -- pardon me, an employee went out and got the insurance and that the employee's wages were raised slightly and then it's -- and that it's a wash so far as the employer are concerned, other than the employer's religious objection, but just on the financial standpoint. Can we assume that as a hypothetical. Then what would your case be?   Just before your time starts to go too fast, how would you suggest that we think about the position and the rights of the -- of the employees? And you can have hypotheticals about the employer makes them -- wants to make them wear burkas and so forth. That's not in this case. But in -- in a way, the employees are in a position where the government, through its healthcare plans, is -- is, under your view, is -- is allowing the employer to put the employee in a disadvantageous position. The employee may not agree with these religious -- religious beliefs of the employer. Does the religious beliefs just trump? Is that the way it works?
13-369 +++$+++    Would this -- would this help? Do you agree that the standard at the PTO, and let's say that it's whether or not -- the claim is definite if a person skilled in the art would be reasonably certain of its scope. Is the standard used by the PTO the same standard that the CA Fed ought to use?   All right. How does -- that's a sensible answer, I think. Now, how does the presumption of validity bear on -- on the application of the -- of that same standard in the court of appeals?   Doesn't that imply some deference on findings of fact?   Does it imply  what sort of deference does it accord to the PTO?   That is, the presumption of validity, does that accord some deference to the PTO? And how would that apply or not apply here?   So there's no deference to the PTO as to that legal interpretation.
13-461 +++$+++    I had the same question. Just assume that CableVision is our precedent. I know that it isn't, but let's just assume that it is. How would you distinguish the CableVision from your case and how is it applicable here? Assume that it's binding precedent. Just that's a hypothetical.   How do you want us to deal with CableVision -- the CableVision case in the Second Circuit? Again assume it's a binding precedent. Just assume that.
13-483 +++$+++    Yes. What's an example of a subpoena that reguires the employee to testify, but that he's not testifying on public matters?   But my hypothetical is there is a subpoena, you are reguired to testify.   And then you've -- you indicate that there are some matters on which the employee is not -- not protected.   What is an example of that?   I  I still can't get the hypothetical. What -- what am I --   I -- I just can't imagine a case that's not -- not a matter of public interest. Now, I can assume that if -- if the employee indicates that he was dishonest or if he indicates that he's clearly incompetent, some of the hypotheticals given in the early argument, I understand that. But so far as the subject matter, it's the subject matter is of public concern. Necessarily, if it's a subpoena, is it not, or am I wrong?   But that was Justice Kagan's gualification. That's the Pickering balance.
132, Orig. +++$+++           Did it misspend that money?   Are you saying the money was misspent?         What is there in the record that shows that the claims of the States are identical to the claim the Commission is asserting, which was the -- which was the instance in the Arizona-California case?            It seems to me that it's the obligation of the Commission to show that there is an absolute parallel between the claims.             And I just don't see where I can infer from the record or conclude that that is the case.             And if -- and if that is not so, then the Commission is not like the Indian tribes in the Arizona case.         Well, I am conscious of your white light, but it does seem to me --         -- that the Commission is -- is asking for the money for itself.
134 ORIG +++$+++              Well, are you asking us to reject the concept of concurrent jurisdiction in all circumstances?             And in your view to what extent does this involve subaqueous lands toward -- and I'll just put "toward" -- the New Jersey side?             I'm not sure I understand your position on where New Jersey's jurisdiction begins and ends with reference to subaqueous lands.              But that's -- Article I -- that's an exception.      And you don't have the benefit of that exception when you're talking about Article VII.              The exception is not that specific as to the -- as to the extent of the jurisdiction.               You are saying that the --               You are saying that the concept of "riparian rights" displaces the police power, to a large extent.
137, Orig. +++$+++        But why doesn't the language in article V(A) -- and this is not too helpful -- simply restate the issue before us, what is a beneficial use by the upstream owner?       But all that shows is - or might show in a particular case, is that the amount of water is reduced.     Now the -- then the question is have the senior appropriators or the upstream appropriators reduced it in a way that's inconsistent or that's an overuse of their beneficial rights, and you're right -- again right where we started from.     And then you have to regulate exactly how each irrigator is using the appropriative right.       So the -- so the flows don't necessarily answer the question.       I thought you referred us, just while you're going through your notes, to page 82, and there's an intriguing footnote where the Special Master talks about his own -- his own book.     But that doesn't seem to me to be conclusive on your point, because he's saying the area is confused.     And his point -- it seems to me it brings up what the special -- I'm taking over your answer to Justice Scalia's question. It is page 82, footnote -       There's a footnote on that page, yes.       Do you have ultimate liability to Montana -- pardon me -- to North Dakota for -- for overuse?       Well, I won't -- I won't get into that, but it does seem to me that the Chief Justice asked the question, if you're entitled to take the water, you can use it for any purpose.     I -- I take it the answer to that is it has to be a beneficial use, it has to be for approximately the same crop, but that brings us to this -- to this gray area that the Special Master refers to on page 82 as confusing.     And I think -- was it page 65 -- he talks about this is a confusing area of the law. What is your best authority for your position?     What is the best authority?     Do you have a case or a -- a paragraph in a treatise that's -       The Utah case is your best case?
138, Orig. +++$+++               I see your light's on, but can we take this case on the assumption that nothing that you obtain in the way of relief will affect Duke Power under the comprehensive relicensing agreement?               Don't we have to take the case on the assumption that their rights under that agreement might be affected?               But are you saying you are not seeking a result that s inconsistent in any way with that agreement?
