04-10566 +++$+++          The question --         Suppose they don't do it. They don't do it.        They violated the treaty.         We assume that.   Then the question is, what is a proper remedy?       And I'll assume with you, for the moment, that -- that the treaty has to be read as saying you have to have some kind of appropriate remedy, but it doesn't say what kind.                  So why isn't it an appropriate remedy that he was given a lawyer, if he wanted one, and the lawyer either told him about the right to talk to the consul or he didn't.                  And if he didn't -- if he did, he found out, and if he didn't and it mattered, maybe that was ineffective assistance of counsel.         So if we have ineffective assistance of counsel claims to take care of the tough cases where it really did matter, doesn't that suffice under the treaty, or does it?       Oh, he's stuck without an attorney.         I have no doubt about that.           I have no doubt that the treaty was violated.              I follow you that far, but now you're talking about the domestic court's power to do what there is an international obligation to do, which is to create a remedy.              I'm not sure why that remedy need always be suppression.         I think sometimes it could be something else.           Why -- the ultimate question I think is the one Justice Alito asked.                   I think, as I read the ICJ treaty, we're under a legal obligation in this country to provide a reasonable, effective remedy. And why isn't that a reasonably effective remedy?                   Treat it, you know, like any other problem where the client should have learned something and he didn't.                   If the lawyer is there, this is the obligation.                  The lawyer tells him, and if the lawyer fails to tell him, then that's ineffective assistance in an appropriate circumstance, or if it isn't, it isn't.               But that's a good remedy. What's wrong with that? And the other obligation is, counsel, you have to raise this issue as soon as everybody learns about it, in which case you might be out because I don't -- he's certainly learned about it by the time he was on appeal, and as I read your brief here, he didn't raise it on appeal either.           Yes.       He said -- when I read that motion, which I'll do -- so it's in the record?       Where?       Do I have it in front of me somewhere?       Okay.      Now, in other words, he did raise it.           Okay.      If he did raise it, then maybe he would be entitled to this relief.       But is -- my general question is, is that approach sufficient under the law?       Say, in an appropriate case, I can't find a rule for every case -- but that our obligation, as interpreted by the ICJ, is that we have, as the law of the land, a treaty that says you tell the person about his Vienna Convention right, and if you don't, now says the ICJ, there has to be some kind of -- of effective remedy.             Now, assuming that's the law of the United States, why isn't this approach an effective remedy?       There -- there are rules on conflicts of interest too, you know.                   So following our normal rules, is there any country, is there any international law, is there anything in American law that would suggest, in respect to any kind of significant procedural failure, that the State has to do more than we're just talking about?       And if so, what is it?       Anywhere.         I -- I just think --       -- think for our most severe violations, we provide an approach that you tell the lawyer.        The lawyer brings it up.          If the lawyer doesn't bring it up and it's important or there's a conflict of interest or something terrible is going on, normally you'd say that's ineffective assistance.                      And I just wonder if that approach doesn't work here.       Well, I'm not interested in, now at the moment, whether it does or does not work.                        I want to know if there's any country or anywhere else in American law or international law where people have gone further than that.           And there might be.          I'm asking it seriously.       I'm not talking about a procedural default rule.            I'm talking about the system that was suggested.       Yes, the procedural default rule would mean you get procedurally defaulted if you fail to bring it up, but I think you might say if you failed to bring it up the first time that the lawyer knew about it.           And if it's his fault for not bringing it up or he should have known about it, then he's out -- the client.           But if it's not, he's not out.

04-1084 +++$+++           But suppose we --          -- I grant you that administrative considerations are relevant.                  Of course they're relevant.           But that's far from saying they're determinative.            And then we're back to what Justice Souter said, absolutely relevant in deciding the compelling interest, but the fact that peyote seems to have been administered without the sky falling in suggests that, here, they're not determinative.                 That's all.       Well, the --       -- part of the Treaty question that I had is also -- this is a root that you are -- and it contains DMT.          And the Treaty doesn't ban everything that contains DMT -- for example, pineapple and bananas. The question is the ratio of the DMT to the entire plant.        And that sounds like a factual question that ought to be developed.        Pineapples, we -- what about those?        I drank pineapple --        -- juice this morning. [Laughter.]           Well, that's actually why I've been looking.             I'm bothered by it, because it -- if the Treaty is absolute, we reserve for peyote, which would mean the religious use of peyote by the Native American tribes is exempt, but other people who have identical religions, use identical substances, they're stuck.                     And that, it seems to me, is a rather rough problem under the First Amendment.       One religion singled out.        And, therefore, I'm looking for some way in this Treaty not to reach that conclusion --       --      for the constitutional reason.
04-1131 +++$+++           Well, somebody will be if it s random.             If you have thousands of people, somebody will be if it is random.                If there were nobody who was picked seven times, that would show it wasn t random. So, you know --           -- whether he has a good constitutional claim here I guess is rather doubtful --           What are they?    How many people are there?            How many people are tested if you try to calculate it?             How many --           -- in the Federal Government?           All you do is you get a bell curve and you ask the Library of Congress and they ll do it --           No.     It s -- it s not hard to do.           But the -- the --           All right.        Regardless, this is beside the point. I -- all right.         Can I -- I just want you at some point to get to not just the constitutional question.         Maybe he can go in and raise his claim.                I don t know if he should have exhausted or not, et cetera.           But I find it hard, in reading this, to believe the following.                      Like any other worker, I mean, normally you have a collective bargaining agreement, and the union takes up your minor thing.       And here, what you re saying is although if it s a major thing, like a personnel action, there s a special thing where you get in -- you know, you -- you get into court way down the road.                    It s very complicated.             This individual, even though he classifies it as a grievance where the union is supposed to take it up and the union tells him we re not going to take it up, we don t believe in your claim, that then he can run in to a Federal judge. Now, that -- that I find surprising, and I d like you to explain how in your theory that works.       Well, why isn t the thing to do here -- I -- I see that you are raising a significant question in respect to -- at least in my view, in respect to the -- an action that violates a regulation that violates a statute.                    Leave the Constitution aside, but it might violate a number of practices, good practices, et cetera.                   But why isn t focusing on that the thing for the plaintiff here to do is he goes to the union -- I m just reading from page 6 and 7 of your brief -- and he says, I would like you to invoke arbitration?         And they might do it.            Now, if they do it and it comes out a way they don t like, he then -- they might file exceptions and they might win. But what you re worried about is if they don t win or if they don t do it, they can go to court only if it involved an unfair labor practice or a major adverse personnel action.                That s what s worrying you, I take it.           Well, why isn t it, at that stage if he doesn t get into court, you then say that that isn t true?             They should be able to come to court in other instances as well, making the same kinds of arguments that you re making now.           You -- you -- I -- I believe that there are millions of instances, perhaps.                Now, I m -- when I think something like this, I m quite often wrong.             But I thought that the reason that exhaustion is required is not always because statutes require it.              It s partly because of the word final in the APA, which applies here as well, and it s also because of the common law of administrative law that requires people to exhaust their remedies.          But it s not rewriting.          I mean -- I mean, it s perhaps.          All right.        You think -- fine. The -- the -- but the -- the issue it seems that could be dispositive of this, in respect to the non-constitutional claims -- and this is why I want to get your response -- is simply that it is a fair implication from Congress having set up on non- constitutional matters a system of arbitration to require your client to go through that system before seeking to get review of the non-constitutional matters in a Federal district court.               Now, that s the normal rule in administrative law.             What is the argument that it wouldn t apply in your case?       Now you want us to hold you don t have judicial review --       -- under the statute.       No, but the answer -- please, I didn t mean to cut off your answer.       I want to hear your answer to the question that if I agree with you that on non- constitutional matters, if this system doesn t work for your client, he gets review in a Federal district court.       Suppose I agree with you on that.            What is the argument against requiring him to exhaust the remedy that is there, namely a request for arbitration --       -- as an implication from the statute?       All right.         Now, is there any other claim -- any other answer to the argument other than they waived it?       What?       Did I -- could you give -- give the same answer --       -- in respect to your constitutional claim?          Why, given the presence of section 705 of the act --       -- one s -- forget it.       Your time is up.         That s --
04-1140 +++$+++          I want to know what it is you're arguing for.           That is, I -- when I get through all these words in the attorneys-fees cases, I've got it in my mind that, like the civil rights statute, they say, "You normally get fees, unless you shouldn't."           All right?        That means you're normally gonna to get them.         The plaintiff, anyway. All right?          Then we have a case with a copyright. The copyright says it's all the way up to the district court, really, which means a grab-bag, and what the particular judge thinks is fair in the instance.          And I guess you could have a rule saying, "You hardly ever get fees."                 So, in my mind, I got it, "Well, who knows?" and, "No, you almost always do," or, "No, you almost always don't."                  Now, is that a good characterization?                 And what -- which one of those three are you arguing for?         I know you're not arguing for "You always don't." [Laughter.]        All right.        Then, which one do you want?          Do you want the thing --        Yes.        All right.        Now, if you want "you always get them," in the civil liberties cases there is a good policy reason, according to the court, underlying that judgment of how Congress wanted to give this to people to vindicate civil liberties.          I've never heard of a policy of closing the Federal court door, because if, in fact, you were to have that rule in this case, it would simply discourage people from removing it in cases where they think they have a good claim to remove it, because they'd have to pay huge costs if they were wrong.        So, I'm not aware of any closing doors of Federal court policy.        Now I --        -- unfortunately, I guess, from your position, I don't know what Congress meant here.        Therefore, I'm trying to figure it out in terms of the policy --        -- as well as the language.          Okay, in terms of the policy, I'm simply saying that I don't know why you have a better claim than a copyright plaintiff, and I can think of why you don't have as good a claim as a civil rights plaintiff, the reason I said.               So, what is your response to that?
04-1144 +++$+++            Let's just imagine a real circumstance.             A 15 year-old walks in 2:00 in the morning on Saturday into the emergency room and the doctor looks at her, she's pregnant, she has this very high blood pressure, whatever.                         And the doctor thinks to himself, he thinks, well, immediate abortion, no question, immediately deliver the child. If I don't, I don't think she's going to die but she'll never have children. And he's thinking that.              What's supposed to happen?          He calls up Pam Pevagoglio or Pam Livingston and there is no answer.                      It's 2:00 in the morning and there is one of those things, leave a message, okay?             Should I call your parents?              No. They don't know I'm pregnant.                   Now, what's supposed to happen?        What does the lawyer say? Okay?       What's the provision that saves him?           There is no health exemption in this statute.        How do we know?    I mean, what you're saying is fine, but how do we know that that's actually the law?             I mean, there are a lot of people who absolutely in very good faith would say that it isn't competing harm.               They would say that the competing right that the life of the fetus is more important than the possibility of the mother having children in the future herself. See, there are people in good faith on both sides of this argument.               And so how do we know that the New Hampshire statute is going to do -- not the statute, but your competing harms defense is going to do for this particular woman what a health exception would do?          Now, that's exactly -- I'm leaving aside your fraction test, your 100 percent test, because I don't think they capture all the considerations that are relevant.                     Focus on what you just said.            What you've done is you've tried to create an injunction that will separate out the sheep from the goats, all right?                The goats are only 1 percent and the sheep -- But what does it say? I don't think you can say enjoin the bypass procedure, because if you enjoin the bypass procedure, there goes down the drain your whole parental notification because you can't have parental notification without a bypass procedure. I don't think you can say enjoin emergencies because to do that, you're going to have to get into the greatest difficult issue there is in this area, which is what does that health exception mean.       And we've said throughout that that health exception has to be defined first by a legislature. So if you tell me how to write that injunction, then I'll be able to decide whether it's possible for a court just to say, okay, we only enjoin the goats as opposed to saying, legislature, this is basically up to you, the whole area.        The word leafletting is not as fuzzy around the edges as health exception, given the fact that lots of people think health exception is a way of getting abortion on demand.
04-1152 +++$+++        The constitutional argument, I guess, is, "Does the Constitution require access -- is -- does it permit a statute which says you have to give access to the military, when you wouldn't give access to any other employer?"       All right.        Now --       So, then what you're saying, it     --       -- and then what's the answer to that question, "Does the Constitution" -- how does the -- what's the answer?         Yes, but it is an important question, because the -- there is an amicus brief that says, "Go read the statute."                  And, really, the statute was not about homosexuals in the military, it was a statute about universities in Vietnam not letting military people on campus.                 So, in the -- at the heart of the statute was a matter which was unique to the military.          Now, this is a matter that isn't unique to the military.             So, why not interpret the statute in the way that the amicus brief suggests in order to avoid a difficult constitutional question?
04-1170 +++$+++        And can -- can you go back to Justice Souter's question for a minute?             Because the way I'm thinking about this, I'm making two assumptions that I'd like you to make:                 first, that there could be such a case, which I very much doubt, but -- but this is a lawyer's hypothetical, this whole thing, in a sense.       But I'll make the assumption there could be such a case.             Second, I will assume that our case law leaves this open, a matter that can be argued. But suppose that we do make that assumption for the moment.             Then what I'm thinking of is this made-up case is the case of the following.                 We have aggravating factors and break them down into molecules on a scale, and for every molecule of aggravation here, there is a molecule of mitigation there, so that the juror who is very conscientious ends up with the same number of molecules of equal weight on this scale.                   And in our made-up instance, Kansas says, if that's the situation, you must say death. Now, if that's the case, how would you reconcile that with a view of the eighth amendment that says if you're going to sentence someone to death, there has to be something special about his case that means it's somewhat worse than the ordinary case because, after all, for every molecule of specialness that warranted death, we have a molecule of mitigation that doesn't? So that's where I am, trying to get the cases out of it and trying to take very seriously the hypothetical that is before us.        Well, you see, my hypothetical is designed to cut free of the language of the cases.          I have no doubt you can go through the language and show that.            And it's designed to say, but the very point of those cases is you do not send someone to death unless the jury decides that the circumstances here make him somewhat worse, at least one molecule worth of worse, than the typical person. And given the evenness of the balance, I don't see how we can say that, though I grant you, when you go back to those words in the cases, you're right.       No, do it.        Do it. Make the reasoned moral choice.               And the facts are that we have, because of the balancing, molecules or not -- we have by the balancing made a determination that anything for the bad that distinguishes this person from the ordinary is -- is equally balanced by the good.       Now, make the moral choice.       What is the reason?
04-1186 +++$+++ 
04-1203 +++$+++          Is this relevant to the -- I just saw these as -- I -- just by chance, it - - one of the cases in the SG's brief involved Georgia juvenile facilities, where mentally ill patients were restrained, hit, shackled, put in restraint chairs for hours, sprayed with pepper spray.         And that seemed to be one instance coming out of Georgia.
04-1244 +++$+++        Is it -- you just -- on your list, I had the impression, but tell me if I'm right or wrong, that there's a specific statute dealing with abortion clinics now, though there wasn't when this case began.       So that if --        -- Operation Rescue did the same kind of thing now that they did then, the Petitioners in -- the plaintiffs in this case would be able to get relief under that statute.             Is that right or wrong?
04-1264 +++$+++        No, no.       I mean, the question is, I take it, in most of the arbitration associations, once you have arbitration, you will get paid even though -- the arbitrator will be paid, won t he, whether --       -- he decides one way or the other?       So he has no particular interest in getting paid in upholding the contract or not.            They can logically because they say the arbitration clause, when embedded in a contract that is voidable -- i.e., A and B enter into a contract.          B says it s voidable.             I void it.   I void it.      And there they say, fine, there was a contract and therefore this arbitration clause, which is separable -- you go to arbitration.                 But if it s void, where B doesn t have to say I void it, I void it, you never had a contract in the first place.                    Now, that is a logical position.
04-1324 +++$+++         Your position is, it should be like any other civil case.        You can raise it sua sponte, we've said, in exceptional circumstances.        I don't know what they are.        And if --        -- they're not there --        -- then the judge could say, "You know, I'm surprised that you haven't raised statute of limitations."        And then the lawyer for the State says, "Oh, my goodness.               Quite right.   We'd like to amend."        And we don't --        -- have to decide --        Why, just out of curiosity -- I'm not familiar with the actual practice of a lot of civil cases, but when somebody -- let's say the defendant in an ordinary tort case forgets to put in the statute of limitations, and the case is all tried and finished.          At the very end, he says, "Oh, my God." And now he goes in and asks to amend it under Rule 15. 	 Do judges normally say, "Fine"?         Because it's --
04-1327 +++$+++         Suppose that everything in this case were the same.            Everything is identical except what the court of appeals or the State supreme court holds is that we think under rule 403, which happens to be the rule in our State, the probative value doesn't warrant admissibility in light of the risk of prejudice.         But everything else is the same.        Now, in your opinion is that constitutional?        Yes.        Because?        Well, what they'll say --        -- if they want to build it out, is they'll say, look, there -- there is DNA evidence here.         It's absolutely conclusive, and all that the light -- the -- the only doubt of the -- the defense has cast on it is they found that there was some opportunity that the police could have tampered with it.         That's true of 60 percent or so of all chain of custody cases, and that is not sufficient to overcome what it shows.             And therefore, it's not worth the jury's time and it'll prove very confusing to the jury. Now, why would that ruling under 403 be unconstitutional?        Good.     Now, that's what I want you to get to.        And the key points that suggest that what I just said is not a fair characterization or a correct characterization are?
04-1329 +++$+++         Well, why would the person want if he thought that?             I mean, why would a person want a patent if, in fact, he didn't think that it gave him the power to raise price above what the price would be in its absence?        Now, you see, you're talking about the wide -- you -- you say there are a lot of failed patents.          The person got it because he thought it would, but he shouldn't have because it actually made no difference.           There might be.       I don't know.           Well, there might be. There's a set of valueless patents.           And in respect to there being a valueless patent, the owner would not be able to raise the price over what it otherwise would be. And why not then make that a defense, that a person could say, I have a valueless patent, and he could introduce evidence to prove it?           Suppose it's the other one that's the critical one.           And the other one being that -- the attack on the problem is there happens to be instances where tying is justified for procompetitive reasons, risk-sharing, maintaining product quality, probably Jerrold Electronics.                  There are a number of them.       And the real problem is that the law hasn't admitted a defense.             But where the attack should be is on the tied product, not the tying product.                 What do you think of that?       And market power -- you mean price -- ability to charge a price higher than otherwise would be the case?       As you're defining it.       As you're defining.       Fine.      Then you're talking about patents where the person who paid for the attorney went to the Patent Office and so forth.                 That was just a mistake.       But then are you relying on that, the existence of valueless patents?       If you're going beyond that, which patents are you talking about?       No, I see.
04-1332 +++$+++        I guess it's true, is it -- I'm testing my own understanding of this -- that if, in fact, shall not apply meant anything in that chapter, if you had a State and that State gave a State law remedy for, say, detaining property or for loss of mail or something, then that State law remedy would continue in existence because the thing in the law that sets aside that State court remedy is a different part of the same chapter --       -- in 2679(b)?       But the whole point of the Westfall Act is to get rid of those State causes of action.       But the language does seem to say it.       All right.        Well, then -- then to get to the main point here, if we are going to get to that, the question that I would have for you is -- is the following.         If we accept your interpretation, it's pretty anomalous.           I mean, someone who brings his Bivens action first, of course, can sue the individual employee, and you agree to that.                But if he brings his Bivens action second, because he made a mistake and went into the wrong court or he brought the wrong action or it was a borderline case, frankly, and he didn't know how it would end up, that person is out of luck. Now, there's nothing in this statute that says that the Government -- that the Congress wanted to achieve that result.          What order you bring the suit in shouldn't really make any difference here.                The Bivens action is totally different from all the other tort actions in that respect, and it's listed separately in 2679 to make clear that it isn't -- it is different. So why?   I mean, why read it your way?           The burden that reading it their way would impose on the Government is minuscule.             The number of such suits is tiny, I would imagine. All right.   Now, what is wrong with my question?        A lot of things.        But you left out one word that I think is important there.                 To test it to see if I'm right about this is I thought 2679(b) was focusing in large part upon State tort suits.                    Is that right?        They wanted to get rid of the State tort suits --        -- in part.         Am I right about that or not?           All right.        So, therefore, if in fact we had words mean what they seem to mean, Congress would have both removed the State lawsuits in 2679(b) and reinstated them or set them in the exceptions.           But that would have the statute defeat itself, and therefore, that case that you're citing came to a correct result.           That's right?           Okay.      Don't tell me it's right if it's not right is all I want --           Okay.
04-1350 +++$+++               I can understand, I think, what a teaching is.      I take it a teaching is you put all the prior art -- that's what I guess that's what Judge Rich explained, which I thought was very enlightening to me in I can't remember the name of the case, Wigmore, Winsmore --              Winslow.        You put it all around the room.    All right, we've got it all around the room, and I begin to look at it and if I see over that it somehow teaches me to combine these two things, if it says, Breyer, combine this and that, that's a teaching and then it's obvious.        Now, maybe it doesn't have the teaching, it just has the suggestion.                    Maybe it says, we suggest you combine this or that; okay, then it's obvious.    But I don't understand, though I've read it about 15 or 20 times now, it though I've read it about 15 or 20 times now, I just don't understand what is meant by the term "motivation."              I tried.        You've read a lot of cases.   You're a patent lawyer, and so what is the understanding as best you have it of what is just meant by the term "motivation"?            To be more specific, if they mean motivated to go look to the prior art, well, anybody would want to look in the prior art.                   If I want to invent something I'll look anywhere.                   I'll look to the prior art.     I'll look to the Library of Congress. I'll look to my cousin.          I mean, I'll look wherever I can find it.     So they can't mean that, and if they don't mean that what do they mean?                 Say that again?      You wouldn't have a motivation to look to the prior art to find your problem.      What's an example where you have a motivation distinguishing you from everybody else?                  I mean, everybody has a motivation to look to the prior art.              Right person to ask. (Laughter.)              Fine, that's fine.             Why would that be?         I mean, I've worked out that the raccoons are gnawing the machine, at the bottom of the garage door and that's a problem.   So I move it to the top of the garage door. Does that suddenly -- nobody before thought of moving it to the top of the garage door; nobody before had thought of moving it to a different part that moves in a constant ratio with the accelerator.
04-1360 +++$+++         But that's -- that's actually what's disturbing me about this, because I thought the knock-and-announce rule was a rule that would allow a policeman to go in without knocking and announcing when he has reasonable grounds for thinking he might get shot if he didn't.               So, I -- as I read the briefs, I thought maybe that's not how it's being implemented, that the policemen are supposed to run the risk of being shot.               I didn't think that was the situation.               So, I'd appreciate your explaining that to me.          Would it be sufficient if the officer says, "One, this is a drug gang; two, they don't let people into the house whom they don't know; and, three, they have guns"?

04-1376 +++$+++            But is that --           -- so here?       I want to know, if your client had known about this law or gone to a lawyer and said, "What do I do now?" wouldn't the lawyer have said, or would he have said, "Just leave. Leave the country, quick, before you're caught.                    Now, when you get back to Mexico, you can apply and point out you've married an American citizen, and then you'll be able to come in, in all likelihood."                       And if I'm right about that, the Act does not attach new consequences to old behavior, it attaches new consequences to new behavior; namely, the act of staying within the United States, when you could leave.          I mean when this particular --          -- provision was passed --          -- a week later, he goes to a lawyer, and the lawyer says, "You'd better get out of here fast, because if you're caught while you're here, you're married now, and you won't be able to take advantage of that.           It would be terrible.              So, go to Mexico.        Then there is no problem."                 And if, in fact, I'm right, you see what I'm -- I find your argument excellent on the first part, but so is the Government's.            So, I think there's a kind of wash there, so I'm looking to the second part.                       And there, you're just said, it attaches new consequences to old behavior.         So, I'm asking you, if it doesn't attach the new consequences to old, but, necessarily, plus new behavior -- namely, remaining.       Well --       Being -- if you get married -- if you're outside the country and you marry an American, you're married to an American and you can't come in for 5 years?       As a result of --       -- the initial deporting order.       So, his choice is this Act or -- in which case, you never can get back, if you're caught -- or go to Mexico, wait 5 years.       Ten to 20 years?       No, no.       I mean, he either stays in the United States --       -- in 10 to 20 years --       Is caught.       If you lose this --       -- case -- if you lose this case, then his choice would be: stay here, get caught, and you never can come back, or 10 to 20 years?       I see.          Or go to Mexico, and you can come back in 5 years.          Okay.         So, a person who just leaves voluntarily, having reentered illegally, cannot come back for 5 years, no matter what, under 1156(a)(6)(B).         That was repealed.         Yes.       All right.
04-1414 +++$+++        So you just want us to say, look, the Ninth Circuit is wrong.                They're okay to have conditional warrants like this and there is no absolute rule you always have to have the triggering condition in.      As to whether this is too confusing or not too confusing, send them back and let them figure it out.
04-1477 +++$+++         How did they find him, by the way?        -- how in your opinion?        How did they find him?        No.    I'm not saying how did they?       How in your opinion should the Post Office Department or the government have found him?        So they find 13 people called Gary Jones or G. Jones in Little Rock.               Now, what do they do?        His wife is living in the house?        Were they divorced?        All right.      So he owns the house.       She doesn't.     She must not pay any taxes, and she sees these letters coming from him registered and says, oh, they're his problem.                 That's basically what could have happened.        If you have that kind of relationship with your wife, doesn't he have an obligation to watch what's going on?        Did they leave a notice?
04-1495 +++$+++         But you really want three things.        You say we want the protection, number one, of there -- if you're -- if there's probable cause, that's the end of it.         Number two, if you're trying to show there wasn't probable cause, you have to bear clear and convincing evidence, and number three, we also have qualified immunity.          And I guess, number four, you have to prove the whole thing by clear and convincing evidence.        It sounds a little bit like the person who has the overcoat, turns up the heat, you know, five or -- what about one?        What about this one?         And I want to know -- you simply say you need clear and convincing evidence that that was the motive and it wouldn't have been brought otherwise.                 And the existence of probable cause is a strong factor, maybe even a presumption, that suggests to the contrary. Now, have States and other places tried things like that without the world collapsing?        So as far as you know, every State and every jurisdiction where -- and investigators if they don't have absolutely immunity, whatever -- in all those jurisdictions, nobody has ever said that even a constitutional violation, if there's probable cause, that's the end of it.              Oh, I'm not focusing.              I want to know --              -- if --              We have no experience.    We don't know.            Okay.     As your -- as far as you can tell. The other question I have, which you might want to be brief about, is in looking through this record, as far as I could see from the briefs, they went ahead and prosecuted this man with only two pieces of evidence.           The first evidence was that he tore some pages out of his notebook.               But he introduced lots of notebooks to show he always tore pages out when he gave them to his secretary.             And the second was that he told some witnesses be very careful and answer the question. Now, you know, he said a few other things, but they all seemed like the kind of things that people would always say to witnesses. Now, if that's the only evidence, except for the fact he owns the company, how is there probable cause here?          Well, I didn't see any in the brief.          I saw a lot about other people in the brief, but not about him.          There are all kinds of things about other people.          I didn't --         I would like you to limit yourself to what I didn't concede.                     I concede it's his company.         I concede that he tore some pages out of his notebook, and I concede that he told -- which he did a lot of times.          And I concede that he told witnesses answer the question, et cetera.                 Now, is there anything else connecting him, not his company?
04-1506 +++$+++            Well, I don't understand --           No, but that's not that issue. That is, I think the question is, why is it that this statute doesn't simply provide the following route? Party A and party B enter into a settlement, and they say $10,000 is for medical and $90,000 is for pain and suffering.          You, Arkansas, are out $50,000.           Well, fine.       You're in the case anyway.               Sue the defendant for the remaining $40,000.       And that's the end of it.       Well, I have no idea about that.       I'm interested in this nest of statutes, and the question I think that I would have is why doesn't the statute propose the route for a State in your -- in your position that I just said.               If they have a good faith settlement and they think that $10,000 of this good faith settlement is attributable to the medical expense and you are out $40,000 -- $50,000, you can sue the other party.         And if you're in the case, you just proceed with the suit.       They can't settle your claim out from under you.       No, but the --       I want to go back to the Federal statutes and the State statute.       Why isn't this discussion just suggest what the answer is to the legal question raised?          The answer is, of course, you cannot get a hold of this money in the hands of the victim.                  The money in the hands of the accident victim is not your money.       It is not medical expense money.          It was stipulated that it is not.             That doesn't leave you without a remedy.        The remedy is to go against the causer of the accident and get the extra money that you think is entitled to you.            The statutes say that literally, and why not just follow them?
04-1527 +++$+++         Well, that's true, but -- so, you said it's conceded in this case?                I thought, in answer to Justice Kennedy, you said something that -- I was surprised, if it's conceded.                I thought it wasn't conceded -- tell me if I'm wrong -- that the States have water quality standards.               Those water quality standards may or may not have something to do with point source discharges.            They don't have to.       They want water to be good enough for recreation.                They want water without algae so there are more fish.               They have a lot of things.        And this statute seems to say the F- -- what used to be the FPC.               I -- is it now FERC?         Yes, okay -- used to be the Federal Power Commission -- tells them, "You have to get approval to build your dam.                And we're not going to give you approval unless you comply with State water quality standards."          This seems to me to go back into ancient history, like 1920.               And of course you have to comply.        And so, isn't the purpose of -- is there agreement that it only concerns point discharges, or does it concern water quality standards?         Really?         In other words -- discharge from a point source, what is -- well, then EPA concedes you win?            Well, fine.            So, what's --            -- the problem?     So, they're saying, as I thought was true since 1920, that you're going to get your dam only if you comply with State standards, including standards about fish, algae, junk in the water, all kinds of things that might be put there by the dam.            Right.      And they're saying, "Of course there is a discharge.                    The discharge is a discharge of water."              Okay?       The water runs into it. Now, that's enough for you to have to comply with the State standards before the F- -- FERC is going to give you a license.        Now, have you got anything - - I've heard you argue about the word "discharge"; and you say "discharge" doesn't mean "discharge of water," it means something else.            And I think that's a very logical argument.         Is there any other argument that you'd have, related to the purpose of the statute for the objective?        No, no, but it doesn't -- it doesn't say -- it says they have to comply with State water quality standards, doesn't it?            No, I thought -- it says that you have to get your permit.                     You have to be compliant with State water quality standards.                       Now, suppose a State has a nutty water quality standard. Doesn't EPA have some authority there to make sure that a water quality standard of a State, under the Clean Water Act, is -- makes sense?            In other words, if a State were to say, "Our water quality standard is the following.             We never build a dam in our State, no matter what."             Okay?   Now, there's no authority in the EPA to set that aside as it not being a proper Clean Water Act standard.            It has to be just a Clean Water Act standard.        I'm not an expert on the Clean Water Act.        Is that a proper Clean Water Act standard?        No, this decision -- I'm not asking you about this decision.                I'm asking you if a State, under the Clean Water Act, were to say, "We have the following Clean" -- now you understand what I'm --        Does EPA, or anyone else, have authority to say, "That isn't a proper Clean Water Act standard, however good you may think it is"?

04-1544 +++$+++          And we ought to take what's given as given, whatever the true meaning of ecclesiastical courts having jurisdiction over certain probate matters or not in the 18th century.        I guess what you're going to hear in 5-10 minutes --        -- you might as well deal with it now --        -- is that the inter vivos -- a -- a claim for a -- the Texas tort of interference with inter vivos gift, according to Texas law, must be brought at the time of the probate proceeding.                 And for that reason, it is bound up with probate, and for that reason, they didn't have jurisdiction.        All right.      Now, let's suppose you're --        -- suppose they're right about their interpretation.        And the strongest case for you on that is?        You said this Court has repeatedly said.        So what --        Yes, but did those documents -- did those boxes contain the key documents --        -- about the catchall trust?
04-1581 +++$+++           If -- if it's the fact that you go to the Web site and that's what's supposed to make this what it was in MCConnell which, by the way, we said was illegal, what they -- the first thing they're going to see when they get to the Web site, which I agree with you -- four times in 3 of the 12 sentences of this ad -- in 3 of the 12 -- it says, befair.org, visit befair.org, go to befair.org.                  And the first thing that they're going to see when they get to befair.org is a big headline in bold -- gold -- bold letters which says, Feingold and Kohl continue to support unprecedented filibusters of judicial nominees. So, in fact, if befair.org is brought into the picture, that makes this ad look much more like an effort to -- to defeat Senator Feingold than the ad that we considered in our previous case.          Doesn't it?          But the basic question I think is this.           All of us -- or almost all of us who are here -- spent an entire summer reading through one of the longest set of opinions I've ever seen from the lower courts and going through a record that they had compiled over months reflecting 6 years of congressional effort.             And what that record showed with dozens, hundreds I think, of examples was the basis for Congress' conclusion that there's simply no way to know whether an ad like yours is a genuine issue ad or isn't.       And the only way that we have a hope of stopping rich people or corporations or labor unions from simply trying to defeat candidates by writing sham ads is to have the rule that we had. Now, you have a very good argument, but it's an argument that I heard right in that case.                    And we considered right in that case issues like yours, just ads like yours, ads that were even less sham-like than yours, if you want to call yours a sham -- I don't mean to be pejorative.         But we considered all that, and then we used them as an example.                And of course, it was close.       5 to 4 this Court said ads that are even more apparently neutral on their face than yours, Congress can impose this requirement. Now, what's different about your ad than the ads we put right in that opinion as examples of what we'd allow Congress to control?                  What's different now or are you asking us to go back only a year later and undo what we did?          All right.        So what is the test?       Because I -- my vague recollection from a year and a half ago is that there was in that testimony political consultants who said if you really want to defeat a Senator, here's how you do it.          Run an ad that just speaks about a group of Senators.                It's plain that they're bad, and then put in some words that mention his name and everybody will get the point.                   They said that's even better than saying, vote against. And then our opinion said there is little difference between an ad that urges voters to vote against Jane Doe and one that condemns Jane Doe's record on a particular issue while exhorting viewers to call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.                    That was the opinion. So, now, what's your test to decide whether that's what's going on or whether this is a genuine issue ad?          All right.         If you can do this, can a labor union do it?          And a corporation?          All right.         Well, then -- then we're back to -- I mean, I've heard this.                       This is very familiar music to me and I think you raise a tough issue.       I just thought we perhaps had decided it. But the -- the reason that this was so tough was then these very, very wealthy individuals -- and since I once read through the list, I know who they are.      And they -- they say, I'm going to give $15 million.         You know, I'm going to give $15 million.                  So they hire this genius political consultant that's there in the record.           And what happens is ads that look an awful like this, and this consultant says, hey, we have $15 million to pay for it from this one person.                      And they run them all over the country.                       And Senator after Senator is boom, boom, boom, boom.          It becomes a question of motive and how do we know what the motive is?

04-1704 +++$+++         On the merits, I think that their claim is -- take company A and company B.                   Both are located in Toledo, both hire a certain number of people, have a certain payroll, have a certain amount of property, and have a certain amount of business. Identical.          And they're charged a tax.          And now, what -- company B, when it's thinking of building a new plant or make new investment in machinery, if it goes to Wisconsin, it will discover it pays less taxes on all those things that were already in Ohio.                  And, therefore, the people who sell land or machinery in Wisconsin are discovering it isn't being bought, because that old tax, which really had nothing to do with this new investment, is now less because of the new investment.          So, that hurts businesses in Wisconsin. As I understand it, that's their claim.          And if I've got it wrong, I'm sure you'll correct me.          All right.          Well, then I'm probably wrong. [Laughter.]          So, that -- that is true, and then the effect of that is that firms that now do business in Ohio won't build their new facility in Wisconsin, because they like the lower tax bill in Ohio.       And that hurts businesses and others in Wisconsin.           You were saying they have no harm?       I think they're pointing to that harm.           Well, what is the harm --           -- they think -- well, they can tell me.             All right.       If you have --          By the way, we're not going to do it that way, we're just going to say you pay half.          No, no.          No.     But, you see -- but my point is --          -- separate tax in Ohio, and we're going to double it, though, if your next investment is in some --          -- other State.          Correct.          Now, all we do is, we say, "We're not going to double it.                       You're going to pay the same.            But everybody invests here, pays half."
04-1739 +++$+++          So why -- let's see.        They go to the prison library what?                 Once every couple of weeks or what?           Once a week?         One -- one visit per month. And -- and how often do they go to the prison library?       It's ordered.       Yes, what it says -- that's what -- it says, to review legal materials, one at a time may be let out of his cell and is escorted to a mini law library in hand.            All right. Why couldn't you have a -- if he wants to see the newspaper in that mini law library, why couldn't there be a copy there, only the parts that are consistent with the censorship policy, just like a news of the day.       Is there a security reason or is --       Is there a security reason when he's there in leg irons looking at the books, the law books, in the mini law library?
04-373 +++$+++        It may be close to the truth.      Now, we have a case, a hypothetical.            The defendant is sitting there, the police say, "Question?"               And he says, "I want to see my lawyer."         And the policeman says the following, "That's fine, go ahead, we'll get him.            By the way, if you see him, we'll execute you.         Are you sure you don't want to talk to us?" That's plainly unlawful, isn't it?       Fine.       Now --       Now --       Now, the same thing happens, but what he says is, "You'd better talk to us, or you'll be executed.        Think about it."      Equally unlawful, right?          Okay.          Now, a minute --          -- passes while he's thinking about it.     Okay?     Is it -- is it unlawful now, because a minute has passed before he says yes?          I just --          I don't -- I don't want legalism. I just want the conclusion.             A minute has passed before he says yes.     Has that changed everything, and it becomes lawful?          No.   Now it's 15 minutes.    Now it's 30 minutes.         Okay?   Now, a court says 30 minutes is the same as one minute, "We don't think the passage of 29 extra minutes made a difference."         And what's your reply?           Not in legalism. You're going to say, "Oh, no, the passage of 30 minutes, rather than 1 minute, makes all the difference."                  And I would like to know why.      I --        Yes, that's fine.      I'm not -- I'm - - I want you to say that kind of thing.               You're saying it's not just 30 minutes, it's "also some other things happened."                 What?        So, that's --      -- possible.        That definitely cuts in your favor, unless, of course, it sounds like a good- cop/bad-cop routine.            And --          -- people --          But that's --          -- subjectively true.      And so, I'd simply wonder if the fact that it's subjectively true, and there is a finding that the defendant -- here, we have 30 minutes, and we have the fact that the other detective said, "He said he can't talk to us.               We can't do anything about it." We have that.            Is there anything else?          Yes.        Yes.       Yes.       All right.        Right.   So --        -- we have a passage --      If you're going to the standard, which is, I think, the -- actually, the difficult question here, what's wrong -- should you say -- what's wrong with saying -- which is what I was pursuing              -- that, where there is a question that's improper, as there was here, by the police, the only real question is, Is a later initiation "the fruit"?           And you say the State has to show it wasn't the fruit.          That would have the virtue of making the law quite consistent here, as it is with Fourth Amendment/Fifth Amendment cases.           That's a well known concept.           Why not?        Why -- I understand that --           -- there's a lot of language --      Is it fact, or is it not fact, law, in respect to the following?           He's sitting there.     And there is a question of what motivated him.            Did it motivate him totally that his -- this thing about his codefendant, or was he moved, in significant part -- moved, motivated -- by the earlier, 30- minute earlier, improper questioning?              That sounds like a fact. Or do you think it's not a fact?
04-433 +++$+++             I'm rather surprised at your answers because I was thinking you want to draw a rather clear line between where fraud is at issue, and only fraud.              Proximate cause, case A, the fraud does nothing but lowers the cost of the firm; case B, the fraud is something that directly is aimed to raise the cost of a particular specified competitor.                  I see a clear difference between those two cases, but you apparently don't.       No, no, it's not nebulous. It's absolutely clear.           In the one hand, you are targeting a particular defendant to raise -- a particular competitor to raise his costs.                    In the other hand, you are taking an action that simply lowers your own and, therefore, equally will hurt any competitor, whether there's one or a million.       No.     If you had my test, you'd win this case.       No, no.       I don't want to give you a win --       on a theory that --
04-473 +++$+++         Suppose that we have an instance where it is job related.                 He is not speaking as a private citizen, and it's also a public concern.                 Now, in such an instance, could we say that, at least if the matter of public concern rise to the level where it's related to an independent constitutional protection -- say, founded in the due-process clause -- under those circumstances, the employer cannot unreasonably -- though we give him an area of discretion, he cannot unreasonably retaliate.         Why not?         Why not?        And here is an independent obligation.         It's very unusual --         -- but it's there.         You'd only lose -- the Government would lose, only where you can conclude that they could -- "they," the Government -- could not -- could not reasonably conclude that he'd been insubordinate.         So, we covered the case of the Democrat, Republican, et cetera.                  In other words, we'd give him -- should we give him total discretion?              Can't we limit that discretion of the supervisor?
04-52 +++$+++          What -- what is the -- where -- where is the place in what the judge -- when did this eye-rolling take place?              I can t figure it out.       Yes, I have that in front of me.       What was the statement that the judge made in respect to which the juror is supposed to have rolled her eyes?   	 Which question?       So the reason I can t find it out is none of us know.       And it actually says it wasn t a question.         It was a statement, and that s why I can t figure it out.   	 Which was a question you said --       I see.        If you have a minute, you might -- I don t know if you -- if this is very useful. But I ve taken this point of view that -- that there s no way to get to the bottom of the use of stereotypes in cases like this, a perfect example.                  And therefore, the only thing to do, consistent with the Constitution, is no peremptories.        You have 30 seconds.       You want to say how irresponsible that is, right?
04-593 +++$+++        There are two separate arguments here, and I'm trying to separate them.                 I guess that many States have a doctrine in two areas of law.      Third party beneficiaries can sometimes recover; sometimes they can't.          Victims of efforts to interfere with a contract sometimes recover; sometimes they can't.       And one question is whether this particular individual fits within those doctrines.                  And you have to be an expert on contract law to know. But in respect to the civil rights law, I guess your position is -- and this is what I want to know -- that whatever those doctrines are, they have to be the same for white people as for black people.       Right.      So -- so it might apply. And one thing you couldn't do if you're a State is have a different rule for black people that treated them worse than white people.       All right.         And has there ever been a case in respect, whether it's affirmative action or some other thing, that interprets that -- that -- this particular civil rights statute to say that for whatever historical reasons, et cetera, black people are entitled to more protection under contract law than white?       So how do we deal with this? That is to say, do I have to become an expert on contract law, or do I say to the Ninth Circuit or the circuit, look, the -- the question here is not what the contract law is except insofar as it's relevant to whether there's a differential in treatment?         Well, but that's exactly what I'm asking.          If -- if you win, this case is reversed, sent back.           I mean, what do -- would I tell them?       And why not tell them, instead of having to delve into this, is, look, it's plausible here that third party beneficiary doctrine might cover this person?        It's also plausible not.            We're not experts. We don't know.           You figure out what the normal rule is and apply that normal rule.         Well, what about the other part of it, which is the -- the interference with the contract?         Could we say the same thing there?           We send it back, say, look, we're not experts on this, it's a matter of State law typically, and be absolutely sure, please, that whatever doctrine you normally apply is applied to this case too because it's plausible.                  He's the sole shareholder.            He's the sole beneficiary.
04-597 +++$+++ 
04-607 +++$+++            I guess that --          But you told the -- you said, judge, if you in fact hold that this claim 13 satisfies section 112 and is sufficiently precise and specific and concise, if you hold that, then the claim would violate Morse?          And you argued that specifically?            And so your problem -- I guess that you said that.      I mean, you quote it in your supplementary brief on page 6.          And it's the language.          That's what it said.     It didn't say Morse.           It said Diehr.          Dier incorporates Morse.          As was my understanding.          So your complaint about the paragraph on 17a is that it did not deal with that argument.          But I imagine they'll say that simply mentioning it in an oral argument is not enough to get us to think seriously about it.        I didn't understand the definiteness doctrine.           I mean, all these things in 1854 I guess weren't so clear.            But I think the precise claim in Samuel Morse's case was the use of the motive power of the electric current for making or printing intelligible characters.          That sounds absolutely definite.       Anyone can understand it. I thought the problem there was that although anyone can understand it, you can't claim something as broad as that.        You must intend to claim something narrower.            And insofar as it's narrower, it isn't precise.               So insofar as it's broad, it's too broad, but definite.                And insofar as it's narrow, it's not there, but indefinite.                Okay? Precisely the claim that they raised before the Federal Circuit and precisely the claim -- with appropriate citations, and precisely the claim in respect to which the Federal Circuit said nothing.       Yes.     And we here apply the correlation to any homocysteine test, any one here, any one in the future, any one that any mind might impend.               What's the difference?       I apply electricity to all methods of putting down letters with electricity.               I apply the correlation to all methods of creating a homocysteine test.       Oh, no, I'm not talking about going beyond it.         I just thought that line between definiteness and 101, 112, 101 is not quite so clear as I would have thought, because it sounds to me relying on the 1854 case of Samuel F. B. Morse, they're making the same kind of argument and, indeed, you translated Morse as a definiteness 112 argument, and yet it seemed to me that's the kind of argument they're making.
04-623 +++$+++            In your view, were it not for the statute, the Federal statute, your view of the Attorney General's authority is -- leaving that statute aside, if it weren't there -- the Attorney General, should we have an Attorney General who is opposed to the death penalty, could, in fact, regulate or stop Federal -- State death penalties, through this same mechanism, by saying that no physician can be registered insofar as he engages in that.       Well, what we're getting -- at least what I'm getting at was this is, I would probably have read the statute to say that the drug statute, which is trying to stop drug addiction and heroin and -- has nothing to do with the death penalty.                  And I would think that the argument on the other side is that the statute has nothing to do with assisted suicide.                  Congress didn't think about the death penalty, and it didn't think about assisted suicide.         It's rather like the tobacco case, except a fortiori.         Now, what's your response to that?       Why were -- you were going to say, at one point -- why was Congress concerned about overdoses of narcotics and so forth?                   Why?       But, I mean, there was a reason, wasn't there, that they're worried about people taking narcotics?       Right.       Right.      What was the main --       I would have thought it was narcotics addiction.       All right.        Well, if it is narcotics addiction --       -- and I would have thought that was it --         Not solely.        You go ahead. What else?         Right.         Yes.     Yes, but it's true addiction.          And this seems to --         No?
04-631 +++$+++        Then that's the problem, right there, because I thought -- first, there is a tax -- you get a credit if you don't sell the fuel to anybody.                    So, I don't think it's quite -- if you just sit there with --       Maybe not --       You don't?        All right.       You'd still have to pay tax.       Okay.       Now, on --       All right.       Yes.       All right.       Fine.       You are Kansas.        You sell -- the retailer in Kansas sells it to Nebraska.                  Nebraska is, in a sense, a foreign and independent State.                  And I guess, at some level, the tribes are arguing, "Well, you sell to us, our local retailer.            We, too, are a foreign and independent State, even more so.                So, if you're going to treat them this way -- give the people in Nebraska a credit so they don't have to pay -- why don't you treat us that way?          We drive on Kansas roads sometimes.           So do the Nebraskans" --        -- -- "sometimes."        So, they say -- get into interest balancing.        Now, what -- now you have the whole argument that I'm thinking of.                    What do you respond?
04-698 +++$+++         That's a well-established principle of administrative law.                I've never seen a case in administrative law where a party -- a private party coming in and challenging a Government's action doesn't bear the burden of proof.             And Alaska isn't contrary to that.       Alaska, they were citing hornbook law, whether -- what happens with the -- if EPA normally does have a burden of proof when it challenges a State action, and that doesn't change, whether they bring it in a State proceeding or whether it's in a Federal proceeding.                      I didn't think it was quite on point.                  But maybe you know that I'm wrong on this.            And so --        -- is there a -- can you think of any instance, in all of administrative law, where you didn't start out with the idea that a person challenging a -- an agency action that's been taken, and so forth, doesn't have the burden of proof?        That's what I --        I do think that, yes.        There isn't?        -- I thought that their -- that judges normally did their job, which is, you look at complicated evidence, and you say, "This side is a little bit better, or that side is a little bit better."                  Has this come up in -- a lot, where they say, in this area, "Oh, it's exactly" --           -- "in equipoise"?              This is true.            All right, that's true.      That's -- I understand.              I sympathize with that point.         I'm worried, however, about the fact that this statute doesn't just cover the initial IEP.                  It covers a whole range of things, including, for example, you have a hyperactive child.       The hyperactive child behaves badly in class.                  The hyperactive child receives discipline related, say, to how it's placed.              Well, the parents might -- properly, perhaps -- think that was very unfair and wrong, and they might challenge that disciplinary mark.                    There can be thousands of different kinds of issues that come up.                     And, in all of these issues, is it supposed to be the burden of the school board, for example, to show that the teacher who had the child sit in the back of the class or received a bad discipline mark or something?                    Does the -- does the school board have to prove that the teacher was right?            Wouldn't it, if it were related to the placement?        No, no, I say that there are a number of -- what I'm thinking of is a lot of interim decisions that come up that are affecting how the child is placed -- whether in class, whether in that class, whether with a special teacher, whether without a special teacher, whether with somebody during the recess periods, whether not.      I mean, they're -- these are very complicated matters, and there can be important overall matters, and there can be what I'd call interstitial matters.        What I'm driving at is -- and I think it was well expressed in one of these cases, a New Jersey case, perhaps -- that is it the same burden of proof whether the matter is interstitial or whether it's an initial placement or a change of --        -- placement?   Do we have the same burden of proof always on the school board, no matter what?
04-712 +++$+++         But I guess what he's saying -- I'm trying to put the -- as good a light on it as I can -- it's a -- that if, in fact -- if a big real-estate developer, which is a corporation -- what they do is, they organize a lot of deals, and their deals would take the form of hundreds and hundreds of limited partnerships, which are owned buildings in various States.               And I think he's saying, "Well, for diversity purposes, we should consider the citizenship of the parent corporation to be the citizenship of the limited partnership that happens to have control of the building that we're complaining about."        No, he thinks --        -- you are responsible, but he thinks you ought to have the citizenship of the intermediate entities that own, or manage directly, the building.
04-721 +++$+++           I don't know how this came about.        I mean -- I mean, I'm asking both sides the same question.            It'll sound very favorable to you, but if you answer it just yes, because it's favorable to you, I might learn, later, I was wrong, and you won't have had a chance to answer.                 So, I want your honest opinion on this.           I don't know how this happened.          And I don't know -- did you ask for en banc?          No.     I don't know how the California Court could have read the opinion -- which, of course, I wrote for the Court, so maybe I am reading things into it that weren't there -- but I don't know how any judge could read that opinion we wrote and come to this conclusion.           I thought that it said, you know, on -- that there are three issues -- what's the word "pending"?          Does the word "pending" apply to the time period between when the lower court decides a case and you appeal?           That's typically 20 days or 30 days.         Are those 20 days or 30 days counted in the tolling period?                 I thought part one clearly said the answer is yes.                 Then we looked at California, and they don't have the words "20 days" or "30 days."          They say "reasonable time."             And then we said, "Still applies, because 'reasonable time' is probably 20 or 30 days."              They don't have a radically different rule; it's a similar rule.                     Then we come to part three, and it says, "This is 45 days."                     There's -- no 4 and a half months, wasn't it?         This isn't just 20 or 30 days.         So, is it timely?         And, there, I thought the Court said -- I mean, I was reading it -- say, "Well, it's hard to say, because there might have been excuses for the delay."           What about the words that were written there, "on the merits"?         On --         But that had nothing to --         -- do with the case.      The lack of diligence had nothing to do with this aspect of the case.          But, what about the words "on the merits"? And there, what I think the court wrote is that the fact that it says "on the merits" doesn't prove it -- what -- it doesn't prove that it was timely.                  Why?    And then I listed a bunch of reasons.                  There are reasons. Sometimes courts say "on the merits," even though it's delayed.         All right?    They say "on the merits."         Or because they want to tell the prisoner or -- there are a lot of reasons why, all of which are listed.                  So, we send it back to see whether this 4-and-a-half-month delay, given the excuses, was still timely.                  We -- all right?       Now --       -- we now get a case where it's 3 years.       And the court says, "It's timely, because they used the word 'on the merits.'" But I thought -- I said, in the opinion, I thought the court adopted that the words "on the merits" do not decide the matter.       Now, what do you --       -- do in those circumstances?       No, but did --       -- you ask for rehearing en banc?       Because any judge, including me, can make a mistake.         What did you do?       And you didn't ask for a hearing en banc.       Well, why, when you --       -- get a fair -- because any judge can make a mistake --       -- why don't you just go and ask the Ninth Circuit to say, "Look, this is not -- read the opinion, read what they said.                 Correct it."         It's worse.         You're representing the attorney general of California, and you have a lot of litigation in the Ninth Circuit.                  It's -- I mean, the other side's going to answer on the merits, if they can.      And they're in an awkward position here, I understand.           But I need to know what to -- what do you think we should do?           I mean, here, we write an opinion, and they --       -- it seems to perhaps, inadvertently or not -- and the reason I turn to you is, judges are busy, they have huge dockets --       And, often, unless it's very clearly pointed out by the lawyers, or the lawyers take action, you get -- waste everybody's time and money.       So, in other words, he delays, after he gets the library access, for an extra year.       Now, is there any excuse they're making for that?            Because if you don't tell me, they're --       -- going to tell me.       Yes.         It would?         I thought --         -- that was --         -- an open --         -- question, frankly.         I mean, I can't imagine California would do this, but I guess if California did say that, "The period of time between the time you lost in the District Court and the time you filed, in every other State, is 30 days, but, in California, it's a reasonable time.                    And what we mean by a 'reasonable time' is 3 years, without any excuses" -- I guess, then, maybe the dissent in Carey v. Saffold would have been right in respect to that.         It would have said that that isn't pending under Federal law, whether California says it or not.           So, the role of the Federal law versus the State law, I thought we left open.          But you can't --          -- defer to something --          -- under this statute, where Congress wrote the word "pending."                      And I wouldn't have thought they did have in mind a --          -- State that says, "It's pending, even though you have no excuse and didn't file anything for 3 years, your appeal."                       Now, I haven't heard that fully briefed and so forth, so I hesitate to express a final conclusion on it.                   But it --          -- since it's never going to come up, I don't think, I don't know I have to have a final conclusion.            All right --            -- that's a --            -- that's --            How many cases are there on habeas in California every year, about?            No, I mean about.        Just give me the rough ballpark.            All right.        So, the -- in the Supreme Court.            So, there are 25- -- so there are several thousand cases every year.            All right.        Thousands.            Okay.      So, I don't know what I'm doing with California procedure when I pass a -- pass a law, is what it would be.                     Write a rule, write a presumption.              I have no idea what I'm doing there. They've worked out a system.                   But I don't -- why doesn't it work just to say to the lower courts, "Do your job"?          What we said -- and maybe it wasn't expressed clearly -- maybe -- "Courts, look, it says 'reasonable time.'         All right?         Now, reasonable time, in every other State is 30 days, sometimes 20 days."        "Sometimes the most, 60 days.       So, look and see if it was filed within a reasonable time.          That's all.       And if California passes -- some specific thing says something special about it, of course, pay attention to that."                  What's wrong with that?       They just would do it like they do any other thing of deciding what happens in --        Yes, that is the problem.          Well, 180 days from what?            Well, I mean, you file --            -- the reply brief in the lower court.              Maybe the judge will take 4 months to decide it.          What's the relation?             I don't understand that.       Or maybe it'll take --            -- 2 days --            -- to decide.            Why?     What would the theory be?      I don't understand that.            So, a judge -- you file it. On day -- what -- you file it on April 1st, and then the judge decides it in August.                    Or September.    And now it's only 3 days before the 6-months -- you have to file your appeal, like, in 3 days.                      That wouldn't make sense.        And the converse would not --         You can't --         -- file an --         -- appeal before -- oh, maybe you can in California.              You're going to file the appeal before the lower court decides it?         Even -- or even before they get a lower court decision.       They don't, at all.       In other --       -- they don't, at all.          Oh.       How often --       Do you, as the Attorney General, what period of time after the District Courts made a decision, and now -- they've now filed their claim in the Court of Appeals -- how long is it before you say it's untimely?
04-759 +++$+++ 
04-805 +++$+++           Well, it would depend. That's why -- really it's a question for Mr. Alioto, but I want to know chapter and verse citations. Pan Am and Grace meet before they set up Panagra.         Of course, they talk about price.            But what do they say?           Suppose what they say is you, Panagra, have the power to set price.                Normal.     You, Panagra, have the power to set price but never below $14 a ticket.        That wouldn't be normal.             What are they trying to do there?           They're trying to protect Grace. So I think a lot would depend on what they said in the preliminary meeting, and of course, what I want to know is this is a summary judgment motion where, as the other side pointed to particular conversations that they made which would say it's more like the second than the first.          It may be, but still at some point they discussed it and I would like to know what they said.        I mean, that's a surprising concession to me.         We -- we found a -- a joint marketing company.         All right?        And the whole point of this is to set single prices.               And you're saying when they -- and the venture, let's say, is approved by the FTC, the joint selling agency.               The purpose of it is to set a single price to sell in France or something.        And you're saying now we're going to go look at their prices that they set and decide if they're reasonable?        Maybe there is.          That's exactly right.          I would have thought there's no competition because there are not two independent decision-makers.          It has nothing to do with the prices that end up.          Maybe you could explain to me how this did work.             The -- the -- my understanding, which might be not correct, is we have some facilities that refine gasoline and there are some people who take the gasoline that is refined and they sell it to gas stations.         Now, those facilities and those people now work for one hierarchy of officials called Equilon.                   Is that right?        All right.      So somebody has to say what price it's being sold at.                 Equilon's gas. Who decides it?        All right.      What is it?        No.    I imagine there are some human beings in Equilon called marketers, and those human beings in Equilon who work for Equilon would say Equilon will sell the refined gasoline to gas stations at such-and-such prices.                 That's normally how a company works.         Is there something different about this?        What is their view of it?        The Texaco product being a product that comes out of refineries that previously belonged to Texaco or the Texaco product being gasoline that comes out of either refinery but is sold to stations labeled Texaco, or both?                 Which?        All right.        I could see how that could be a violation because it's possible that Equilon, if left on its own, would decide that its best marketing strategy was sometimes to set a differential. But now they can't do that because the two parents have agreed that they can't.        Is that what happened?        That would be rather like Pan American and Grace saying that, Panagra, charge whatever price you want, but above all, don't go below $50 because remember, we, Grace, have some ships out there and we want people to take the ships.        -- I take it that their point was, what you sort of said there, that -- that they had agreed -- sorry.             Forget it. (Laughter.)
04-848 +++$+++             -- I guess I couldn't sue.              And I sue -- I sue for public humiliation.              See?   I mean, what about that one? [Laughter.]              I mean, what I -- to sort of my cards on the -- I was thinking, "Well, that comes close," but maybe it -- maybe it is within the -- within the -- within the exception.                 I'm not sure.           And then --              -- I think --              -- on the other --       On the other -- no, they -- see, it -- he put it on the porch, which is transmitting it, in such a way that it fell open.                   But I'm just trying to think -- and then the -- on the other side of it, you have the automobile accident.              And I guess he comes along the street, the postman, swinging my package around, and bops someone on the head with it.                I guess that's covered. And then, this case is somewhere in the middle.       But what's the principle according to which we're drawing it?       But the --        Well, ordinary tort doesn't quite work, because I guess my public humiliation case is -- could be an ordinary tort.               Somebody could go up to the porch and rip it open, nothing to do with the mail.                     And, moreover, somebody could, in fact, delay the transmission of my inheritance.         See?     They could.         So, all those things could be ordinary torts.        Doesn't it have a -- in good condition.          Therefore, when they put it -- therefore, I guess, ripping it open is, in fact, not in good condition, so maybe that is immune.            And leaving it on the porch in a position where somebody would trip over it, you might say they didn't deliver it in good condition, because what they're supposed to do is place it somewhere where you don't trip over it.          And that's good condition for the delivery.
04-881 +++$+++        It didn't contain the bar at the time that they said, "You can collect it."               In the later statute, which said, "You now can collect out of Social Security," when they passed that, did it contain a 10-year bar?       I thought the Higher Education Act said -- as of what year did the Higher Education Act say, "No statute of limitations applies to us"?       Fine.     In --         -- 1991, it said, "No statute of limitations applies to us."                Then, in what year did the statute -- was passed which said, "And you can collect money out of Social Security payments for higher education"?         All right.        Why isn't that the end of it?          So --         -- so there was no -- there was no statute of limitations applying to the Social Security Act; and then, in 1996, they say, "And now go get them."         What can we do about that?         What did they say?         It has a 10-year bar.        But the earlier 1991 Act says, "That doesn't apply to us."            So, in other words, you're saying that that provision of the later statute that says, "Go get them on Social Security," implicitly reads into it the 10-year bar that's in a different part of the statute.            So, it's as if it said, "Go get them on Social Security, under 407, which is gone now, but only for 10 years."       Is that what your -- I'm trying to understand this.       Yes.       Okay.        The only problem is, it doesn't say that.       All right, but that's --        You can call it any purpose you want, but there is an earlier word in 9- -- 1091(a), just what Justice Kennedy said.             The earlier word says limitations don't apply to the higher-education debt.                     And so, if this later statute, the words you're talking about, the words of "10 years," the words that limit when you can do it, if those words, which are in subsection (e), are a "limitation," then I guess the earlier statute says they don't apply to the higher-education debt.                  And so, I don't see how you get out of that.               I mean -- I mean, this is a rather harsh result.            I understand why you'd like to get out of it.          But I don't understand how we do get out of it.       No, it -- I mean, you -- it's -- it probably comes up a lot.              You have -- you have the earlier act that imposes -- suppose you have some -- Endangered Species Act and -- at an earlier time -- and it says all provisions of a certain kind will have this effect in respect to endangered species.                    And then you have some laters act -- later acts.                    And, in those later acts, there are certain things about how to treat certain animals and so forth.           And the question would be, "Well, does that earlier thing, telling you how to treat an endangered species, apply now to the animals in this later act insofar as they're endangered?"                    And the answer would be, "Of course it does" --       -- unless there's some special reason --       -- for thinking that it doesn't. 	 And so, what's the special reason --       -- here?          You have an earlier act that says, when you see those words, "10-year limitations," forget them where student loans in effect. Now we have a later act, and it has the word "10-year limitations," and you're giving some reasons why --       -- it is special and --       -- so forth.          And --       -- I don't know --       -- if they're --       -- strong enough --       Uh-huh.       Yes, that is the nub.       But, I mean, they don't have that big burden to show.            They have to just --       -- show it's normal.       And you have to show it's special.
04-885 +++$+++           Tell me, if you're -- if you're right -- let's suppose you're right.                  I'm over here.     That's -- [Laughter.]          That's all right.     So, it's hard to figure out, because the direction -- you can't tell by the sound.      I don't know if there's a modern system that would help with that, but -- you're right. Suppose that the State -- suppose you're right. What I'd worry about -- and I'd like your response to this -- is that in bankruptcies, or weak firms -- a lot of firms are weak, and they owe a lot of money to the States.                  So, the States figure this out after a while.                 It takes a few years to seep through, but once they see what they can do, they say, "Here's what we'll do.            Settle your claims against the State, which happen to be pretty good, for 50 cents on the dollar.                     Give us the money.        And you're -- we're out of it."            So, they settle it. A month later, bankrupt. Now, two things have happened.            The States got 50 cents on the dollar, every other creditor gets 5 cents on the dollar, because they were a month ahead of it.                  The second thing that happened is, the creditor -- the firm lost the chance to come in and be rehabilitated.               So, the result of this is two bad things: bankruptcy's law's basic purpose, to treat creditors fairly, bankruptcy law's basic purpose, to give firms a chance to rehabilitate, are both seriously undermined.               So, given the Bankruptcy Clause in the Constitution, how is it possible to say that Congress does not have the power to prevent those two very, very seriously harmful results -- harmful in terms of the basic purpose of the Bankruptcy Clause?         But there is not a Tort Clause of the United States Constitution.               There is not a Contract Clause. And there is a Bankruptcy Clause.
04-8990 +++$+++            What did it rest on?       What -- what is the district court's conclusion?                    The court concludes that the spillage occurred after the FBI crime lab received and tested the evidence.                    What does that rest on?        Any reasonable juror would have had to have a reasonable doubt.        All right.      And you're saying yes, any reasonable juror would have had to have a reasonable doubt irrespective of what the trial judge found.        You've mentioned -- in response to Justice Ginsburg, you didn't mention -- and perhaps it was inadvertent.               If not, I want to know why not.      I thought if you get through the gate, what you're going to say is the State should have given us evidence that they had that showed that Mr. Muncey had sexual relations with his wife the morning of the killing, and therefore, the semen that they found didn't necessarily belong to your client, but rather belonged to him.        As it turned out, it didn't.        So you're going to make that Brady claim.        Any reasonable juror would have to have a reasonable doubt.
04-905 +++$+++        So, you go back to the language -- are you finished with that answer?              Go ahead and finish, if you want.       All right.       In respect to the language, how do you read it?         I think it's ambiguous.        "To discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities."              Do you read it -- "different purchaser" -- "to discriminate in price in respect to that commodity that is purchased"?              Do you read it "to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities -- i.e., the commodity, the particular item -- the commodity there refers to the particular item in respect to which there is the discrimination"?              How do you want to read it, literally?        I just want your --       -- literal reading of the statute to -- I agree with you, 60 years, nobody's questioned it.                 I agree with you, policy reasons, very strongly on your side.                   I agree with you, at least hypothetically, but for the particular language.        So, look at the phrase and read the language as you want me to read it.      You're giving --      -- me a policy argument.         I don't want a policy argument, for the moment.                 I want to know -- what you're saying is that the word "purchaser" means "purchaser in respect to the particular commodity -- this one that is purchased, there has to be a discrimination in price."      And what you're hearing, I think, is, well, this person, the dealer, bought other items in respect to which there was no discrimination in price.                 So, he is a purchaser of that commodity.          You see, "commodity" could refer to the kind of thing -- Volvo trucks -- or it could refer to the particular thing -- this truck.            And I want to know how you read the literal language.      That's all I want --      -- the textual answer.           Oh, no, no.        I'm very --           -- sorry.      The effect of such competition --           -- was conceded in this case, that there's the effect on the competition.                   There are two separate things.      There is the truck that was purchased by the disfavored dealer.      In respect to that, he wasn't hurt, in the sense of the statute, because, even though he got a lower profit margin, that doesn't count.             I'm not focusing on that. I am focusing upon the truck that he did not purchase.        The reason that the disfavored dealer did not purchase that truck is that he had a rival -- maybe there's only one case of it, but there's at least one -- he had a rival, the favored dealer, who got the purchase.                   He got the order from the customer, and then ordered the truck.                   Now, in that one, I take it, the problem is that there was no purchase by the disfavored dealer.           All right.         But what you're hearing is, "So what?             He was a dealer whose line of business was to purchase Volvo trucks, and, therefore, he is a purchaser of a commodity -- namely, Volvo trucks."        And there was a discrimination -- namely, the offer was discriminatory.                And there was a harm to competition, in the -- in the Robinson-Patman sense -- his rival got the sale.        So, I want the textual answer.        Yes.        The effect of such discrimination is that his next-door rival, in effect, "got the sale."                  Do you want to say that isn't enough?        Let's assume I don't agree with you about that.         Now --        -- what?       Fine.     That's --       You've put your finger right on it. My question is so obvious that you're not giving me an answer. Every case for 60 years has been on your side of it.                  Those judges, though, were -- must have been reading some language. And how did they interpret that language?                  That's all I'm asking you.     A very literal question.           It has nothing to do with policy or anything.         And all I want you to do is take the statute and read the language so that it is possible for you to win this case.       Okay.       Why not?       Why not?      The -- Hiland -- is that the one?      Hiland Dairy?      In other words, a -- I mean, you could go in -- I see that.          But what -- is there any authority for that, that just one -- a head-to-head competition, he bought the truck.        Let's -- keep that out of it, so imagine they bought the truck, they resold it, and the market structure is such there probably is quite a lot of competition, in fact, with other dealers, and they lost at least one sale.                That's not enough to prove an injury to competition?       What's the authority for that?       That's a different matter. That's a -- what -- I'm saying, What authority is there -- have there been cases in which that was not viewed?                 After all, let's suppose the dealers are located geographically in about the same place, and it's logical to think they'd go for the same customers.        They overlap.     Their territories are close.         Logical to think people shop around for trucks.                 And we have in the record one item where they -- one instance in which they found the customer, and he said, "Yeah, I did -- I did go and shop in both.     I lost" -- the disfavored dealer lost the sale.      Any authority?      Well, they say, "This is our evidence that it is likely."          Just what I said.
04-928 +++$+++           Can you --          Can you --       Well, can't you under -- look, first imagine that they don't want to introduce one word from the mother's mouth that isn't already in that transcript.         Imagine that's the circumstance.          If that's the circumstance, then I should think there is no doubt, under Oregon law, that those words in the transcript are admissible.             And I believe that under Oregon law -- and I'm not certain -- that, an ordinary case, a death-eligible person does have the right to argue in the sentencing proceeding.                    Think back over that trial jury and you will see that there are doubts as to whether this man is guilty or not.                    Am I right -- am I right on the first part?              Am I right on the second part?       All right.          In other words, prior to this case, in the State of Oregon, where there was a death case -- maybe there weren't very many, but where there was one, under Oregon law -- we have the trial; immediately thereafter, the sentencing, and the lawyer had no right to argue, under Oregon law.                    Think back about your certainty as to whether this individual is guilty.       Yes, all right.        And did the court say, here -- the Oregon court, in this case -- one, You can introduce evidence, which it seems to have been mistaken about, about not being there, but that, second, the Federal Constitution gives you the right to argue the residual doubt?        Ah.      "Consider the evidence" is different from "making an argument about the evidence."          And what I didn't see in the -- Oregon's majority opinion, is a statement that not only can this evidence be introduced -- because, after all, in a normal case, the jury's heard it --        It's the same jury.     But I didn't see, anywhere, where they addressed the question about what kind of argument the defense had the right to make at the sentencing trial in respect to the residual doubt that they might have from what they just heard.       Can you point, in that opinion, to where they made that statement that you just said they made about the argument?        Well, that isn't the thrust of my question, of course.              The thrust of my question is that if, in fact, this evidence from the mother comes in under State law, it comes in under State law, because -- I have the cite; you know the --       -- section I'm referring to. If it comes in under State law, and they're not trying to prove anything else, and the holding of the Oregon Supreme Court is about what evidence is admissible, and not about what arguments to be made, I don't see what reason we would have to reach an issue that isn't in the case.           Well, why is --           What about Oregon revised stat 163.150?            It says, "In a capital sentencing proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that all evidence previously offered and received may be considered for purposes of the sentencing hearing." Now, that's Oregon law.               It's long been there.   What possible reason could Oregon have for having that provision, which is, "Jury, you shall consider all the evidence you just heard at the guilt phase of the trial"?        What reason could that be?               How is it supposed to be relevant, "all evidence," unless it's relevant to the question of whether there is doubt?        But that's a different provision.          I'm now thinking of the "normal case," where you hear the guilt phase, and now we're in the sentencing phase, and it says here, under Oregon law, "Judge, tell the jury that everything they previously heard at the guilt phase they may consider for purposes of what sentence they should impose."                     I just wonder what that sentence is doing there in Oregon law, unless the jury is supposed to think about whether this guy's really -- "I'm completely certain he's guilty."         Is the 2 in the original trial, or not?         Yes.
04-944 +++$+++ 
04-9728 +++$+++           Why --          Why, if we're going to catch some additional people, is that not sufficient?                  That is, why is it unreasonable, say, not for law professors, but business school professors, management consultants, to say, "You have a lot of prisoners in California, hundreds of thousands -- I don't know, maybe more than 100,000 -- and we'll tell the Legislature that they can cut the terms, save money, release them early, but we want to have management checks.        And the management checks are, you might be searched at any time.             And we catch a few.        And that's helpful."         Now, if the --          -- State decides that, what's unreasonable about it?                 "They're" --          -- "letting the people out earlier than they otherwise would" --          -- says the Legislature.          And what's on the other side?       The other side --          -- is, you'd rather not have policemen search you, but your alternative is going to be in jail.          But, of course, that's how it happens when he's in prison.          But the reason ---          -- the reason that people, I think, are saying that is because they have a lot of prisoners, they're trying to create a category of people who don't have to stay in prison, where they have no rights.          And the real question is, can California, in trying to create this interim category, reduce the Fourth Amendment right in the way you describe?          Of course they can't do it, but the justification is not that there is something bad about this particular individual or he's in some kind of limbo.           The reason is that there's a policy tending towards release, which California has decided they want to introduce this as a condition.                  Now --          -- and so, what -- and the question is, what's unreasonable about that?
04-980 +++$+++             See, I'm not -- this is a fairly complex area.            And, as I understand, at this moment -- and I hope you'll correct me if I'm wrong -- in a "weighing" State, we look at the aggravating side, and there seem, let's say, to be three factors that you could take into account and weigh them against all the mitigation.           I'm imagining that.        And you might have thought, if factor one turns out to be invalid, the reason that that's a big mistake, because the jury would have weighed something against all that mitigating evidence that it shouldn't have.             And what's something?      There would be a lot of evidence on it, so it took it -- evidence into account it shouldn't have.                 So, I might have thought that was so. But when I read the cases, that isn't so, because I think it's -- in Clemons the evidence would have come in anyway.           So, if that isn't so, what could be wrong with this problem in the "weighing" State?                 And the answer, I guess, has to be that the prosecutor or the State said, "Jury, you look to these three things," with a tone of voice that really made them important.                 And the jury then weighed one and two and three.                 It didn't have anything to do with the evidence. Well, if that's the problem, California seems to have that problem, because one of the things it says to weigh is, "Weigh circumstances of the crime."                 And that means that's not everything.                That's not the history of this defendant. And so, the problem that existed in Clemons and in Stringer and in Zant that led to constitutional error seems to be there in California's case, too. Now, I probably have made five mistakes in my little recitation here, and I'd ask you to point them out. [Laughter.]
05-1056 +++$+++              Copyright.       Copyright.   You normally copyright.             I take it that we are operating under the assumption that software is patentable?    We have never held that in this Court, have we?             So what should we do here? Should, if we are writing this, since it's never been held that it's patentable in this Court --             If I were writing something, should I say on the assumption that it's patentable?    Since the issue isn't raised?             His answer to me is that -- that -- it's sort of misleading to think of this as if it's just information, because it's really a method that switches things at a level of detail that is impossible to put in a patent application.              It's taking the information in a patent application, it's transforming it into what we think of as 1's and 0's, but they're not really even 1's and 0's. What they are is things that happen with electricity.             And it's putting that on the disk and then it makes other things happen.               It's putting something physical on a disk, pits and lands, instructions that are copied from the master disk and then put into either a hard drive or a disk, it's the same thing.              It's something that is into the computer that will make the computer operate. You're right, Justice Ginsburg, that the court of appeals for the Federal Circuit thought it was bringing this statute up to date and it even said so. We are making an extension of the statute to keep up to date with the technology.           That is not for courts to do. This Court is --               So they had a license to do that, because if they didn't have a license to make the master disk here in the United States, the making of it would have violated the patent; is that right?
05-1074 +++$+++              Suppose you go back to the 15 year old action which led to disparity that continues up to today, and suppose at the beginning or in July of 2006 the woman discovers it and brings her claim and suppose she wins.             Now, is it the case -- and here I'm uncertain.         I thought there was some rule in respect to getting damages that you could only go back 2 years?            And in that case would it mean that in this case where it happened 15 years ago and she won, but she didn't bring her act until August of 2006, that she could only then collect the extra money for the preceding 2 years?            So it isn't going to open up tremendous liability for 15 or 20 years ago.
05-1120 +++$+++              What is your answer to Justice Scalia?   Because I thought you said before that you thought it was appropriate for us to send this case back so that they could redetermine in light of proper considerations whether they wanted to exercise their authority.             Am I wrong about that?
05-1126 +++$+++            But you do have a case -- anywhere, forget antitrust.              Suppose it's a tort case, and the following complaint is filed.                   My foot hurts.   I've gone to Dr. Smith for 15 years.                  I claim he is negligent.    Is that valid?           All right.          Now, if you think that's valid, I understand that you think this complaint does just what I said in the field of antitrust.    But is there any case that you've come across which would say a complaint just as I have described it --           Either is valid or is not valid.   You'd like to find one that says it's not valid, so what's your best effort in any field of law.             You can get into trouble by alleging too much, I guess, because if you allege a lot, you might leave something out.                    And you say, well, what about that one.           But suppose we keep it very, very minimal.      And a person just says, I'm hurt and the defendant, I claim, negligently injured me. Period.   Period.             Well, why not?             So the only thing that's missing there are some facts.             All right.          So now you're saying a complaint has to have facts?           Now you're, that's the part precisely which you're following that I don't, that I actually don't know, is the extent to which you have to put in a complaint, in whatever field of law, you can allege a fact.              You say the person ran over me --           Or you say, they treated me negligently.    That's a fact.             That means something happened there.    But suppose you write the complaint and there is just no notion that you have a what and when, how, under what circumstances.                     It's just totally out of thin air, and the defendant doesn't know what, what period of time he is supposed to be thinking about, what, what happens to such a complaint?    There must be some law on it in torts or someplace?             Well, why couldn't you do the same?             Oh, but they're -- they're using the fact that there was parallel behavior as a basis for thinking there was more than parallel behavior.      They are using it as a basis for thinking that once, on some occasion that's relevant, there were people meeting in a room and saying things to each other.    So they are not just saying that it's sufficient.    They are saying it's evidence that something else occurred.            Can they say on the 14th of January, 2004, we believe that in the city of New York, they agreed upon this course of action?               That would surely be sufficient?           Well, it's saying, all I've done is limited it in time and space.               Just as you might say on October the 24th, 2004 at the corner of 14th and Third Avenue, defendant drove negligently and injured me.    That's certainly a complaint, isn't it?           Isn't it?           Well, look, the one I just alleged in the tort law is a complaint.                I've just copied it out of the model complaints.           Am I right or not?           Well, I understand the standard.           I want to know how to apply the standard and now I take my tort case --           -- which is okay, and now I say sometime during the last 10 years he drove negligently and injured me.             Is that no good?           And so you're saying that this case is like that, when because they don't say when they met, they don't say what happened, they don't give a time or place. If that's, leaving your side parallelism out of it, I'm past you on that, all right?                I'll accept for argument's sake all your point about that. Now if you're saying this is too vague, leaving that out of it, because it doesn't say time and place of the meetings or give any other clue for meetings etcetera, what's your best authority ? This is an area of law I'm not familiar with.   I'm looking for cases that will tell me how specific a complaint has to be to tie the events down to specific ones.             Dura is still the best. I think I, did I write that case? (Laughter.)             In fact I'd like something in tort law or something that, you know, that I get a general idea of what the law is because I don't know that antitrust is --
05-11284 +++$+++ 
05-11304 +++$+++            What you're going to hear in a second, I'm sure, because I read it in the briefs, my understanding of the Texas point is slightly different.     It is this.            That under Texas law, when you file before the, before the trial, a general objection, unless you make the objection again when the specific, when a specific instruction is given, you've forfeited your rights to appeal. Under Texas law. And they say that's true of evidence and that's true here, too.       And they say that's just Texas law, ordinary Texas law.              Now --           That's what you did, you didn't make the right objection.               Now you come up here and well, you are out.             You can't make any argument.   But -- we are very generous, and we will let even people who make every wrong procedural thing still have a shot, if what they have, if what they are pointing to absolutely egregious.                    But your isn't absolutely egregious so you're in the same boat as if you just didn't have any argument because you didn't follow the Texas law.       Now, I take it, that's their point.   What's your response?             Oh, you're there in a Texas court.   We're not.         We are following Texas law, they say, and you're wrong.              Now, what are we supposed to do about that?             Why, why, why do you say there are a lot of cases where it doesn't matter?                I would have thought every case it mattered.              Look, isn't it an absolute rule that there's a Federal issue in a case and there's a State ground, the State ground typically is a failure to raise an objection, and a State court says the Federal ground is what we're talking about.      They say nothing about the State ground and they decide the Federal ground.                The defendant goes to a Federal court and he says, I'm entitled to be released because they got the Federal ground wrong.   I thought it's a hundred percent the case, and this is where you'll correct me, that it's now too late for the State to raise the State ground but the State's waived their adequate and independent State ground and that if they try to raise it again the answer is always, not some of the time:             I'm very sorry, State; you're out of luck; you should have decided it on the State ground and not reached the Federal ground.            Why wouldn't that be the case?     Suppose the --            Suppose the State --
05-1157 +++$+++                 What happened in respect to the SEC?   What about primary jurisdiction?              That's what I wondered as I read this.           Nobody mentions it.      But there's certainly a lot of precedent in the area in this kind of thing.    You ask the agency, have to go to the agency, see what they say.              That's why I wonder about primary jurisdiction.     You put a burden on the, on the plaintiffs to go to the agency and the agency could take a range of positions.     It might say this is absolutely unlawful, BUT it's close enough we think an antitrust court has no business mucking around in this.                  Or it's unlawful and we don't care.           Or, it's not -- in which case they could bring their suit.               Or it's -- it's not unlawful but we don't care, or it's not unlawful and we do care. I mean, there is a range of positions they could take which was the purpose of the primary jurisdiction doctrine, to see in the context of the particular conduct, not general but in the context of the particular conduct, what the agency thought about this in terms of its regulatory mission.               That's in respect to the particular conduct at issue here.               Of course the Petitioners have not had an opportunity, I would think -- they filed a complaint.   But they've not had an opportunity to argue this out in front of the SEC with particular evidence, with particular witnesses, et cetera.             And even then, why do you take the other position?          It is pretty easy to imagine the SEC, under some circumstances, deciding that's a proper way to market securities, to have some kinds of agreements between IPOs or something like that.                 I don't see why not.              It is possible.        I'm back to Justice Alito's question.           I mean, if you're worried about taking authority from the Department to prosecute territorial restrictions as some kind of blatant price fix, that's not in front of us.             So this doesn't have to be precedent for that. You're talking about this case.                  And there, I think the Respondent -- the Petitioners here say that my goodness, we don't see any way that a district court is going to be able to start talking about whether this evidence is protected.       What does that mean, protected? Maybe protected here, because they have thought about it, but there will be a lot of cases where the SEC hasn't thought about the particular conduct.                 We don't know what they're going to prove. I'm back to Justice Alito.                  How is anybody going to administer the standard that you are asking the Court to enunciate?               We all agree, say a group of underwriters, that for the next we will insist that every customer, whatever price we charge, will pay 30 percent more for 50 percent more shares next month. Absolutely illegal, isn't it?               They write it down, just what I said.
05-1240 +++$+++                  What happens -- I'm trying to think of what the problem is for you.                      On January 1, your client's arrested unlawfully.                   Now suppose the rule was you have two years to file it, starting now.                      What is the problem for you?          The problem is maybe in a year, or maybe less, the police start to prosecute him.                      In the meantime, your trial is going forward because you filed it on time.    So when they start to prosecute him, you don't yet know what's going to happen.               And it could happen that he's convicted and you think it's illegal because of the arrest and necessarily so. And therefore you have to stop the trial, I guess, because of Heck.             That would work, I guess. They'd stop it and then they'd have to bring it -- you'd have to stop it and then you'd have to go through these other remedies and they you'd have to go back to it.             But that would work.             A mess.             Suppose I modify it.              Suppose it is complicated. I want to suggest a modification with this suit here. You say you have to file within two years.                       But wait, you have -- we tolled the statute.                   If the person is arrested and charged, and convicted, for all the time that is going on, it is just tolled, equitably.                       And after the conviction, if he's acquitted, by the way, or he isn't arrested, the statute starts to run again. Now if he's convicted, as long as you have filed, proceeding to challenge the conviction, it is tolled. Now, would that -- that it seems to me would help every problem you have, and it would be called equitable tolling.      And that's been suggested by judges in different forums and many states have it. And what's the problem?                        That just solves the problem, doesn't it?                 All right, well, we could do it in this case.             What cases require overruling?             Well, it seems to me identical to the rule you are advocating but with one difference.    The difference with the rule you are advocating is a judge who is going to be judge at time A with your first case, is going to have to guess whether it is in this case or not in this case necessarily related to some kind of challenge to conviction you're going to bring later if you happen to get convicted.              There is no way to guess that.              And is there anything that you are aware of that it would be contrary to?                I know there are cases that say you look to states but you only look to states where the state law is, in fact, consistent with the Federal right.               That problem is solved too if you simply say bring it, day one, you are arrested, and if in fact before the statute of limitations expires, your client is brought to the court and is going to be prosecuted.        Tolled.         They don't need two actions.               I want to be sure I understood your position with regard to Justice Kennedy's hypothetical where the defendant is arrested and excessive force is used by the police, they beat him up or something like that.          When does that cause of action accrue?
05-1256 +++$+++            Can I ask you -- are you finished?           I wanted to know what you think about a suggestion that I got from something that Justice Scalia said.    I don't know whether he was making it or not, but I'll make the suggestion and see what you think.   Suppose that this case -- suppose we were to say, there are many issues in this case, some of them very difficult, but one thing we're certain about:            You cannot in a trial consistent with the due process clause in a trial of plaintiff versus defendant take money from the defendant and give it to the plaintiff for the purpose of punishing the Defendant for something he did to a different person who wasn't there.              Now -- so he couldn't defend against him.            That person didn't present a claim.   So we are certain of that. Now, we're not certain whether that's what happened here.   It may have done.           There is certainly a lot of language to suggest it, and there is some language the other way.      So we remand it to the court with that instruction that they cannot permit this to have happened if it happened.            Whether it happened and what happened is a matter of Oregon law in large part and things about instructions, etc.              Now, what's your view of that kind of disposition?           Maybe, but it's possible the Oregon court would say:         Well, no instructions are perfect, but -- and no set of jury instructions is perfect.   But if we look at the jury instructions without the suggested one that was rejected and then we look at the suggested one, we find the suggested one had many things wrong with it, not just, you know, problems, confusion, et cetera.    We find the instructions weren't perfect but, given Oregon evidentiary law, we think the trial judge made reasonable decisions, therefore okay.           I don't know.   That's what worrying me, what's worrying me about this is I see as we try to determine what this instruction said, whether it was good enough, whether the instructions without it are good enough, that we're going to be in a kind of bog of mixtures of constitutional law, unclear Oregon State law, not certain exactly what was meant by whom in the context of the trial, et cetera.

05-128 +++$+++        If you have an employer who says, I promise to give $200 a month per worker to a fund, which money will go to pay their health costs when they're sick, that's plainly covered.       And now suppose it's exactly the same, but instead of his paying $200 a month, he pays $200 to an insurance company in return for a promise that they'll pay precisely the same amount to the employee if he gets sick.                In your view, that's not covered.       Of course.        It's not meant to be.       I want to know how you are going to answer my hypothetical. (Laughter.)       I'm not -- I'm asking you --       -- to answer my hypothetical please.        If in fact -- you didn't want me to repeat it?       Then what is the answer?       In your view, is my hypothetical covered or not?       It is not.       And therefore, if we accept your interpretation, then all those employers who, instead of contributing directly to health funds, instead buy insurance policies to do the same thing, will discover they do not have the advantage of the fifth priority.       Now, if they are covered -- if they are covered, as I thought, then what is the difference whether the employer buys a policy whereby the insurance companies pays for their health benefit when they're sick or pays for their accident benefit when they have an accident at work?       Well, that's -- that's a better way to put it.          If -- if that's right, then what you're saying, as I understand it, is in those cases where an employer goes to an insurance company, they give a contractual promise to pay the employee when he gets sick in return for a premium by the employer -- and it's a health benefit or a vacation benefit, the most typical thing -- you're saying all those -- all those -- there's no fifth priority.                    They don't -- can't take advantage of that.           Well, they're doing that to get a standard.           And I'd like to know what your -- they're trying to use that as a basis for separating the bottled water from the workmen's comp from the health benefit.              And they're saying here's an example of where Congress put the workers' comp on the same side as the health benefit.                  Now, that's their approach. What's your approach to the standard?            What rule or system would you use from deciding which insured-for or paid-for benefits count as the plan and which ones don't?       So if, in fact -- if, in fact, the State legislature mandates certain health benefits, then the plan that provides those benefits would no longer qualify.

05-130 +++$+++        On Justice Scalia's question, I was trying to think of some, and I was trying to think the analogy might -- you might find some analogy in the public utilities field, the -- or a ferris wheel or something.             What you want is a person who uses his property not at all himself, but licensed the public generally.          And now would a -- would a court issue an injunction there?             And as I think about that, I don't realize I don't know the answer.       Yes, that's what -- I mean, that -- that's what you're trying to analogize this case to, I guess, is a person who licenses others to use his property and never uses it himself.       And there, I don't know how courts do normally act in other areas of property law.
05-1342 +++$+++                 Suppose that it was a national bank.   Forget the subsidiary.                  And your State says:   Well, we want to have a law here that says we want to send our own bank examiners in.                  And moreover, we don't want them to make any loans in excess of 12 percent interest.    Fine.        Would that be constitutional? I mean, wouldn't be preempted?                Yes.                Yes, of course, because it conflicts and they don't want it.                All right.      Do they have the authority to say a subsidiary is a national bank?                No, they can't?      Where is it in the law that says they don't have the authority to say that a subsidiary of a national bank owned by a national bank is a national bank?                Is there something specifically that stops them from saying that?                What?                What is it?      What is it -- I mean, what statute or what is it that prevents them from saying it?   I don't know the Gold Foods case.              Doesn't it have exactly the same power that any other agency or Congress has?                    That it has the power, if its regulation is authorized, it has the power to what they say, preempt a state law that obstructs, impairs, or conditions a bank's ability fully to exercise its federally authorized real estate lending powers?     That's what they say, and then they list some examples. Suppose they said nothing.                  Wouldn't we be in the same boat?     After all, a state cannot under the Federal Constitution normally enact a law that interferes or stands as an obstacle to the achievement of the objective of the Federal law. So if that's right, or if it's wrong, explain why it's wrong, but if it's right, why don't you tell me whether the two laws that you are worried about do or do not stand as an obstacle to the full achievement of the purposes of the statute as implemented by their regulation?              Let's assume I don't agree with you about that, that I think conflict preemption does not require clear language.               Assume that, even though you disagree with it.            Now on my assumption that you can have the law if it doesn't conflict, but you can't have the law if it does conflict, so now you explain to me why the two laws at issue here don't conflict.               We're not looking for that. We're looking for the opposite.                As I read this, the banking agency has not said, we wipe out all of your laws.    They've said, we wipe out a subset of laws, which are defined as those laws that obstruct, impair, or limit the ability of this bank to fulfill its federally mandated powers.    Okay?        So they're just saying, we only get the ones that are in conflict.                   Now, they then have a list of which ones they preempt and which ones they don't.   So my question to you is, give me a list here of which ones they think conflict that you think don't.
05-1345 +++$+++                I guess in many thousands of municipalities throughout the United States it's fairly common to have a locally owned electricity distribution company, or an electrically -- or a gas distribution company.      And I thought it was fairly common for a municipally owned pipeline, gas pipeline, or electricity distribution to say, if you live in our town you've got to buy from us; you've got to buy from the local community.      And I guess that's been going on for about 110 years. And yet I've never seen anybody think or write or anything that that violated the Commerce Clause.   But of course, there could be somebody in another State who'd like to sell electricity to the people in our town.     They can't do it because the town says, we own the company and you got to buy from us. Now, if we agree with you are we saying that all those gas companies, distribution companies, et cetera, are behaving unconstitutionally?                No, I'm not interested in tests.   I'm interested in just the outcome.                   I just raise the question.                Well, I used to teach the subject and I can't say you're wrong.                    But I knew that it was a fairly common thing to have a certification that gave you a -- as a company, it would give them a local area in which they had an exclusive monopoly.                       And that was common and it was called a service area, and in the local town, the service area, I never even heard of a company trying to come in and sell from abroad, because I thought that this certificate gave them an exclusive right to provide the local electricity service or the natural gas service.              I mean, it's a fairly obvious thing.    And I might be wrong and I mention that my memory -- I've never focused directly on it.                    Just everybody I read and everything I read, I assumed the constitutionality of this.          But of course, memory is fallible, including mine.          Therefore, I raise the question.               No, no.         I'm not talking about that because I guess that would be trying to attack Carbone.   Far be it from me. But I know at least there are these things called municipal gas utilities and municipal electricity companies; and during the New Deal that was thought to be quite a good thing, and that's years ago.                   In all that time when people were attacking New Deal agencies, I've never seen an attack based on this ground.               Yeah, I think it would. The same logic would apply.               Well, the fact is there is a difference between public ownership and giving an exclusive franchise to a public company.                   And the public ownership means that the people of the State have decided to have their own little nationalized industry, which again people don't like, many.                   But I never knew there was anything in the Constitution that forbid it.               Nationalized industries?             Well, there is still at least the obvious distinction, that one of the main purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause is to prevent protectionism.    Protectionism is when a state favors its own producers.    And you could see, indeed a big argument in Carbone was, you aren't favoring your own producer; well, we are at least favoring one.                      But now where the municipality is running it itself, no one is favored. So I don't think it was an object of the Commerce Clause to prevent a State from favoring its own government.             Well, it's about --             Well, is there something here that is not protection?             Because Carbone was still perhaps viewing it most favorably, an extreme case of protection, only one individual was protected.             Here, I take it the reason they want to do this is because they wanted their municipal facility to charge a higher price for the non-recyclable rubbish and that will encourage people to segregate the rubbish and thereby have more cyclable -- recyclable rubbish, and therefore overall pay less. And that's why they want to do it, and of course that's not going to work.                If somebody comes in from out of State and charges a lower price for all of the non-recyclable rubbish or you know, for all rubbish, it just won't work.      It is rather like electricity, interestingly enough, where municipalities would do the same thing.    They want discriminatory rates in order to push out the possibility of poorer people getting electricity.    This they want to do the same thing but they want to do it for rubbish, for, to encourage recycling.                 Like it --                 I actually point out that California, I think, wants to own the grid and privatize the rest of it.   And there are -- I mean, it -- Justice Kennedy is totally right.                  There are all kinds of combinations and permutations.                  There, there could be distributors who are in fact regulated private companies and local distributors who are owned by the city, and I guess there, there is one generator, at least, company that's owned by the -- that's a -- TV -- with TVA. They, they make their own. So there are all kinds of permutations and combinations.    And I think we're getting at, when we take that aspect of the permutation and combination and say that aspect of it which is owned by a Government says:    "Our way or the highway."              You know, that's what they say.    "Buy from us."         Period. And if you're in a certain region, I've always thought they could do that.                  And I have to admit I never really looked it up; I've just never came across a case that says to the contrary.
05-1429 +++$+++              Question --                 I'm sort of back where Justice Kennedy started on this.                 Forget -- I'd like to forget your case, because your case seems to me to be a case where parties argue reasonably about whether the contract itself covers this kind of fee.               And maybe it doesn't, if it's very unreasonable, et cetera. But let's take a very straightforward case. It's an obvious contract to collect a debt, or maybe a mortgage, and in the debt or the mortgage agreement, it says, attorneys' fees will be paid for collection.               It clearly covers bankruptcy, too, by its language. And now there must be many instances or some, anyway, where the security is inadequate.              And there must be other instances in which there wasn't any security.              And if I read Collier as you pointed to, that seems to say, in such cases, very simple, the creditor has the status of an unsecured creditor in respect to those attorneys' fees.              Overage in the secured case, and the whole claim in the unsecured case.              So get in the queue and you can collect your pro-rata share.              My question is, I have 19 professors on the other side coming to tell me that that's never happened.         They can't even find an instance.     So it isn't as if, it isn't as if you haven't found an instance, it is that they are prepared to say it never happened.      And then there may be one exception or two or something like that. And I can't, that -- I'm now totally puzzled.    Because if it's so clear as you say, and I follow your logic, and I followed Collier, why?                     After all, there are bankrupt people who do have some assets. Explain it.               You would have thought that the one group of people who ought to know this thoroughly, or at least have a view are the bankruptcy bar.               And, and yet there are no briefs from them; there are not -- there is no article that I could find in Bankruptcy Journal.
05-1448 +++$+++              I'm just listening to this. It sounds to me as if you're saying, one, the employer decides to terminate, okay?            Now that's done.         Then we go to the next question.         How would we terminate?               And in respect to that, I think Justice Kennedy was asking, as I heard him, don't you have a fiduciary duty when you decide how.    And your answer, as I heard it, was yes, you do. And now there is a third question.                    Does what happened in terminating mean that although you have a fiduciary duty, you couldn't consider a merger, because that's just not consistent with the basic plan of terminating.     Is that right?             If it's wrong, don't even bother to answer it.              Why did you answer yes to his question, Justice Kennedy's, about the insurance company?
05-1508 +++$+++              Yes, but what do you distribute?             What do you distribute?    I mean, I agree you have a, some kind of, let's put something on cards, so you have thousands of cards and each one has a number on it.             What are you distributing -- the cards?    Are you, are you -- what's distribute -- a 5th percentile refers to some kind of distribution. What's it a distribution of?             Is it a thing?             Like a -- like a set of things that you're distributing, what are they?             In other words, you take all the -- there is a set of numbers, each number is a different number and the characteristic of each number is there some school district that spends per, or takes in per pupil, revenue equal to that number.              So we write each one on a card.      Is that what we're, is that our distribution?     We have like, let's say we have a, a thousand cards.     Is that what it is?                 No.     No.      I'm not, I'm saying what do you think it has to be?                     What do you think it should be?       What are, what is it we are distributing?     A simple question, I guess, for a statistician.     I unfortunately am not one and can't find one, so I have no idea what this statute means. (Laughter.)                 Not a value.        I want to know what I'm distributing.              And if you don't know I would say that this is, I have never seen a case so much better fitted for relying on the views of an agency.                 I'm sorry, I don't know how --                So, so in other words we are distributing those cards, it's a set of numbers?                      If you're certain, isn't it fair to say that this statute is not clear as to what it is you're distributing?                Well, I -- I thought not. Is there a --             Yeah -- that -- right.            But I unfortunately don't know enough about this subject, so I thought, not being an expert on it, that when you referred to a percentile, you have some group of things, a set of things that's being distributed in a certain order and there is a top of that and a bottom of that.             And if that's what percentile refers to, I just want to know what those things are that are being distributed.                    And - and that's where I find the ambiguity.            And if there is an ambiguity, I guess we are going to take the view of the agency at least as I understand it.                     So -- so that's why I asked the question.             And does the statute say you have to do it that way?            It has to be the group that's distributed?              Clearly.              No, you could do it that way and the reason the Government, I think, says that you shouldn't do it that way is that it would produce an absurd result.              That the object of the statute is to catch the outliers.               And if you, for example, had one giant school district like New York City which was at the top of the list and another giant school district that was at the bottom of the list you would cut those two out, and you might have cut out half the pupils in the whole State, and those wouldn't be outliers would they?      I mean, that's the problem.                 It, it eliminates 26 school districts but those 26 school districts account for 5 percent or 10 percent of the pupils.                      And I guess what we are interested in here is not school districts; they are not a thing -- they are a thing of a kind, but we are interested in students, real people who get money. And so that it, that it -- it eliminates 26 percent of the school districts would see, to be a good thing, not a bad thing, because what we are really interested in are the pupils and it keeps in 90 percent of the pupils.                That's all right.       I wouldn't think that was a problem.                   But what about Justice Stevens' question.            There are 20 districts in our State -- it's exaggerated, let me exaggerate it -- and the rich district has 20, has a quarter of the students, and the poor district has another quarter.                        So our outliers in that situation which we're eliminating from our calculation are the rich district and the poor district.   One's at the top, one's at the bottom.                    And now we're left with 18 districts to figure out whether they're equalized.      But those 18 districts account for less than half or about half of all the students. That's the problem.       It seems that isn't very representative and we're trying to get representativeness.                I understand that.      If the language doesn't permit it you can't do it, they can't, and you win.   But if the language does permit it, the reason -- you have to stretch the language, I suspect, in my view to get to the Government's result.                       It might just barely permit it.        But one of the things on their side is that if we take your view it produces an absurd result, because of what Justice Ginsburg said, because there is such variation in the number of pupils among school districts in different states.
05-1541 +++$+++               Why isn't the obvious difference -- I may have missed this -- but you say, in the case, a taxpayer owed some money and the Government via a lien took property from a different person who then had to pay the tax who then had to get rid of the lien and wanted it back.         And in this case they did exactly the same thing but they did it via a levy.                  So you say if the first could sue so could the second. But the difference, the obvious difference, which maybe you have explained and I missed, is that in the second case, namely this case, there is a specific statute that says you have to do it with a levy in nine months, and in the other case there wasn't such a statute.    Why isn't that the obvious difference?             Encompasses a lien for a refund action in the case where you took the property via a lien.    And you'd say -- they say, I guess, but it doesn't encompass it when you take it via a levy.                  Why not?    Because of the specific, the same thing I just said.    Now I want to be sure I have your whole answer to that.               If your interpretation is correct then are there many such cases where the Government takes property via a levy and the person who wants to sue would get worried about nine months, because obviously he would think I can sue under a -- kind of thing.   It's two years.             So are there still some where he would have to worry about nine months?               In other words, are -- in your interpretation, does the nine-month statute become meaningless?                 The -- the, the statute that you point to talks about taking a civil action against the United States.            When there has been a wrongful levy, is that right?                 It doesn't say an injunctive action.      So I would reading it think it encompasses both actions for injunctions, which are rare, probably, and what I think is not rare at all, an action for damages or money back.                  Now your reading of the statute takes that whole ordinary case, where people are just suing to get back some money, and it says our nine-month statute of limitations here is meaningless. All it applies to are injunctive actions which I bet are far and few between.        You can tell me I'm wrong on that.                 I won't say you've made it meaningless but you have eviscerated it.                  Is that fair?              You want to say no to that. (Laughter.)              Why would it have?   Because there I think we are talking about liens and it doesn't cover liens, the specifics statute.
05-1575 +++$+++               Even if it is incorrect, if we -- we don't know precisely what he meant by the words he said, why doesn't that argue even more strongly for a hearing?    At the hearing he wants to introduce, doesn't he, his stepparents, or foster parents, a school teacher, the various others?              And he'll say anyone who listens to those people will see that I have the most horrendous upbringing anyone could have.                  The worst you've ever heard. And my argument is that if only my lawyer had looked into this at that moment in the trial, he would have said in the sentencing proceeding, look what I can present for you.        And if he had done it and told me that, anyone would have said, "of course, present it."    And I want a chance to show that that's true of my case. Now, why shouldn't he have a hearing on that?    No hearing was given him in the State court.              In State court he didn't.              Well, I mean, is the requirement such that when you ask for a hearing in a State court on a general matter, "I would like to show through a hearing," then he gives a whole lot of affidavits of the kind of thing he's going to produce, that then the State says "no," you go into Federal court and say "I'm roughly going to do the same thing, I have a few extra witnesses, some of the people say some extra things," no, you can't do that?                 Didn't he say my claim is ineffective assistance?                 Yeah.       Because he didn't investigate to discover the horrendous circumstances in which I was raised, and had he done it, he would have found roughly this kind of thing, and I would like to show that he should have done that because it would have changed the result?
05-1589 +++$+++               If that's what they intended, then how can a State say, well, it's the union's money, we don't want you to send this little bit of your money to contribute in a campaign, but if the local swimming team wants to, or the bar association or the corporation, if they want to spend money that people have given them for totally other purposes, the compulsory bar association, well, they can do that. It's just the labor unions that can't spend the money that these people forced to belong -- you know, they have to object affirmatively -- but all the other similar organizations, they can't.              Well, now you're talking about this other purpose, but that other purpose, which is rather interesting -- I take it that's one of the main points on the other side -- the other purpose has nothing to do with this case.               If Washington wanted to have a similar statute where it was worried about protecting the interests of the compelled member or the compelled payor, fine, fine, that would be a different case.   That isn't this case.               In this case they couldn't care less about that.               That's true, but in that case, in that case they didn't have a State Supreme Court interpreting the statute which is just as you started off saying it was, which has nothing to with the rights of the nonmember, zero.                It has to do with the appearance of fairness in the election.              Do they get their money back?   If this is upheld and I'm an agency member, I hate the union, can't stand it, gave them the $20 for this and they spent it on a political candidate I hate even more and you win, do I get my $20 back or can the union just spend my $20 on something else?              I'm trying to get at the question is this the union's money or is this the workers', the teachers' money?             So does he get this money back if they violate the statute.              If that's yes, then the category here is election speech.                  If you're going to call a statute that treats election speech especially, then all of campaign finance regulation would fall in that category.   And if you're going to use that distinction to say strict scrutiny applies, then strict scrutiny would apply to all campaign finance regulation. And courts never to my knowledge apply strict scrutiny to campaign finance regulation because there are speech interests on both sides of the equation.                 I'm glad you said yes to me because that implies a no to the last question. (Laughter.)
05-1629 +++$+++ 
05-1631 +++$+++                  I'm not sure why you concede that.     I mean, I looked at the case and it seemed to me it's a case involving the whole ball of wax.   And I suspect my reaction to that tape was in part affected by the fact that he went through the shopping center, came out and crashed into a police car, which is what Scott saw.              So how do I know whether, which of these things is directly or not indirectly -- well, you go ahead.     But I mean, are you -- am I not supposed to look at the part which involves the shopping center?              Why are these absolute?             I mean I looked at Garner and then I looked at Graham and Graham which came later said that all claims that officers have used excessive force, deadly or not, should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment and its reasonableness standard.        So I guess-- isn't that right, isn't that the law?              All right, if that's the law, then whether -- of course an automobile could, could kill people.      Of course it can.                   So can a lot of things.   But an automobile isn't a gun, and a chase on the highway is not a chase through a back yard, though both could end up with the person being chased dead. So aren't we supposed to look at all the circumstances, including the circumstance of what -- one that interests me, one, is that the right standard? Two, did Scott know that the reason he was chasing this person was because he had violated a speed limit, or was he ignorant of the reason why the individual was racing away at 90 miles an hour, which is as far as the record could show?              And a reasonable juror could not conclude to the contrary?             Why, why wouldn't it matter?   I mean, other things being equal, suppose that he known that all that happens, suppose he was two miles beyond the speed limit.         And Scott knew the whole thing or Scott was the one who did it, and he says maybe he is a young kid who is frightened and he has his license number and he could get him later.                  I mean, why wouldn't it be nutty to -- to try to bump somebody off the road, when all, that's all that's at stake?              What am I supposed to do? I mean, I'll look again at the tape.                      I certainly will do that.     But suppose I look at the tape and I end up with Chico Marx's old question with respect to the Court of Appeals:     Who do you believe, me or your own eyes?
05-18 +++$+++           But does it make it possible to read -- I mean, I agree with you it doesn't say to do that, but I guess you could read it to do that, couldn't you?            I mean, you said the word cost wasn't ambiguous.       Maybe you might be right, maybe absolutely, but might you also be wrong?                  How is it not ambiguous?        It might cover -- it might cover the fees of consultants.          It might be that the argument you made is right, but it also mightn't.       Which involved this statute?       All right.        Well, I mean, we have a statute and they're using the word costs in the statute, and whatever they used in some other statute they might have meant something different in this statute.         And my question is simply how do we know they didn't by just reading the word five times, particularly since, in fact, if you look at another part of the statute, they do seem to use the word cost to include number of hours spent by personnel, including consultants, and the expenses incurred.                  I mean, can you say -- is there a dictionary that says the word costs couldn't include that?       Well, once you say it could, then possibly it's reasonable to ask what the Congress Members were actually thinking, and as soon as we look at what they were actually thinking, that's perfectly clear.       Isn't it?   Because both the conference report and the Senate report say absolutely clearly that they intended this kind of expense to be used, which is why the GAO went out and did all the studies to include it.       It's true, but --       That's certainly possible. I just wonder why don't we look and see what they intended, since they told us.              In the conference report, they say the conferees intend the phrase, attorneys' fees as part of costs, to include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable cost of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of a parent or guardian's case in the action or proceeding.                So why are we metaphysically trying to guess what Congress intended when they told us what they intended?       My question is why don't we just look and see what they intended since they wrote it down on a piece of paper and all we have to do is read it?           I thought it did.   I thought that the conferees in Congress wrote in the conference report precisely what they intended.           Oh, I'd like you to respond to it. (Laughter.)        So it's not correct it's just for one house.           It's -- what I have is the Joint Explanatory Committee, and it says the managers, on the part of the House and the Senate.        All right. And is there some rule -- I don't know what this rule is you can't refer to legislative history. Does it say that in the Constitution of the United States?        No.     And so --          Which ones are voted on? I've not heard of that.              I mean, they might be, but it used to be that the -- they circulate the report to all the Members and the Members read it, and if a Member disagrees with it, they note their dissent.                 Maybe it's changed.         But I guess --            I didn't have an opportunity to work for a Senator who, in fact, to my experience asked me to report on a vote on such a thing.                       I just wasn't aware of it.       Well, one thing here --         No.     Of course --         You can't use red if the statute says green.          Green doesn't include red.         I understand that.          And that's why, in fact, I wondered if the presence in this bill of the GAO section suggests in the bill itself the possibility that the word cost means something special.                  And if that's so, then I would think it is ambiguous enough to refer to the legislative history.             It's not like using the word red and arguing it includes green.
05-184 +++$+++            But if you have to --           -- approximately the same procedures, what's the point of having a military commission?            I think that was implicit in Justice Scalia's question.         So, if you go back -- Revolution, Seminoles, Modoc, Mexican War, World War II -- why have them?
05-200 +++$+++        Is there any significant variation among the different carriers as to the terms of the contracts they use in different places for Federal employees?       Under this program.       Is there a lot or a little?       What I'm thinking of is a statute.         The statute has fairly close detail as to what the contracts must contain.                It gives authority to OMB or -- to write regs.            And they have written regs that have very detailed provisions as to what the contracts must contain, and then there is the contract with the individual carried -- when the -- when the carrier is implementing these rules, regulations, and statutes.       And I'm trying to figure out is --       It gives some.       It gives some.       Yes, I know, but I'm trying --       Insofar as the individual carriers write contracts with their covered employees, i.e., me and you and other people, and there's a lot of variation, I would say there's a lot of private going on.      But insofar as those contracts are dictated by what OPM says, then it looks more to me like a regular Federal program.       And I'm trying to get a handle on that.       So in other words, when I sign a contract, or anyone who's a Federal employee, it's OPM who effectively sets those terms?            No, I understand.       You mean everybody in the entire United States gets the same piece of paper.       So it's identical.        There is no difference between every individual's contract, every Federal employee's -- I guess it's a contract with the Federal employee.             Isn't it?       I mean, he's bound by it you say.       All right.        So I am -- in Alaska, Virginia, everywhere, they get the same piece of paper.         They enroll and then they're bound by it.       And the question here is whether that should get different interpretations possibly in different places.
05-204 +++$+++         May I just clarify one thing on that?        I take it your reason was that in Bush v. Vera, the Court said, of course, they can use race to prevent retrogression.                Of course, they can, but if they do, they have to create a compact majority minority district, not an elongated majority --        That's the -- that's the argument.         I have to go back and look at Bush v. Vera.            Oh, well, that's -- but now, in fairness, I think to the red brief argument -- you've read the red briefs.           Yes.     They are filled with factual information that in their opinion shows that previously the Democrats had gerrymandered this much worse, and that what -- this was an effort to create a balance.         That's what their view is.              Now, I want to know really precisely what is your response to that argument.           Now, what do I look to in the record to verify what you just said?        What is the answer?      I mean, you've read the briefs.            The obvious reply to that is there are many, many districts in the United States where African American voters have a big influence on the Democratic primary.        A lot.      And there are a lot where the Democrat wins.             So if your principle is accepted, says the other side, that means that any district that's drawn here to favor the Democrats can't be changed, but all the ones that favor the Republicans can be changed.        Now, if that argument is right, it's hard for me to accept, but that's a neutral principle of constitutional law.           So I want to see what -- what your response is to that.        Obviously you're not. That's why I would like --        -- you to say what specifically the answer to that argument is.
05-259 +++$+++              Well, the answer would be because Congress is worried that people won't complain. That's why.              And there are millions of ways of harassing people.              They start issuing a complaint.            You do all kinds of things.                 You freeze them out.       You -- you insult them.         You -- I mean, it's easy to think of things that don't rise to the level of the -- Ellerth. So, I mean, if I -- maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong, but if I'm right, why not just take, say, the D.C. Circuit standard?             They -- they say that you have to show that the employer's action would have been material, which means the action might well have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.                Now, how about that?   That has the virtue of allowing a person not to be harassed, et cetera, who wants to make a complaint, and it also allows the judge to focus on the particular case and see if what the person is doing is reasonable.               It holds the complainant to a standard of reasonableness, which is common in law.        Well, in fact, if it turns out to be the power lunch of all time and, in fact, the person can't be at the power lunch because she's a woman, for example, and therefore, her future career is likely to take a real nose dive, why shouldn't that count as a violation?              Why?     Why?    You see, I can think of a million things.                   I can't think literally of a million, but it does seem --              -- to me there are many, many possible ways of really discouraging a worker from complaining that are not quite as tangible as the list under 703.          So the D.C. Circuit -- and I think even the SG here, which seems like a variation of the D.C. Circuit -- much -- the standards seem much -- not as different as you might -- as it seems to me you're saying.        But -- but they're -- they're trying to be a little vaguer and a bit broader than the specific Ellerth language because they recognize there are many possible ways of seriously injuring a person with the intent or -- to stop them from complaining.             That gives effect to the language differences.        It leaves it up to case-by- case.       It leaves it up to the administrative agency, all in areas where I frankly don't know one lunch from another.        I don't know one lunch from another often, but the -- the EEOC might and -- and so might a judge who hears evidence.        And that's the virtue of their standard.
05-260 +++$+++         Suppose in the 18th century -- I'm not an expert in this.               You're more of one.     But suppose you had an absolute classical trust.                It's the -- it's a trust for the benefit of the fifth grandchild of the Duke of Hamilton.             All right?        The trustee.      And this trustee, going to the fifth grandchild one day, lends him 1,000 pounds, and he takes his security.                The grandchild says, 4 years from now my great, great Aunt Margaret is likely to die and she's going to leave me my ring -- her ring.          And the -- the trustee says, fine.       When you get the ring, give it to me and that's repayment.          Yes, okay, done. Now, the great, great grandchild being a bit of a --       All right.        My question is could the trustee go to the equity court and say, there it is.       It's in his pocket.          Equity court, I'd like you to order that ring to be given to the trust.                  Can that happen?       It depends.        They couldn't get that?       What does it depend on?       The great grandson's intent was to get the money as fast as he could, and, in fact, he thinks -- when he'll get the ring, he thinks he'll give it back to the trust but -- at least -- yes. That's what he thinks.       In other words, a court of equity could not have taken the ring?       Like -- what it is it?       You have to go back to the 15th century or the 16th?                 Is there -- is there a case?            There must have been cases like that.         Well, then suppose there are no other creditors.         There's no other creditor.         See, he goes -- there's nobody.        All there is is the ring.             Nobody else makes any claim to it whatsoever.               Now can the -- can the trustee get it?         No.         No.     He has no money.    All he has is the ring in his pocket.
05-352 +++$+++  
05-380 +++$+++             Just from my going through this record, I compare it with Stenhart, with what's in Congress.     We have two cases here.              And it's a fair conclusion that there are, in each case, before Congress and in here, there are some doctors who think this is safe and some doctors who think it isn't safe. And if you look at the -- sort of by counting, by numbers, I guess if you look by lines of testimony or by different doctors, interestingly enough, it seems to me there are more doctors in these two cases and in front of Congress who said it is not safe than there were when we considered the other case.              And there are fewer doctors who say it is safe even with the other case.   So I don't know if you're supposed to count doctors or what. My question would be, if this -- do we owe more deference to a congressional finding or to Congress than we owe to a State legislature?              What is -- I mean, I take it a State legislature is democratically elected, and don't we owe similar deference to both?            Well, if we owe deference to both, and I would have thought that we did, then I think in the Nebraska case, despite the deference that was owed, the Court came to the conclusion that the statute of Nebraska was unconstitutional because it lacked an exception for the health of the mother, something that came from preceding cases.              So if giving deference to Nebraska, we reach that conclusion there, and if the deference that is owed is the same, and if the evidence is about the same on both sides, how can we reach a different conclusion here?              If -- I see what you're driving at in terms of the procedure.              We are focusing on a universe where the fetus is not going to survive no matter what, right?            Okay.        So we are not talking about anyone being born and living.                They are not going to.            And that's the area of focus.            Now, Congress has said that -- the doctor, you can achieve that result through method A, but not through method B, and you're saying Congress had good reason for doing that.         I take it Congress also agrees that if method B, which they don't want, were to be necessary for the safety or health of the mother, the Constitution would require it being done.                I didn't see anything here about Congress disagreeing with that.            All right.       If that's right --            Right.       Fine.   Okay.   They make a finding that although we don't disagree with that, we don't think it's ever necessary for the health or safety of the mother.        That's where we are.        Now as I look at the record, I see many, many, many doctors telling Congress and everybody else that it is necessary, and safe.      And I see other doctors telling Congress primarily, but in court, too, that it isn't necessary, ever for safety. And so if medical opinion is divided, and I'm not advocating what I'm about to say, I just want to know your reaction.     If medical opinion is divided, why wouldn't it be up to this Court or could this Court say this use of this procedure, we enjoin the statute to permit its use but only where appropriate medical opinion finds it necessary for the safety or health of the mother? Now, if Congress is right, there will be no such case so it's no problem.              But if Congress is wrong, then the doctor will be able to perform the procedure and Congress couldn't object to that because the Congress isn't worried about, I mean Congress, then Congress was wrong.     They agreed that we had a health or safety exception.          No.     It just wouldn't be a question of the doctor's preference.              You would have to refer back to prior cases, and what the prior cases talk about including Stenberg is not that that the doctor simply has a preference, but rather that there has to be a significant body of medical opinion that says that this is safer procedure and necessary for the safety of the mother. Now, where that's true, the Court has previously said that the Constitution protects the right.   And I don't see anything in what Congress says that wants to change that law.             They simply have a different view of the facts.              So if they have a different view of the facts, why can't we leave it up to whatever facts develop?    If there is an appropriate body of medical opinion that does in fact believe this is necessary for the health of the mother, so be it, and the abortion could be performed and the injunction would say that.              And otherwise not.

05-409 +++$+++             Well, it doesn't -- what Thermtron says is that we read (d) in conjunction with (c).      Now, the reason that (c) is relevant here is because it says, if at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject- matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded. Presumably what (c) is thinking of are cases where subject-matter jurisdiction is not the whole issue before the -- the Federal court.                      It's thinking that subject-matter jurisdiction in certain instances, like a defect in a removal proceeding, is something that the -- that the Federal court could get to prior to a final judgment. But here, the final judgment in the Federal court is the very question of whether this is preempted or not.        And therefore, I guess what Easterbrook is thinking is that that isn't the kind of subject-matter jurisdiction dismissal to which (c) refers. Consequently, it is not within the scope of (d)'s no appellate review rule.           No.     It's no doubt that all the lower courts then would be wrong.                      But the reason he says that they are wrong is because they looked at the word, subject-matter jurisdiction, in (c) without realizing that the reference in (c) is a reference to instances where subject-matter jurisdiction is not the whole issue; i.e., it's something other than the final Federal court decision.           That would be the argument he's making.             I would like your response.          I agree with you.          You would also have to say that the same rule applies, one, to the complete preemption cases and, two, to sovereign immunity determinations under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act.            But he would say that may be so, but nonetheless, Judge Easterbrook would say, well, so be it.      That's what Congress intended.                   That is wrong to deprive someone of a right to appeal when it turns on a misreading of (c) and an incorporation of the misreading into (d).       Would it make sense --       Does it make -- what's worrying me in the back of my mind is we have decided Dabit since this case was brought.                 Then I thought, well, could we remand this case in light of Dabit. Now, if we did that, we wouldn't decide the issue that you all want decided, and we'd let this, unfortunately, slightly confused situation continue to exist. What would be the consequence of that?          Are there -- are there a lot of cases, or is this something that comes up often?         I'm trying to think.            It seems if you -- it ought to work out similarly to what happens in a case where there's a Federal issue that you remove under.          Now you've removed.              And there also is a State issue pendent.              Now, what the judge does is he says, defendant, you win on the Federal issue, and I'm going to send this thing back now, remand it, because I don't think I want to maintain here the State issue.       And so it's a remand order.                 The case is remanded. Now, I think you get an appeal on your Federal issue there.           And then -- then why shouldn't -- if that's so, shouldn't this work out the same way?          Shouldn't it work out the same?       Then the district court was wrong too I guess because the district court made the same --
05-416 +++$+++           They're saying that it's special here.            If you look at the language of the text, the language talks -- is almost identical to the language that was in CRIPA, or whatever is -- you know, CRIPA.                    Is that the correct pronunciation of the concatenation of --       I'm think -- oh, well, I guess it isn't -- unlike IIRIRA, it is apparently unknown.       There was a predecessor act, and the predecessor act used this same language, just about.       And what it said was, "Judge, you may require exhaustion of such remedies as are available."                 And, given that language, nobody thought that was a procedure default rule; it just meant the judge, if there's a remedy available, can say, "Prisoner, go do it," in an appropriate case.        And all that happened here, if you look at the history, is, they changed the "may" to a "must." And all the people that wrote in were writing in about that.       Nobody dreamt, nobody said, nothing suggests, that what Congress intended to do was to bring in the procedural default aspect of it.              And there would have been a lot of objections if they had.                 So, that's the argument the other way. Now, I'd like to know what do you have at all that overcomes what I just said?          Before you get to the purposes, you quote in your brief -- the only legislative history I could find here -- you said that Congressman LoBiondo referred to MCCarthy, which you find relevant, because MCCarthy indicated that the word "exhaustion" would carry along with it a procedural default rule.                 So, what did the Congressman say?       Uh-huh.       Uh-huh.       All right.         So, I take it from your answer he didn't really say anything helpful to you --       -- except to refer to the name of the case --       -- in which case, what we have on the -- all right.           Is that right?         Well, wouldn't it go -- wouldn't that apply -- that principle apply to reasonable -- unreasonable remedies?             You have to have a reasonable remedy.        I don't see how you can decide to import half of administrative law and not the other half.         It's not just a filing deadline.         It's the whole procedure.             I mean, Rehnquist -- Chief Justice Rehnquist, in MCCarthy, lists a bunch of reasons in cases where the process subjects the plaintiffs to unreasonable delay, to an indefinite timeframe.               And there could be others.          The normal thing is, you excuse exhaustion where the exhaustion requirement was such that the person couldn't reasonably comply. Now, either you do want to import that into this statute, or not.         And if you do not, then I think you're asking us to say we import what goes normally with the word "exhaustion," where it favors the Government, but not what normally goes with the word "exhaustion" where it doesn't.          Why did they use the word "until," instead of the word "unless"?
05-465 +++$+++        Suppose we get through that. I see the artificial part.               Just what is it?   Piling Pelion on something or other.                Mountains that you pile one on top of the other. But your opponents have cited in your brief -- in the brief on page 12 that counsel for Mohawk said to the court, specifically, Mohawk agrees that a corporation can be both a RICO person and part of an association-in-fact enterprise.                Now, if we can overcome all these other problems --       -- what do we do about that particular concession?        Well, what -- what sense would it make on the merits to get your interpretation on the merits, which would mean, I guess, that five individuals could be an enterprise because that's a group of individuals.       Five labor unions couldn't. Five corporations couldn't.              One individual and four labor unions couldn't.           One individual and four corporations couldn't.           One individual and three partnerships couldn't.           And -- but what -- what sense would that make?
05-493 +++$+++ 
05-502 +++$+++ 
05-5224 +++$+++            Well, you started out by saying that the purpose of the Confrontation Clause was to keep out the accusations made out of court, but I would have thought that was the purpose of the hearsay rule.       And if that's the purpose of the hearsay rule, how does the Confrontation Clause differ?           Ah, so it's not the purpose of the Confrontation Clause to keep out out-of-court accusations.             Only some, and which, and what's the rule?           I know you do believe that, but I want to know why in terms of the purposes of not the hearsay --           -- rather the confrontation.       How would you do that?        How would you do that forfeiture?       How would you do that?        I'm interested in that because I thought it sounded good. Then I thought about it.            I thought to have forfeiture, you'd have to show that this defendant, in fact, forced the wife not to testify.            It's a crime to do that.        So you'd have to prove another crime against the defendant in order to prove the first crime.                 And I thought perhaps that doctrine is not very practical.                You tell me why it is.       I understand that.      My point is that to prove the wrongdoing would probably be even harder than to prove the original crime.                     All we know is the wife isn't there.            And we suspect that she's afraid of her husband.                He may have offered to cut off financial aid, said goodbye, no money, or he may have done worse.              I'm just saying you're telling us that because the prosecution can prove that in court and only then will it be able to introduce the testimony given beforehand by the missing wife.            How does it work?       This is true, but the reason I thought spousal abuse cases are relevant --       A reason I thought they were relevant is just what you're about to address.               They're evidentiary of the problem that exists when you bring something within the Confrontation Clause.               Prior to Crawford, even though it was within the clause, if it fell within a well-recognized exception to the hearsay rule, it could come in.           So you could bring in co- conspirators before the conspiracy ended.               You could bring in, for sure, excited utterances.                You could bring in all kinds of things that now, no matter how reliable, you have to keep them out.       And so that is a problem that you have to address in respect to drawing a fairly narrow line, and I want to know what that narrow line is with spousal abuse and other cases in mind.       That may be hearsay.    That may all be hearsay.
05-547 +++$+++         But that's ambiguous.          That's perfectly ambiguous.    Because, the case of your client, it is a felony, and it is punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.        No, that's --             -- right.   But it is a felony under South Dakota law.     And what the statute says -- and that's the Government's argument -- they say "any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act."         They don't mean, necessarily, any felony punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act.          It might mean anything that is a --         -- felony, and --         -- it is also punishable; in which case, you lose.   But, in the first case, you win.         So, what am I supposed to look to, to decide which is --         Uh-huh.           Oh, but you don't mean that, because you're prepared to concede -- at least I thought you were, until your last argument -- you're prepared to concede that if a person engages in a crime that is punishable as a felony under South Dakota law, and it is also punishable as a felony under Federal law, under 801, et seq, well, that counts.           Do you --           Do you concede that --           -- or not?           You --           -- you say your answer is, you don't make the concession?        Do you work in --        -- this area?         In the Southern --         In the -- have you ever heard of, or had, a client -- or heard of a person from Mexico who had been deported because he has been involved in drugs, and the Government wants to bring him back because he may be a witness -- maybe something develops, some other members of the gang are there, they'd like his information?         So, if --         -- they pick up some friends of his who are engaged in drugs, the Government might decide to try to get him back.        Well, it's conceivable, I guess, that people will break their parole.              Often it doesn't happen; sometimes it does.               Sometimes they want to get him back; sometimes they don't.
05-593 +++$+++            If that's your answer, can I go back to the other main issue for a second?              I would have thought that your case, unfortunately for you in my mind, is the classic case where there should be jurisdiction because the AG is supposed to say look, I don't think anything happened, okay?              So he was doing his job all day.   But if something did happen, I'll tell you what, it was within the scope of his employment. And apparently, that's just what they did say here.                 And then it got mixed up in the courts below.              In other words, if he made some phone calls and even if he mentioned the employee, even if he said something improper, it was within the scope of his employment, which is just what they said.            So because of that, it seems to me this makes a lot of complexity out of nothing.    Now you explain what your answer is.           In the district court he didn't say, if something happened here, it was in the scope of his employment?       I thought he had.       Maybe he hadn't.    I thought he had, but I'll ask him that.           In the district court I thought he said that.           Well, it was there first, but you can argue in the defense alternative, I think nothing happened.    But if the plaintiff can convince a jury otherwise, fine, but then what they can convince him of is within the scope of his employment.           Now did that happen in the district court, that they said something like that or not?             Well, why can't they do that, which is just what Wood says they can do, if anybody, you know, thinks that's valid?           But the -- what's the problem then?       Because I would have thought that the reason this case appears difficult is because yours is a case where the AG should be able to come in and remove it.             But it's wrong in that, isn't it?             I mean, the Wood issue was the issue of where if anything happened, of course it's outside the scope.    It's like one employee shoots another, you know.    There is nothing to do with scope of employment there, it's plainly outside.           And of course, this act, in my view then, then, was that this is not an act that allows the AG to defend that kind of thing. But if it's arguable at least that something happened, if it happened at all it was within the scope of employment, the AG can defend it.          What's the problem with -- there should be a problem with what I say from your point of view, so --           So you're saying they have abandoned the argument?
05-595 +++$+++ 
05-5966 +++$+++            No --           -- what they have here -- the      -- what the SG says -- which seemed right to me, and I would like you to explain why it wasn't -- is that as far as the insanity defense is concerned, that everyone in Arizona agrees that you consider whether he knows right from wrong in respect to this act.                    Thus, if he thinks the truckdriver is an alien, or he thinks he's an animal, and has a serious mental problem in knowing what's going on, that comes right in, as it did here, because it's relevant to whether he knew it was right or wrong to shoot this person.                    And, therefore, once I read that, I thought there is not, at least in this case, a question of whether the insanity defense is complete, because it is.                 Everything that you wanted to introduce was introduced.                 And, indeed, it was considered, properly, under the insanity defense.                    And if you had convinced the jury, you would -- or the -- I guess, the jury -- you would have won on that.                   Now, am I -- what's wrong with what I've just said?        Yes, but I'm interested in Arizona, remember.          I'm not -- what I'm interested in is whether if you say, "Judge, I am going to prove the following.          My client knows right from wrong, in general, but he thought that the truckdriver was a wild animal, and that delusion meant that he is so insane, he could not have formed the necessary intent."                The judge replies, "You can bring that in, because if he thought the driver was a mental -- was a wild animal, he did not know right from wrong in respect to this killing."         Now, is that what happened --       -- in effect?      Or would -- did the judge say, "You may not introduce that evidence, because it is not relevant"?       In this case.       Well, fine.       So, then, what is -- would -- if he thought it was a wild animal, then he would not have known right from wrong in respect to killing that individual.            What is it?            No, but whether it --        Then, what do you do --       All right, if that's --            But the Arizona Court, the Court of Appeals, writes that it turns on the finding of criminal responsibility at the time of the criminal offense.         It is difficult to imagine that a defendant who did not appreciate the nature and quality of the act he committed would reasonably be able to perceive that the act was wrong.                Now, those words, written by the Arizona Court, suggested to me that, in the case of the lemon you're talking about, or in the case of the individual who thinks that the truckdriver was a Martian, they would say he does not know right from wrong, here, now, in this case.                    That, it seemed to me, is what the Court of Appeals wrote.            And if that's what they wrote, then they don't adopt the test you're attacking; rather, they do let the very evidence that you want to come in, come in, and it is totally relevant.            -- I'll go with you.    I'll say that you're absolutely right about that.                  Now, suppose, in addition, the judge did consider that.                     He did consider it, because he thought the person wouldn't know right from wrong if he thought this was an alien. All right?             A space alien.      Now, suppose that's true. Then what is the problem, from a due-process point of view?       After all, you were able to make your claim there.       The judge would have heard the evidence.               And if the judge believed that that was so, he would have acquitted the individual.            Does there remain a due- process problem?       Actually, I was --       Well, suppose --       -- I read State v. --       -- Mott --           Well, that's a different question.         If, in fact, it came in via the insanity defense, I guess the burden is on the defendant to prove it.         Is --           -- that true?         Well, if it comes in via mens rea, then the burden is on the State to disprove it.           Doesn't the State have to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, if it came in via mens rea, that the mens rea was there?           And so, the State --           -- would have to show that, in fact, he was not so insane as to preclude intent.           In the --           Yes, I -- the best I can find in that Court of Appeals opinion, at the moment, is that they do reject the idea of diminished responsibility, on Mott -- on the ground of Mott. That's true.             They say, "Don't even consider it."          But I didn't think diminished responsibility went to the question of whether he had the requisite intent.                  I thought insanity went to that, as they use those words. What is "diminished responsibility," if it isn't, "We admit the intent -- we admit that he intended to kill the individual, knew it was wrong, but he isn't as responsible as an ordinary person would be"?                What is - -           -- it, if it isn't that?       He thought he was killing another individual.       Does that --       Does the State have to -- does the Constitution have to let you off if that's the situation?       Yes, you --       All right, but --       -- but does the State have to say, "We are going to convict you of a lesser offense," in the Constitution?
05-5992 +++$+++          Yes, but on -- on that one, the -- the Second Circuit said that he was incompetent, and you could have excluded the time on (4) because (4) allows you to exclude time when he's incompetent.              And if, in fact, the district judge is sitting there thinking he's incompetent, then the failure is simply a failure to write down his reason why it's excluded.               I guess there's uncertainty here as to what reason was the district judge excluded that time, and it's a little bit hypothetical for the reason that Justice Ginsburg mentioned. But if you were to lose on the first point, then I guess on this point, the thing to do would be to send it back and determine whether, in fact, the judge intended to exclude on the ground of competency, in which case his failure was simply a failure to note down his reason, which is not required by the act.           I'm sorry.        My act must read differently.             My act says in (4), any period of delay resulting from the fact that the defendant is mentally incompetent.             It doesn't say anything about 30 days.         Yes, that's why, see, I guess on this point, we'd have to send it back because if, in fact, the judge had determined in his mind within the 30-day period that the person was incompetent or he was incompetent in fact, then that could have been his reason. I'm not sure what to do about this point in any case, and I understand that you think he wasn't incompetent, or at least it hadn't been so found.                The Second Circuit seemed to think he was incompetent because that was their basis.                So I guess if he was, it's excluded, and if he wasn't, it isn't excluded. And I don't know.           The Second Circuit said he was.        So maybe you should have another chance to argue this before the Second Circuit.         So your view is that we should say that the Second Circuit's statement that the defendant could not have been tried because, at that time, he was incompetent, that we should simply say that's false, that the Second Circuit is wrong to say that.            I'd like to know how -- how do we know that the judge didn't set forth orally his reasons for finding that the ends of justice outweigh the interest, et cetera?              Is that in the record what he actually said?         Because I don't know that you'd have to use the exact words, the ends of justice served.        You know, you don't have to -- I'd like to read what he actually said, and where -- where is that? It's not on page 192, which is somebody's opinion. But rather, if I want to read the words, where do I look?          Maybe you could say then that it's the Government that has the right.                      If it's the Government that has the right, then Government should have objected. I mean, the problem, of course, is obvious, that it's a little hard on the district judges that people come in and both sides tell them what you have to have here is a waiver.               Are you sure you won't raise this against me later?              I'm positive.         I swear.    You mean you absolutely swear a thousand times that no matter what I do and have delay, you will never raise this as an error and it's fine?                  Yes.     Okay?   So he says, okay, fine, done.              You win.       Then he raises it as an error.         That's rather -- called sandbagging the judge. And obviously, one would look to -- or I would look to ways to avoid that, but you're telling me I can't avoid it, and that's what Congress wanted and so be it.         Is that right?         How is it not correct? That's what I'm --         I'm not talking about here. I'm saying that in your -- if I adopt your position in this case, I would have to have the same position, I would think, in the most egregious cases.                  Wouldn't I? Because the only reason I'd adopt it here is because Congress wanted it no matter what.         Is that right?         Okay.      Then you're -- then am I right in characterizing?          -- until, say, the lawyers point them out.
05-608 +++$+++             Now, is -- if -- I guess there are three possible positions on the question of whether a licensee can attack a contract, a patent where he has a license and wants to keep the contract.                   One, he can never do it.   Two, he can always do it.               Three, it depends on what the contract says.        Now, do any of those questions have anything to do with the question before us, which is whether it is a case or controversy?            All right.           If we were to reach the question, which is very interesting, "What is the Government's position as to which of those three positions is the right position?" -- were we to reach it -- I agree with you, I don't see it in front of us; but maybe it is -- if it were, what would be your view?             All right.           So, basically, though, you're not certain.             The Government's view would be, it is a matter as to whether you can sue claiming the patent is invalid, whether the licensee can do it, that probably -- but you're not certain, and you haven't made up your mind definitely, because it is not in this case -- but you think it's going to be something they could regulate themselves by contract.
05-6551 +++$+++          But does it say that the only basis for a judge reasonably imposing the higher term is that the judge has found a fact that the jury didn't find.         It does say that?          As I read the California opinion, they can go up above the lower, the middle term for any reason, but it has to be reasonable.           Maybe that's hard to justify in terms of California's statute, but we take the California Supreme Court's interpretation of that statute as the law of California.       So what is the answer to my question as you read Black?           I think -- let me give you --           If that is your answer, my example will be -- I'll give you a specific example. One example is the question of consecutive versus concurrent sentences, which may have very little to do with facts. A second example might be that a judge in a particular community says there's been an unbelievable rash of breaking and entering.                  I see how the writers of this guideline, of the statute that embodies it, thought that breaking and entering was X, occurred with X frequency, but we have in this community a sudden rash of crime, such that I think the reasonable thing to do is to increase the sentence as a deterrent. Now, suppose that's what he writes.               And is there anything in California law, as you understand Black, that makes that unlawful?         What?         Which statements make that unlawful?         So in other words, when they say mandatory factor, they mean aggravating factor, they mean to exclude the kind of aggravating factor I just mentioned.         Oh, could he?              Could the judge consider the fact that I just mentioned, that there's been an extraordinary rash of breaking and entering in the vicinity?         Yes or no?         Unenumerated factors.             So mine would be an unenumerated factor.         All right.            If he can consider unenumerated factors -- now, I purposely picked mine because I take it it is an example of a factor that Apprendi would not require a jury to find. It is a factor about the community.                  It is not a factor about this defendant.              It is not a factor about the manner in which this defendant committed the crime. It is not a fact of that kind.         But if it were reasonable, it would be upheld, or not?            Well, to be quite -- to expose my thinking on it, I found it rather ambiguous, pages 1260 and 1261.   Is that what -- the first part of that is -- it says what you said.         I have no doubt.                It says just what you said. But then you get over to the part, the discussion of Booker, and when they start talking about Booker, they seem to say, seem to say, that they're adopting what Booker says.     Now, if they are adopting what Booker says, that means, and that's why I used my example, that I guess a judge would have the power, if it is reasonable, to just say the guideline, though it says thus and so, isn't right for my circumstance.                 And therefore, I don't adopt it.   And that would be reviewed for reasonableness, his decision not to follow it. And similarly, we have cases, for example, where they're trying to construct a sentence and they can't get it right because of the consecutive/concurrent nature, so he adds a few things on, you see, to the sentence, in order -- and then makes them concurrent.                       Or you could have things where it is a very sophisticated conspiracy, and the jury found the conspiracy.                   It is a characterization of a conspiracy, it is very sophisticated. And I thought, well, maybe all three of those are reasons for going up in California.                       And I read those pages, 1260, 1261, and my honest opinion is I'm not sure.           An aggravating factor means aggravating fact.         That's interesting.           Are there, in fact -- what's your estimate, guess, as to how many criminal jury-tried cases in California, what percent have two juries?      Have more than one jury?          In what percentage would you say they have bifurcated or several jury trials?                I mean, more than just one.          No, no, but how many, how many times do they -- let me call it impaneling the jury twice, or two juries, or it could be the same one.          Yes.       What percentage would you guess?     Just make a rough -- roughest conceivable guess.          So it is comparable to Booker. And then in the preceding four paragraphs, they correctly describe Booker?
05-669 +++$+++  
05-705 +++$+++         You haven't. Maybe -- if this doesn't clarify it.     I think everyone has about the same question.   You have a bunch of pay phone operators.                  And if the AT&T were charging them too much, I think everybody would say that the FCC can say, hey, that's too much.                  You owe them 2 cents a call refund, and everybody would agree that the people who are hurt could go into court and bring a lawsuit and get the 2 cents.            Right under 47 U.S.C. 201(b). Now, the only difference here seems to be that it wasn't AT&T that was charging, in my example, too much. They weren't paying what they owed.                They should have paid what they owed.      And that, says the FCC, is, under 201(b), an unreasonable practice.             And, therefore, go in and collect it in court.        Now, what is the answer to that? So far I have heard nothing that suggests that this couldn't be an unreasonable practice under 201(b), which is just what the FCC said it was.            Now, what's wrong with what I said?            I'm simply trying to focus you upon what I think is the question that's bothering some of us.        So, my answer -- not answer, but my characterization of what you have just said is that the FCC did say it was an unreasonable practice.            But in your view, it was not an unreasonable practice not to pay. And you want us to go back and second-guess, which we could, if their view of unreasonable practice is unreasonable itself.      And I guess you would have to overturn it.    I didn't know that was what the case was about, but are you saying now that that's the issue? They said it was an unreasonable practice not to pay this money, you think it is a reasonable practice not to pay the money.     There is a dispute.          That's what we should do.          Okay.        Then what should we do?          Just like AT&T when, in fact -- or any other utility that, in fact, runs into situations every day of the week, where but for an FCC regulation, they would not be overcharging, because they have a way of doing it that isn't on its face unjust.               But the FCC writes some regulations and now it is unjust.                So I guess to take that argument would overturn, I guess, about a hundred years of rate making law.             Wouldn't it?          So in other words, you are saying -- I think it is common that the FCC might write some accounting rules, for example.            And they might say, before these accounting rules, Mr. Bell's system in San Francisco, you could charge people 8 cents a call.                  But given the way we set up the accounting rules, we think this month you have to do 7 cents in the first six months, 7 cents, in the next six months, 9 cents.               And any deviation from that is unreasonable.               And the company does deviate.     I would have always thought when they do deviate, they are behaving unreasonably, and someone who pays too much could go into court and get money back. Am I wrong about that?        That's actually -- that's, I think, your strong -- to me that was the strongest argument.    When I finished reading it, I thought, well, so what.     You know, I mean, can you see why I thought that?   I mean, today's rule is different.            It is true that you don't have simply a single telephone company providing service ultimately directly to the customer. You have everything mixed up.             And there are a lot of inter-carrier things.      Language covers it.         Purpose covers it.     Facts and circumstances change.
05-7053 +++$+++ 
05-7058 +++$+++                  Probably the reason they do this is that there are lots and lots of claims by prisoners in Federal courts that are hard to decipher. They don't know what it's about.                 They don't want to put the defendant to the burden of coming in in every single complaint when it's quite a good probability it's about nothing.   That's the kind of reasoning that would lead to a rule like this.        So -- and then you have the statute and the statute says indeed there's a special power here to dismiss if it's frivolous or it doesn't state a claim or malicious. So why isn't this just an exercise of the Sixth Circuit's or a court's ordinary subsidiary rulemaking powers?      They're trying to figure out how to manage their docket.                 So your point would be that they can do this if we amend the Federal Rules.                If it's a problem take it to the Rules Committee?               Why does it hurt if you dismiss the whole thing?            They could just refile.               No.     No.       What would happen is you just dismiss the complaint. So --    I guess again the reason they have these things is they get a certain number of complaints, they have no idea what it sys, to tell you the truth, they don't know what the claim is, they don't understand it, there are a lot of things written here; the person wasn't represented; it's hard to make out.               And for, the judge thinks I have to go through all these papers; I have to figure out if there is something here that was exhausted, we know something happened; it was something exhausted -- so the simplest thing is just dismiss it. Now the prisoner can always refile it with the parts that he has to now figure out were exhausted. Now is -- and it doesn't hurt because, just refile it.              Is that true?    Or what happens?              No, well, the reason it would hurt is because it's difficult for the judge to go though this complaint that he can't quite make sense out of.   And it puts the burden of the prisoner to go through and figure out what he really wants to say. That's why -- that's why it's easier for the judge just to dismiss it than to go through many, what could be many pages with a fine-toothed comb trying to figure out if there is anything here that was exhausted.
05-746 +++$+++        As we're supposed to decide the case, in your view, there was instruction 13. Instruction 13 used the word direct.       You object to 13.         You said it should use the word in whole or in part.        You then argued to the lower courts, 13 should use the word in whole or in part.                  And then you say you've argued that here.               So what you're saying is now we're supposed to decide, should instruction 13 use the word in whole or in part. That's what it is. I have to admit, I didn't quite get that out of the blue brief.   I thought you were arguing something else about railroad negligence.          But you're not now, you say, arguing about railroad negligence.               You're arguing about plaintiff negligence.        All right.            So if I reread the blue brief, what I'll discover on closer examination, that your real objection, not responding to the other side, has simply been about the standard to use in respect to plaintiff's contributory negligence.               And what you want this Court to say is, you're right about that, we want the more relaxed standard used for contributory negligence.   End of case.        Yes?        It says that in the blue brief?       I would say it sure is before the Court, because what we are considering before the Court is your objection to instruction 13.              And you said it should use the words in whole or in part.              And I have to admit, I don't know why it shouldn't.             But I'll have to ask them that.       You're going to say yes. So all this other stuff is quite extraneous about whether -- the railroad standard of negligence, the railroad should be in a relaxed standard of negligence, in whole or in part.       Causation.       I think I'm seeing now, I think the structure of your brief is -- perhaps a gloss put on it, but saying this:       Look, we objected to the contributory negligence instruction on the ground that it couldn't be different from the direct instruction -- from the railroad instruction.        And we said they should be the same and they should both be in whole or in part.       And we now want you to say that the refusal of the court to do that was wrong, because it violated the equivalence.       But as soon as you do that, you're going to have to think about what the right standard should be for a new trial.        And if you stop there, probably, they will put the in whole or in part, but that's not the right standard.        And if you really think about it, you will see that the one we didn't ask for, but the one that the court gave, is the right standard and should have been given in the other case, too.          Now, we wouldn't have to say that.        But you're saying unless you say that, you're not going to give proper instruction to what happens in the future.     Now --        Now let's think back for a minute on the merits.        How could it be wrong?      How could it be wrong to have instructed the jury with the in whole or in part language for the railroad, since that's the language of the statute itself?       What possible -- you have two sides.     One, you write a proximate cause instruction in whatever language you like.       The other side submits a proposed instruction with in whole or in part.                 I'm a trial judge.     I've never heard of this case, kind of case before.     I just was appointed.         I read the statute.         And I say, well, here, theirs says what the statute says, and yours doesn't.     I'll play it safe.              I'll go with the statute.     All right?    Now, how could that be an error?       All right.       In other words, what the statute said it is not a correct statement of the law?
05-785 +++$+++           Why couldn't there be here?           I mean, at some point, at some point, seeing every judge in this case say this is a thoroughly -- no, let me not exaggerate.    But they say wearing buttons is a bad idea. For obvious reasons. Now, at some point, if enough judges say that, each time they say, well, it is a bad idea, but we can't say in this case that it was so prejudicial, there's that inherent risk that it's unconstitutional.                 But if some point, if people begin enough is enough to say, this is quite a bad idea to have buttons being worn in a courtroom, which is not a place for demonstration, does it not become pretty clear, irrespective of exactly what opinions say what, that this is just very unfair and unconstitutional?           Absolutely right.          Suppose you think in this Federal court, which we are, that banners, posters, and buttons are a thoroughly bad idea. Now, why?     Not just because of decorum.             But because they introduce an extraneous factor into the judgment of the jury. And suppose I also think -- I'm not saying I do, I'm trying this out -- but it is pretty hard to draw lines among buttons.         It is pretty hard to draw lines among banners.      And the only way to guarantee fair trials in whole -- is to have a wholesale rule on this.                 No buttons, no banners, no petitions, no posters. How would you explain -- you just say the law just doesn't permit that.           What do you want to say about that?   Because that is a concern I have.
05-83 +++$+++ 
05-848 +++$+++            Can I ask you about an argument I think they did make?          I think they made this argument.   On page 26 of your brief, I think it's explained well.   You set out the regs and the reg says that a major modification is "any physical change in the method of operation that would lead to a significant net emissions increase."     Then you have little (iii), which is an exception, and it excepts a physical change which leads to -- is just an increase in the hours of operation or the production rate. So that's out of it.           Now, the question is what's in it?   If that's out of it, what's in it?           I think what they've said is, if you think about that, we'll tell you what must be out of it is a physical change that does nothing to increase the capacity, but just means you can run it more hours.            And they say their proof of that is that that was the EPA's interpretation for years and years and years.          Indeed, we did what we did thinking that was it. And then after we did what we did, they pulled the rug out from under us and said no, that isn't it; now it means any physical change, like you change a nut, or a bolt, or a tube, even though there's no increased capacity to emit more.     It's just you run it more hours. Now, that they say is basically unfair, it's not what this reg has been about.           And they made that argument, according to them, very strongly and the Fourth Circuit took the argument and changed it all around and made some propositions of law that it's hard for even them to defend. All right.     Now, that's what I think, that's what I think is lying -- maybe that's lying at the heart of it.     And if it is, what do you say?
05-85 +++$+++              If in fact it goes back to the State court and you litigate it, you lost, can you raise as a point of appeal that you did not receive two things the statute guaranteed you?                  One was a determination in the Federal court that you're an organ of a Federal State, and second, a bench trial?             No, but could you?             No, I'm just asking could you, yes or no.    I --             Yes, okay.       Now if you lost in the State court, could you then use that as a basis for asking this Court to accept jurisdiction?                   And if they -- if we did, we took it and we heard the case, reverse, and send it back for the proper tribal under the statute?                 See, what I'm getting at is whenever there's an erroneous remand, the practical problems that you raise are present.                      And they're awful. I don't deny them.      I mean, they're right there in the statute, it foresees them.            So I wonder, is there any difference in this case from every case where the remand is erroneous?                 In terms of the legal right to get the trial to which the law entitles you on your view of the law, there is no difference.                 And you would get those eventually, it would just have to happen.                 One technical question. The same one.     I would to be -- imagine it is a diversity case.        Imagine that a Federal court erroneously remands it.             A trial gets up to this Court. And we say it was diverse.               It shouldn't have been remanded.     Now what's -- is that like -- can that happen?     I guess.     And is the remedy then wipe out the State proceedings, go back to Federal court?                          What happens?     Has that have ever been a case like that?                 What happened?              And it is called, the case, Missouri --
05-8794 +++$+++ 
05-8820 +++$+++                I take it you're talking about language, if I followed it, in 2244(d)(2).               And it tolled the statute while the "properly filed application for state post-conviction or other collateral review is pending." So the question is during the 90 days after they said no to you in the state court and you had a chance to file the writ, is that application pending?                 And you say yes, that application is pending, that application is pending and subject to various motions, such as a motion or a petition for certiorari.              But it is pending.              That's where we are in this argument.              Thank you.                  Does it say that?      I would have thought it said that there has to be a final judgment of the lower court, and the final judgment of the state court concerns that application which is still pending and will continue to be pending at least for 90 days in your view.                  So it doesn't require a final state application.           It requires a final judgment about the state application.
05-908 +++$+++               But I think that the point that Justice Souter is trying to make, as I understand it, is of course there are similarities to Gratz, they can choose, but there's a big difference.                 The similarity in Grutter, or the difference in Grutter and Gratz is that you had to prod a school that was supposed to be better than others, that the members of that school, the faculty and the administration tried to make it better than others.       It was an elite merit selection academy.   And if you put the black person in, the white person can't get the benefit of that. Here we have no merit selection system. Merit is not an issue.       The object of the people who run this place is not to create a school better than others, it is to equalize the schools.              That's in principle and in practice, if you look at the numbers, you see that the six schools that were at the top, their position would shift radically from year to year, preferences was about equal among them.        They have the same curriculum, they have similar faculties, and I don't think anyone can say either in theory or in practice, that one of these schools happened to be like that prize of University of Michigan, a merit selection system.                 That, I think, was a major difference that he was getting at, why is this not the same kind of thing?                 That was at issue in Grutter and Gratz.            Now what is your response to that?             I didn't say that they were.   What I said was that the object of the school board and the administering authority was to make them roughly equal.   I said that in terms of curriculum and faculty, they're about roughly equal.                   And in terms of choice, what you see is a wide variation in choice by those who want to go as to which is their preference among six schools over a period of five years. And that suggests a rough effort to create the equality, not an effort as in Michigan, to run a merit selection system.             Fine.       Now the question is, why doesn't that fact that this is not a merit selection system put a different kind of thing, a sorting system or a system designed to maintain a degree of integration, why doesn't that difference make a difference?              While you're talking about the way, let me ask a practical question.                   35 years ago in Swann, this Court said that a school board, particularly an elected one -- it didn't say that -- "could well conclude that to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting the proportion of the district as a whole."                   Far more radical than anything that's at issue here. Then it adds:           "To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities."        That's what this Court said 35 years ago.     Thousands of school districts across the country, we're told, have relied on that statement in an opinion to try to bring about a degree of integration. You can answer this in the next case if you want.                   So think about it.               My question, of course, is simply this.     When you have thousands of school districts relying on this to get a degree of integration in the United States of America, what are you telling this Court is going to happen when we start suddenly making -- departing from the case?                   Do you want us to overrule it?   Why?      Why practically?             This is the -- as I gather, the plan where race is used, has to do only with the ninth grade.   And therefore, what you would like to note is when you look at the ninth grade after they stopped using any racial criteria at all, what happened to those ninth grade classes.      Did they become more heavily separated or did they retain their diversity?                     Are the numbers that you are about to read us, which I have in front of me, going to do that?              Tell us that?         I think they're about the whole school.              The numbers I have here, Franklin went from 25 percent white to 12.7 percent. Roosevelt, which was basically a white school, jumped up from about 51 to 59.      Ballard jumped up from about 56 to 62.   Then Garfield went down some, more mixed.           But those were the worst ones; am I right on that?              Okay.
05-9222 +++$+++             When you say extra culpability, do you mean the nature of the crime? Suppose there are three crimes all committed at the same time -- murder, rape, and kidnapping. They're all very serious crimes.          And if you sentence them consecutively, you will take into account that there were three.       If you sentence them concurrently, it doesn't matter.           The Washington court says, we're not just looking to the fact that murder or rape or kidnapping are serious; we're looking to sentence consecutively if do you more than that.               You have to look to see that the kidnapping was a special kind of kidnapping.
05-9264 +++$+++             Why doesn't anybody -- you know, count.     It sounds to me if you're wondering about whether there's a specific serious risk of harm, you could find out.     Look at the conviction that in Florida for attempted burglary, look at the convictions for burglary, and see if the harm involved, the number of cases in which people are harmed is roughly similar.                We have all these law professors who like statistics.                Now they like law in economics and everything.         So why don't they go out there and count, and then we'd actually know, instead of sitting here and trying to figure out something I know nothing about.     I've never been involved in a lot of burglaries.     I don't know how the burglaries operate.                I suspect some people are hurt, but rather than my suspicion why don't we find out what the facts are?           But wouldn't it be, as a method of approaching --              Sorry, go ahead.            If we don't know and if I can't get too far with the language and I frankly could sit in my office looking at the computer screen I think for hours and I wouldn't be closer to knowing whether there is or is not a lot of injury that accompanies attempted burglary, but that is something that is possible to know.     All we have to do, as I said before, is count and there are a lot of people who can do that. In fact, there are people who at least have a mandate to do it and that is the sentencing commission.                So they have the tools.     They have the ability.             And so in the absence on a question like this of my being able to get anywhere by cogitating about the language and in a borderline case where it isn't obvious, why don't we as a Court simply follow a reasonable interpretation of what the sentencing commission did in the absence of better information from some other place?           They're trying to find out the same answer to the same kind of question:         How many of these attempted burglaries, how many burglaries, how many other crimes are accompanied by an individual being hurt?   And as I say, I cannot imagine how to answer that question in a borderline case without trying to find the numbers, which I don't have here, and therefore since I don't have them, why don't I look to the best, second best alternative, which is at least they could get them, and I hope they did get them before coming to the conclusion they did.

05-996 +++$+++             If we just could go to the merits for a second here.         You're saying this word, where it says, the word is you "may convert," and that means you can convert no matter what?             No matter what?      Okay, suppose they repeal Chapter 13 before you convert.                 Then can you convert?             I'm just producing examples where it's clear you can't convert.             Now, suppose Congress -- there is no Chapter 13.             Could you convert then?             No, okay.     Suppose he dies. Could you convert then?             Yes.   No inheritance, no nothing.             Even though there's no such person existing any more.        He's gone and his whole family is gone, and there's no inheritors, nothing. Then can he convert?    No.           I'm trying to produce ridiculous examples.      Maybe -- all right, so you say even if he's dead and there's no family he still could convert.    That's an extreme test of my hypothetical, but okay.    What about if, in fact, he goes insane?              No.           What about if, in fact, the conversion is part of a scheme to defraud millions of people in a foreign country because it will be viewed as a signal that they should mail their life savings into a particular account in Switzerland?                Can he convert then?           You say yes on that?           Even though it's going to bilk people out of millions of dollars?           No matter what?        Even if he's dead, even if he's insane?            I would have thought the answer was no, but there we are.             But there is a difference, and this is -- assume with me, which apparently you don't agree, that everywhere in law there are implied exceptions for unusual circumstances.              I have never found an instance where you couldn't think of some exception that they didn't see.             You could not bring a thing if you were insane or dead or if a death would ensue or a murder.     Assume that, all right. Then the question would be, well, what about this instance?    And I think the strongest instance -- the strongest argument for saying there's is no exception here is the argument that the trustee discovers that this individual is behaving dishonestly, that he's hidden assets.       Maybe he has a safe deposit box and he has a key and the key -- the key will allow him to get diamonds out of the safe deposit box and hide them.   Under 7, the trustee has the key.         As soon as you convert it to 13 the key is given back to the debtor, who has been shown dishonest. Now, assuming you're going to have some exceptions, why isn't that a very, very powerful one?           So is it possible if it's in 13 that then the debtor, let's say a dishonest debtor, could get back pieces of paper which would admit that debtor to the possession of certain property which he could then take and hide in a way that that couldn't happen in 7?   Is that possible or not possible?
05-998 +++$+++             As to the element, I thought that what the Ninth Circuit talked about was overt act.     They didn't use the words "overt act."            Yes, all right.   I thought that comes out of conspiracy law; it doesn't even out of attempt law.     Then I thought it's unlikely -- but here you can correct me.     The U.S. Code is filled with the word "attempt."     Just opening it at random, there are attempts to assault and steal mail matter, there are attempts to steal the mail matter, there are attempts to rob a bank, attempts here, attempts there. Is it the Government's practice whenever they charge a violation of any of these provisions to not just use the word "attempt," but to use the words "substantial step"?            I would have thought the answer was no.     And therefore, this isn't just a small error of a technical sort.         The Ninth Circuit is completely wrong and not even close.               And therefore, if they're not even close, can the Government come up here where there's an obvious error and they decide, the Government, that it would like to have a declaration by this Court on a matter that they think is quite interesting and important to them in a lot of other cases where they can't win the cases easily? That's, I'm putting it a little pejoratively because I'm trying to get you to see what I'm driving at.     It's like a hoked-up case.          Why not?   I'm using it pejoratively only so that you can see what I'm worried about.           Does this come up very often?   I think the case -- the issue you want to raise, because I would think normally there's a motion before the trial, well before the jury is empanelled.          The defendant says:   I want you to dismiss this; the indictment's inadequate.      And if that's even close, I would think normally the prosecutor would go back and say:   Fine, I'll get a superseding indictment, and that would end the problem.     And it seems to me so likely to happen that the chances of the judge wrongly ruling against the defendant and then it goes through a whole trial almost never happens.            Doesn't an indictment have as its purpose in part to tell the defendant what crime he's being accused of committing?             Isn't that -- so that's why I thought it would be quite clear, wouldn't it, or helpful to say that to the Ninth Circuit?               And so an error is when it doesn't do that?               And an error is when it leaves out an element, and he doesn't know what crime is being committed, he's accused of.               So suppose you had an indictment that really did that.               Now he doesn't know what crime he's accused of.              And then you go to the trial and so forth and now we have to go into at what point did he work out what crime he was being accused of, rather hard to say.            Well, yes, of course the chances are.     But there's a possibility he didn't.            So if he didn't and therefore the indictment was faulty in that respect, then what?     Are you going to say we have to track down -- I mean what it's reminding me of is like trying to say whether he got an adequate lawyer, didn't get an adequate lawyer, who knows, that kind of problem.           -- me until halfway through the trial that it was robbery I was being accused of because they left robbery out of the indictment.
06-1005 +++$+++              I've got that point, but what is your suggestion as to how to deal with what is underlying disturbing me and it seems like a lot of others, if prima facie Congress did not intend that you launder money where the activity is an essential part of the underlying crime itself?           And there are three ways of dealing with that: One is this gross receipts method, which has the defects you mentioned. The second is a definition of "promotion" which says when you promote a crime that's different from engaging in the crime. And the third is sentencing; because it's a real offense sentencing method and where what you've done is nothing more than the underlying crime, the sentence should be nothing more than the underlying crime.     I see three ways to get to the same problem, and you're asking us to decide them piecemeal, yet they're related.     What do I do?             But still your answer leaves me -- and I have no answer to this; I want yours. I want you to see that I'm in -- at risk here as a judge of getting whipsawed, that I first decide this case for you; and the next case, all kinds of arguments appear that I hadn't thought of; and then the third case, again.   But if I could have them somehow together, I could look at the least evil way or the most efficient way of achieving the congressional objective.              I have it in front of me actually.   I was looking at it.             And it seems to me what it assumes is that the underlying offense is different from the money laundering.          And do you have any rationale at all as to why this individual, if it's true that he did nothing more than engage in the underlying offense, why should he receive one day more than 60 months?
06-10119 +++$+++                 So I think you have two instances here.   One is Mrs. Scott, and the other is Mr. Brooks.   And with regard to Mr. Brooks, what I've read in the transcript is that he was nervous and unhappy, because he's learning to be a teacher, and he's afraid he's going to miss some student teaching time which will count against him.
06-102 +++$+++  
06-1037 +++$+++                I guess the part that they are saying is arbitrary as I understand it, and I appreciate your correcting me if I don't understand it correctly, is that you get double your pension at 55 if you've worked 20 years as opposed to 10.               Is that right?               A worker who has been there, he's qualified, he has only worked for 10 years and now he's 55 years old.         There is a chart in the SG's brief, and as I read that chart, he got amount "X".                  He started at 45, he ended up at 55, he gets "X".               If he started at 35 and worked for 20 years, he would get much more than "X".               You would get "Y", because he worked for 20 years rather than 10; is that right? I'm not talking about a disabled person.               I'm talking about anybody.              So if a person works for 20 years, he gets more than if he worked for 10 years; is that right?              Now he is disabled.    And when he's disabled, if he's disabled after working only 10 and he is 45 years old, they pretend he had worked the full 20?              Now I understand it. Now, this individual says, I was working there after the age of 55, I only worked for 14 years, now I become disabled.        If I become disabled before I was 55, let's say I had six years to go, they would give me six years extra.      But because I was disabled after I'm 55, I get nothing extra.              Nothing is imputed.   Is that right?               I didn't ask you for the reasons.   I want to know if I'm factually right.               Where am I factually wrong?               You're giving me reasons. I'll ask you in a second for the reasons.                    I want to know if what I said is factually true?               And not after?               Okay.      Now I'll say that I think is the discrimination of which he is complaining. And now what he would like to know is what possible reason is there for that difference?                    Now I'd like to hear what the reason is that justifies that difference. You give him six extra years when he retired after 14 years and though he was only 49 years old, and you don't give him even one extra year when everything else was the same but he retired after he was 55. Now, explain to me what the reason is for that.              No.    He says now, what he says to that, I take it, is fine.                 He is 49 years old. He has six years to go to qualify for retirement, so let him retire.    If you let him retire, and you gave him 14 years of credit, you would be treating him just like you're treating me. But in addition to letting him retire, you give him six extra years of credit, which at two and-a-half percent per year.            Good, I'm glad you do that.   Give me the six extra years at two and-a-half percent as well.   Treat us alike. What's your response?              But that's the point, right?              There -- that's what the complaint is, I think, that you say it's the second part that you just said.      What you do when the person is disabled and he is not yet 55 -- he hasn't qualified yet -- is you both qualify him, and when you qualify him you give him credit for years he hasn't worked.               Now, the older person who is still working and is also disabled says:    Fine, you let me retire, but you don't give me any extra years. Now that's the complaint, I think.                So that if you had a person who had started at 45, eligible to retire at 55, works for 4 years and becomes disabled, he is credited with 14 years; while the person who started at 35 and at 45 becomes disabled, he is given 20 years. He is given the 10 extra years.               So the first person, older person, says:      You gave him some extra years; you didn't have to give him those extra years in order to qualify him to retire.        You could have just said you can retire, but you gave him 10 extra years and you give me no extra years.   Why not?              You don't need anything to bring you to normal retirement.                You could rewrite the plan and say when a person becomes disabled you get retirement, right at that moment.                  You could say that. And what the plaintiff is saying is, why don't you say that?     Though it's a bit mean.             But I think what he would probably like is you would extend the extra years to him.              See, that's why I think the result in this case is just terrible.                     I think it takes disabled people and cuts their benefits with no benefit. I cannot believe for two minutes that Congress would have intended that result.            But the reason I asked you the question was I want you to tell me how to get to that result under this statute.
06-1082 +++$+++               Did you -- excuse me, sorry, General.
06-11206 +++$+++ 
06-11429 +++$+++               Is the following true, that if you are right the reason Congress passed this new definition was it wanted to take those handful of States which have felonies as a year, the ones Justice Alito is talking about, and make clear that they are not covered?              All right.       But if the government's right, then the reason Congress did this is that it recognized what I think is the truth, that felonies and misdemeanors are defined differently in many different ways under the laws of many different States and, in a matter where so much prison time turns on it, wished to create a single, uniform definition. Now, if that's right, I'm asking myself which is a more plausible purpose.              No, it doesn't, because if you're right, then you first have to look to the patchwork quilt of laws in all the different States to see whether those different States define the conduct as misdemeanors or felonies.          And then, having solved the patchwork problem, we add on the requirement of one year.   And so the bite of the new definition would be what Justice Alito said and nothing else. Now, that's -- and, yet, on the government's interpretation, the bite is to create a single, readily applied, uniform rule. Now, if I ask myself which of those is most plausible, I hate to tell you which answer I get.               Am I right?        Am I right?     I mean, I put that out to give you a chance to say.                  I'm not sure I am right.
06-11543 +++$+++                If you're quoting that, then this is what's now bothering me.                    I'm not saying I have an answer one way or the other. Let's take two crimes and imagine that the same number of people injured or killed is identical for the two.   One let's say is burglary and the other is driving under the influence.            Now, let's imagine exactly the same number are put at risk, exactly the same number hurt, exactly the same number killed. When I wrote that opinion, it seemed to me that there still is an important difference between the two crimes that is controlling here.                    But if you look at what I wrote, I didn't articulate that difference very well.   So I would like you to tell me what I should have said in order to have said very clearly just what that intuitive difference was.
06-116 +++$+++              I have a question, if I can, if we should reach the merits of the case --             I know that.     That isn't it.   I have a question about -- I have a question about the merits.             I know, but I have a question I'd like you to go into.             I looked up, my law clerk has, and found eight States that seem roughly comparable.    Those that go to assessed value, every single one of them -- and most of them do -- they have the word like "assessment.           The only comparable places we found are Puerto Rico, Philippines in 1916, and Guam here which don't use the word "assessment," but use the words "aggregate taxable value." All right.      Now, what's happened in those places?   We know what's happening in Guam.                     I can't -- with the Philippines in 1916 and Puerto Rico, there ought to be some experience there even if we couldn't find a case how they treated it.             Try Utah, try Iowa.     Try --              My question is the following.   In Puerto Rico and in the Philippines after 1916, and in Alaska, were there any instances in which they issued bonds that exceeded the 10 percent of the assessed value as opposed to the aggregate market value? They either did or didn't and that shouldn't be hard to find out.                There are big lenders in the United States and those people don't fool around. They get opinions.      And they lend money to Puerto Rico or they lend money to some of these places.                      They're going to have opinion letters.                And those opinion letters are going to say whether they think in their opinion this is over reaching to many bonds or not.                        And Of course, I would think those opinion letters would say for Puerto Rico, what the words aggregate tax valuation mean.   They might or might not. In other words, I'm trying to find ways of getting the tax.
06-11612 +++$+++  
06-1164 +++$+++               How do you suggest we write the opinion?     If you were writing it and then a dissent, say, or someone or we read in the briefs that here is an absolute holding of the Supreme Court right on point, totally clear, says just exactly what the government says here, and it was codified in 1948, and now we say the reason, despite that, you win is?              And if somebody says, well, the Court couldn't have been clearer as to what the statute meant, and Congress reenacted it in codifying it.   So what do you want?              I mean, what could be clearer?   Are they supposed to actually -- in the recodification in 19 -- or is it that the recodification changed things or what?              But even all those cases which you're going back to, what you're talking about, I think, in those cases is general statements in the case. The cases themselves, except possibly for that Franconia, which has a different problem because it was about accrual, the cases themselves don't involve this statute.    It's simply general statements.                  I thought, and I'd like your response, that in this Court's opinion as in statutes, as in life.             When people make general statements, they don't mean every possible situation in the universe; rather, there are always circumstances to which the statement doesn't apply.                  And so why don't we just read those statements as incorporating a prior explicit holding of the Court as inapplicable to that prior explicit holding?         I mean, that's what you'd normally do with a sentence like that, isn't it?
06-1181 +++$+++                  Is there appeal?       I mean, what happens?     They file a motion to reopen, denied. Now, can they appeal that?                 Okay.       And how much time does that take?             Right.           But how -- do they then appeal the motion to -- they appeal the motion -- the denial of the motion to reopen or how long -- where do they go?    Do they have -- this is the Board, so they go right to the court of appeals?             And how long do those take on average?             I'm not interested in the problem.    I'm interested in how much added time it actually means.    So let's go -- if you win, how much additional time in a typical case would the alien have before he has to leave?             And then, and then do you in addition ask for cert or is it not in addition?                     Are you including that within the 13 months?                 Or would you just guess on the basis of your experience?               I'm not holding you to it.                 All right.       What I'm wondering here, and this is because I see two contrary things, if for to you win it means that you are adding an average of, say, 400 days to a stay where Congress said we want you to stay no more than 60 days or 120? That's pretty hard for me to reconcile, to tell you the truth.              Well then, that's the answer to my question.
06-1195 +++$+++                 Going back to Justice Scalia's question on the precedent, suppose -- and I'm going to be -- I'd like my mind to be clear on this.   I thought that the question asked was for you to find an instance where there was no sovereignty of the country and they issued the writ, and it was turning on a technical thing.      Whether that was how the question was met or not, what I read here in these different briefs is in 1759, Lord Mansfield, the case can issue -- a writ of habeas corpus, no doubt the power could issue it where the place is under the subjection of the crown of England.    Then Lord Sellers in Mwenya said subjection is fully appropriate to the powers, that's habeas, irrespective of territorial sovereignty or dominion, in other words, non-technical. In our case in Rasul, both the concurring opinion and the majority opinion say things like the reach of the writ depends not on formal notions of territorial sovereignty, but on the practical questions. Then they both list practical questions. Now suppose we take that as the definition. Now, can you find instances where the writ has been issued by Britain in history to people who were not citizens and who were not actually held in Britain?             They are --               The Spanish doctor, the Swedish doctor, the Spanish sailors, the British spy, they're all in this case.

06-1221 +++$+++                If that's the way to do it, you didn't do it that way, did you?                      I mean, as I read it -- they put in here, on 163a, the motion that you made to the district court said that you have to be "similarly situated" -- "Plaintiff has to have been 'similarly situated' with other employees" -- and you put that in quotes -- "similarly situated."                     And then you say "employees may be 'similarly situated' only if they have the same supervisor."               Period.        Not -- it wasn't a period actually, but the rest of the sentence isn't important.    And then you cite Aramburu, which is where the Tenth Circuit said that. So I don't see how you can say this wasn't a 401 case.   You were saying that weren't similarly situated, period.     And then the district judge virtually quoted those words.              Well, that may be, but the -- I don't see -- I mean, that may be, but this is the argument you made, and this was the argument the district judge adopted.        Is that not so or is it so?              That's why I don't understand your answer.          I'm confused here.               What I said, and you seemed to agree, is different from what was just said, which you also seemed to agree. (Laughter.) I thought that you said in your brief that you have to have been -- quote -- "similarly situated." All right?     "Employees must be similarly situated to Plaintiff."     That's true, isn't it?                    I'm quoting the brief, from page 163.        And then you say, "Employees may be similarly situated only if they have the same supervisor." Then the district court says that plaintiff may offer evidence who are "similarly situated" to her and then -- quote -- "similarly situated employees" -- quote -- "for the purpose of this ruling requires proof that Paul Reddick, his supervisor, was the decisionmaker."    That's why I thought it was fairly clear, since he used the same words and substituted the word "Paul Reddick" for the same supervisor, that he was taking that right from your brief where you made that general argument and said nothing about the particular case in those sentences.              How could ut have been? What about the date problem he just mentioned?             You said -- your opponent said that when you filed this motion in limine on December 15, 2004, by that time, there hadn't been any fact-specific things at all brought up in the trial that were relevant to this, and there's certainly none in the notion that I could see.              But where does it say?      I can't find in the motion, although there is something on disparate impact, anything that says well, you see, I don't know about the general mine run of cases, but in this particular case, it's not sufficiently material, it is a waste -- it's not -- it is a waste of time.                Now, I just can't find that.               Did anyone argue that before December 15, 2004, that we don't know about the mine run of cases, but this case, in fact it's a waste of time?   Did anyone argue that before December 15, 2004?               I'm asking yes or no; did they or didn't they?               Okay.
06-1249 +++$+++              Why isn't -- why isn't the fact that some certain number of people are getting gangrene, why isn't that new information?             That was all passed long after the events here took place, I think.             So at the time, you read the regulation, I think a person would think that he was free drug manufacturer if he learned something new to strengthen -- strengthens the contraindication, put it in.               Why wouldn't that be new?               If you get a certain number of cases.               That's because nobody brought up this new information point.                    So if nobody brought up the new information point at the trial and if the burden is on the manufacturer to show that it's pre-empted, isn't that the manufacturer's fault, because if you simply read the regulation, you wouldn't find any of all this complicated stuff about certain kinds of new information.               Yes it's a legal question.               But we are not making an advisory opinion.    We are deciding this case.              And this case here you say new information of a certain kind would be okay, nobody argued it.                You read the reg, and it doesn't seem to make all these distinctions end of case.   Since the manufacturer has the burden of going into this, which apparently it didn't do.                So, now we have decided this case, and we go on to the next one.               What's your response to that?
06-1286 +++$+++              I've read the legislative history, which shows to me, anyway, precisely no light whatsoever.    It's -- the only relevant sentence, which is the third sentence, simply repeats the statute.                    And, therefore, I thought that what Congress is trying to do is say, treat trusts like individuals, except in respect to special expenses. What are special expenses?                 Those that are related to the trust and that an individual wouldn't have occurred -- incurred.           I can't say it much clearly than that.    But I have an absolutely clear idea what it means.    To me it means that if this is an expense that the trust is saying is special, I would say, would a reasonable person who did not hold these assets in trust, would such a person be likely to make that kind of expenditure? And if the answer to that question is yes, well, then I would say it's not a special expense.                    And if the answer is no, I would say it was. And then the IRS and you will come and say that isn't precise enough.           And I'd say the IRS has plenty of authority in its regs to give lists of examples which they do in such instances. Now, I'm posing that, not because I bought into it, though I'm tempted to, but I'd like to know what your response is.              There's nothing that I could find anywhere that talked about pass-throughs in respect to the special situation of trusts and estates. In the first sentence it speaks to it in respect to individuals.     It all makes sense.               And what they seem to be saying is just what I said initially.                      We do agree trusts do have a special claim, but only in respect to special trust expenses.          And which are they?              They're the ones an individual wouldn't have incurred. And I'll put a gloss on it, like we do in law.     I say a reasonable individual.                   I say wouldn't reasonably have incurred.            And then I leave it up to the IRS to say which are the expenses that an individual would likely incur and which ones he wouldn't likely incur. Now, that runs throughout tax law, doesn't it, that kind of list, what's a necessary expenditure, what isn't.     I mean, they do that all the time, don't they?              Not buying into they're thing with "could."       I mean, that isn't my problem.
06-1287 +++$+++ 
06-1321 +++$+++               The answer is that it doesn't exclude them, that they have all these collective bargaining rights; they have the civil service rights; they can go and bring their same claim with other remedies.        You could make the opposite claim: Why should they have two rights?                 Everybody else has one.     I mean, that seems to me what they're argument is underlying this. Then when you go to Title VII -- and this I don't understand fully.          Look at Title VII and Title VII in 16(e) has a basic ban.            Is that right?              And then, in 16(d) it says certain of those things govern Federal suits, suits against the Federal Government.                Then it incorporates some provisions.     And it says that you get that certain relief against the Federal Government where there is discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.       Then it says "or in violation of 3(a)."     And then 3(a) refers to retaliation. So it looks like Title VII does give you a remedy, in 3(a), for retaliation.                  And it's rather specific, and that suggests that those other words don't pick up retaliation.     It's rather that specific thing. Now, what have I missed?              Well, you could say that, but you could also say, well, look here in Title VII Congress has some words, and these words give you a specific -- if you're a Federal employee and somebody's retaliating against you because you went and complained about race or something, just read those words; you can bring a lawsuit, right?       Am I right about that?              No?              You go to the EEOC?              Well, I'm not totally certain what I'm talking about either.                  So we could go on. (Laughter.)              Or in violation of --               Well, could you proceed with that?     That is, a very simple way of thinking of this as one possible way of reading it is that Congress says:   When private employers discriminate, there can be whistleblower's, and they need protection; so let's put some in.     When State officials discriminate, say, on the basis of race, there can be some whistleblower's.                 Maybe they protect them in some States; maybe they don't protect them in others.          We better put some in.         When Federal Government officials discriminate against on the basis of race, whistleblower's should be protected. But we have a whole system here to protect them.     And so let's just use that system and treat all whistleblower's alike, and that's the end of the matter. We don't need any special protection for whistleblower's here. Now, the answer to that is what?             Who -- who is such a person?             Why can't they -- why can't they go to like the Merit System Protection Board?                So they are outside the Civil Service, and they don't have unions?                They don't have a union?                So they could be fired for anything.
06-1322 +++$+++              But if they do that why can't -- and you don't -- if they don't give you the notice, well, then you can complain, they didn't give us the notice.             But if you're not hurt by it, what difference does it make?             And if you don't get it, you can't complain, if you actually knew about it.             If you didn't know about it, then -- then you have a complaint.             Well -- well, then you'd have the complaint if you didn't, et cetera, but so what?   In other words, if the EEOC wants to have a very broad definition that turns 90 percent of its -- whatever this thing is called, the statement -- I forgotten the name, sorry.            What's the name of this document?   The intake questionnaire.                Yes.      If it has a broad definition that says this counts as a charge, so what? Let it do it.     Who's hurt?                And if they don't, you complain about that.                You complain just as you're doing now, in court.        You just the same words, but instead of using the words as against the word "charge," you use those same words you've all said in your excellent arguments, except you attack the fact you didn't get the notice, and there you're really hurt.                     Or if you're not, it doesn't matter.                Well, all right.       So what's wrong with that?
06-134 +++$+++                  What was your distinction between a mortgage and a tax lien?               Well, so think they can't enforce mortgage under this?             That is to say the bank can't; it's not an interest of property in mortgage?               That's, that's where it's hard for me because a purchase money mortgage, you sell the real estate.   Ordinary secured interest in mortgage is secured interest by a lender is normally viewed as an interest in property, I think.              I mean is there, is there any law anywhere that says that isn't an interest in property?              But I take it there has never been a case in the history of the world you'll tell me where a lender or bank or anybody who loaned money to build an embassy has ever brought a case against the owner of the embassy, the sovereign, and won under anything like this exception, because they can't sue them.              Ever.       And there is none the other way, where they said you couldn't sue them.              Okay.       So why do people lend money to build embassies?             And how did it work before 1605 was passed, how did they used to build, in the 19th century, embassies, if you know.              What about paragraph 3 just after paragraph 2 in the complaint?                       Paragraph 3 asks the court to bar and forever foreclose the defendants from all right, interest, claim, etcetera in the parcel. Well, what about that?         What they're asking, I just heard it.     So what's the answer to that?                   They seem to be saying, we have the right to the parcel, you the defendant have no right to the parcel.              Well, I did in part, so he can answer.
06-1413 +++$+++                Am I thinking about that part correctly?   I -- I found this difficult.             I go back to the railroad; that seems the easiest case.              You have a railroad in 50 States, and Illinois finds it very hard to evaluate its -- evaluate its value, its railroad property in Illinois, because the value of that depends on service everywhere.       So the court says that's the unitary principle; and really what you're supposed to look at is whether when you look at the supposedly separate part of the business, does that separate part of the business contribute to the whole thing?              So that if you were in fact trying to say what is Illinois doing without considering that separate part, it would be tough to do. I mean, that's the underlying theme.              And if that's so, there is no second test.    I mean, I grant you there is language, but really what people have done is they've said, we are here in a special situation because we have an interest in another company, and that's a special part of our business, and has nothing to do with the rest of the business.   And then the argument is no, it does have something to do with the rest of the business.             And if it does, like it provides you with working capital, it's just like the railroad track in California vis-a-vis Illinois.              And if it doesn't, it doesn't.    So now, if that's right, then it's the form of analysis rather than the result that's wrong in the court below.    Because they start talking about two separate tests and then people argue whether the second should swallow up the first, and at that point I get totally lost.    It's fairly long, but I'd appreciate your evaluating what I've just said.
06-1431 +++$+++              What happens in just a basic employment case?        I'm trying to remember from law school.   Somebody's contract with another man, he's the employee, and he says -- the employer says:               I'm firing you because you won't help me rob the bank.               Or the employee goes and he finds some money in a wallet or something on the street, and he says, I'm going to return it to the rightful owner, and the employer says, I hate rightful owners, so I'm firing you.               Now, when the employee goes to court, I take it -- my vague recollection is the employer can't do that.             The State law, is there some kind of policy against that from the State law, he couldn't do it?             Well, here we have a Federal statute that says that a black person shall have the same right to make a contract as a white person. But if nobody ever can report on that, that they're not, it's not going to be the same right; it's going to be zero right.    So, why by parity of reasoning wouldn't this provide for the same kind of thing?               Oh, no.          It would make no difference whether you're a thief in my example, whether you're good-hearted.      It doesn't matter who you are. You could even be somebody from another country.                    You don't have to be American.          You could be anything.            But the State law tries to follow out that -- that policy of not having bank robberies and of returning money to rightful owners. Well, here we have a Federal policy, and the Federal policy is that black people shall be treated the same as white in respect to making a contract.                   But were the law to allow you to fire anybody who complained about it, then black people wouldn't have that right. And therefore the policy is that you can't do it under this statute because otherwise the written policy is ineffective. I'm just remembering that from my written -- from my policy arguments that were in contract law.               Does it say anywhere, by the way, in that statute that a black person who is discriminated against can go to court and file a lawsuit?                Does it say that?                Yes.      Does it say is in that statute, 1981?                Yes, correct.                No.     Okay.                And have we developed a policy here in creating a right of action under this 1981?             Which is the statute that does -- is there a statute that specifically gives you a right to sue under 1981?         Is there a statute?             It has established it. Yes, that's my point:      That the Federal court implied from the statute a right of action. Now, if they're implying a right of action from the statute, why wouldn't courts also imply those rights of action necessary to make the statute effective?             That isn't the word I was looking for.   The word I was looking for in 1981(a) is the word "and can bring a lawsuit in Federal court."               I don't see that written there.               No, correct.     So we've implied that.   And therefore, if I can imply that, why can't we imply a lawsuit on behalf of those who need the lawsuit to make the right effective?               That was my basic question.                Why not?         Because the legislative history does say, when they passed this, that the new law will involve a claim, allow them to make a claim of harassment, discharge, promotion, transfer, retaliation, and hiring.                So when they write that in the House report, isn't that some evidence that they did look back and see Sullivan, and they did think that in 1982 there's a retaliation action, and therefore in 1981 there is one?   Isn't there at least evidence that there were people in Congress thinking that?                And that someone --             Well, I think we're familiar with that debate.           But if we can look -- look at the statute, if I ask you why isn't this an enjoyment of a benefit, a privilege or term or a condition of the contract, is your answer that this was an at-will contract?              All right.              All right, because I don't think that's is a good argument.              Why isn't this a benefit or a privilege that's been denied?
06-1456 +++$+++                Maybe I should ask you this now because you've probably thought about it and I can't work it out.     I don't see any problem with the word "location."     I thought what you would say is it isn't the transportation in this instance that concealed the location, it's the method of transportation that sealed the location.               And if you read it that literally, then there is no problem in getting to your interpretation of the statute, or is there?                 Because since you didn't advance that argument, I thought maybe there's something I've not seen here.              I still don't see why isn't what the Chief Justice said absolutely right?              If you are transporting this money to get it out of town so the police can't find it, you're transporting it to conceal it.   That falls right within the statute.              If you're transporting it simply to pay some courier somewhere else, you're not transporting it to conceal it.              And if in fact the transportation is done in a way that conceals it, that's beside the point because the statute is interested in transporting it in order to conceal it.             What is wrong with that?
06-1457 +++$+++  
06-1463 +++$+++               What is it -- I should know this, but I don't.      Imagine that Jones and Smith, civil engineers, builders, enter into a contract.                     They have an arbitration provision suspiciously like this one.                        It says we promise to arbitrate everything, any dispute, including a dispute about whether this agreement is legal or not itself.        They have that.               They go to the arbitrator. Jones says:        You know, Mr. Arbitrator, you don't know that much about civil engineering, but there's a judge here who does.                So I think what I'm going to do tomorrow is file a lawsuit in the superior court in California making the same claims I'm making here and maybe that judge will decide it first and then you'll be really helped.           Now what stops him from doing that in the law?               The Federal -- the Federal Arbitration Act says what that makes it clear he can't do that?               I mean, I grant you if he can do it you might as well tear up the Federal Arbitration Act and throw it out the window.            But I just want to know what is it in the law specifically that stops him from doing that.               So even though it's not --              Well, but that -- that's what I'm driving at, and I think that's interesting, that there's an implicit -- because it doesn't say it explicitly -- there's an implicit promise not to undermine this contract by running off to court.              All right.       And so you can't -- no case comes to your mind where anybody has tried that little end run?         And --              I agree, I don't see how they could, but I just want to get to the bottom of it.             Okay.              Regardless of the -- I now understand better than I did what I take as a pretty strong argument.    I'm not saying convincing, but strong. And that would be this:                     If you go look at Volt, and in Volt the Court said that the California Code meant that the individual who'd entered into the arbitration contract could go and can ask a superior court to stay an arbitration while some unrelated -- some unrelated -- I mean directly related but not the same parties -- litigation took place. The Court didn't in Volt say that that question of interpreting this contract is for the arbitrator.    I don't know why it didn't.                     But it didn't. Now here he's making a parallel argument. He's saying that the California Code says that people should first go to that Labor Commissioner and that you can stay arbitration while that goes on. Now -- and I say well, why don't you go to the arbitrator?     He says I don't want to go to the arbitrator on that one, but he points to Volt. And so the puzzle is this:                     if the Court in Volt didn't say this is a matter for the arbitrator, whether the contract really means that you promise not to go into court and make a motion to stay, why here is it a matter for the arbitrator whether you implicitly promised not to go into court and asked him to stay pending the outcome of this administrative proceeding? What do you think about that?              Well, I -- I accept that. I see a lot of common sense on your side of it.              But imagine I'm writing an opinion in your favor and now I come to the following paragraph which I have to write: "Your opponent says that Volt controls here; but that is wrong because" -- and now fill in the blank for me.              Now, I'm just saying I have to write.     I see all the common sense of your position. I -- absolutely.     But to get -- you only need one really good argument.     And he's saying whatever the other ones are, here Breyer or somebody is going to have to write the words, and Volt is different because -- so I would like some help on that one.
06-1498 +++$+++               Let's just say you use something like primary jurisdiction said that they actually have to -- to withdraw it.                     Now, if the FDA -- this is what Justice Stevens said in his concurring opinion, which I thought had a lot to be said for it -- that if you had a system where the FDA did withdraw it and found fraud, you could ask them, and then nothing wrong with the plaintiff going ahead there.              You don't have any problem.              That's not --

06-1509 +++$+++               But those are different. Those are whether that's a corporate purpose.                   I think the question here is, as I started, I thought that this expert was going to testify that there were no earnings and profits in the relevant year.               Having read it more closely, it seems to me that that is not what the expert is going to testify.      Rather, he's going to say if there were no earnings and profits, then it is a return of capital if the basis is high enough.                   He's going to testify to that legal proposition. So, my question is, is there any proffer of evidence here where the taxpayer says I want a chance to show there were no earnings or profits?              Where is it?              So what did happen there? I've been looking at page 62 through 66.                     They are dancing around the issue.          It's fair to say that they wouldn't be having these four pages unless they are thinking of return of capital as a defense, but they don't actually say it.              They would have raised it.
06-157 +++$+++               I don't understand.       I'm back -- I really -- I'm surprised.                 And it's probably my fault.   But that I thought -- I started where Justice Scalia was with his first question.                I thought this had something to do with whether Congress passed a statute or the President acted on his own.                But listening to you now I think, I can't decide -- I think you have a different argument. Suppose -- I'm just trying to understand. Suppose that Congress passes a law and it says it's a very nice thing to commemorate the Pilgrims by building a Government church at Plymouth Rock, where we will have the regular worship in the Puritan religion.                 Now can a taxpayer from California in your view challenge that?              Yes, but --             Why not?          Because I thought Flast made clear that they could.             Then you go to a private group?             All over America, they build churches dedicated to one religion; and Congress passes a statute and says in every city, town, and hamlet, we are going to have a minister, a Government minister, a Government church, and dedicated to the proposition that this particular sect is the true sect; and they pass a statute like that, nobody could challenge it?             Is that what you're saying, then?             I don't know, I mean --             -- everybody else who doesn't want to go just avoids it.                 So that they don't have to do anything.      They just have to --                 Who?      Who?                 Maybe they don't walk into it because it is not "our church."                   So they don't walk into it.                 And moreover, they don't -- they don't feel it's discriminatory.                      It's just we're doing this to commemorate the Pilgrims, and we'll give the money to any group that's a Pilgrim. (Laughter.)              So what's wrong with just saying that Flast stands for the proposition that when the Government spends money in violation of the establishment clause, a taxpayer -- after all, the money comes from the taxpayer -- can bring a lawsuit?                 And the reason that they do that is because the establishment clause is an important joint part of the religion clauses; and there'd be no other way to bring such a challenge.   And sometimes it's that simple principle, and when we depart from that principle, say by giving property away instead of giving money away, you don't have the standing.      So we have a pretty clear, simple rule.   That rule applies whether it's Congress or the President acting under congressional authority, et cetera, which I think is close to what the other side --               Because there is a real case or controversy, because people become terribly upset when they see some other religion getting the money from the State for the -- for building a church, for example, and that's why:           There's a real controversy.              It is the kind of upset that is a genuine injury if you look to the objectives of the establishment clause and possibly that kind of genuine injury is not the case when you look to objectives of various other clauses of the Constitution.              That's what I was saying. I said that Flast then encapsulates that principle drawn out of the objectives of the establishment clause in a rule; and the rule is what I suggested.              Based on money.
06-1595 +++$+++                Why don't you follow what the EEOC says?   I mean, the EEOC, as I understand it, has said the very fact the employer has initiated an investigation of an alleged discrimination is sufficient to demonstrate the reasonableness of the employee's belief that by providing information relevant to the inquiry she is opposing an employment practice made unlawful by Title VII. And then they go on.                To be absolutely clear about it, they say an employee who assists her or her employer in the endeavor, i.e., you go and testify; so the sun was shining on that day; you are assisting your employee by telling the truth-- is by definition -- is opposing practices made unlawful by Title VII. So here we have a difficult question, quite an interstitial question, defining precisely "opposing," and here we have the EEOC doing it.                     So why don't we just follow what they say?              Is this a real problem?            I mean, let's suppose the opposition clause protects everybody in the internal investigation who could be at all interpreted as favorable to the complainant.                        It also protects everybody who could possibly be viewed as neutral. Then you have a problem about what about a person who loves sexual harassment?                     This is the hypothetical:   he comes in, testifies:                    I love sexual harassment; it's wonderful, and they fire him.                        Now is this a real problem?             The problem with that is that I -- while I have the EEOC with me, say, on -- assuming your thing -- on, from what I read, on the opposition clause, when I looked into what the EEOC actually said here on the participation clause, I don't think I can characterize it, except for their litigation position.             I can't characterize what they've said in their compliance manual as being with you on that.              And they could easily change it.    They could easily change it.              Yes.      It's not in their manual.
06-1646 +++$+++ 
06-1666 +++$+++               One more -- I'd like -- on the first question, in reading through this, my impression was that the government -- and the green briefs, you know, the dark green briefs against you from the Military Justice Institute and the national security specialists really don't disagree.                That is that everybody seems to agree, to use the words General Casey said, that U.S. soldiers in Iraq are subject to the authority, direction, and control of the commander of the U.S. Central Command.         And you say in your brief that really this multilateral force operates subject to a unified American command, and the chain of command ultimately runs to the President.               So as a practical matter it's the President and the Pentagon, the Secretary of Defense, and the American commanders that control what our American soldiers do. I take it there's agreement on that point, but where there's disagreement is that you say, well, the same was true with that tribunal at issue in Hirota. Am I right about that?              Yes.     So we're not -- we're not -- I take its you say that, as a practical matter and as a matter of the chain of command, it runs through American officers to American commanders to the Secretary of Defense to the President of the United States.   There is no disagreement about that, or is there?               There is not.               Yes.     Okay.       Then if there is not -- if there is not, am I right in thinking the issue is whether, because the words -- there's some connection with foreign governments, absolutely. There's some, but it doesn't interfere with that chain of command.   And now your point is:                      But the same was true with the tribunal at issue in Hirota.               Yes, yes.               The same was true.          It was General MACArthur.               Well --               But that's because the President, I take it, would follow what the UN says, not because the chain of command would change.               And if that happened, these people would be released?               But the relevance of that is General MACArthur was an agent of several allied powers.               Then, to me, it's a matter of Hirota at the moment, and the only distinction you haven't addressed is at that time, I think in 1946, the basic habeas rule was that you wouldn't question a judgment of a tribunal, at least not a foreign tribunal. And it was just beginning in the issue -- to question judgments in American tribunals.                And, therefore, the obvious question is:       Well, doesn't that explain Hirota?               But am I right to assume the underlying situation to be that of Hirota?              Yes, but you see what I mean by that?   I mean, these issues of the war zone and so forth are not really there in this case; that we're talking here about a person whose being held in a manner that's comparable for habeas purposes to the Japanese or aliens who were held in Hirota.              They're being held by the Army, which is in part, which is in relevant part serving as an occupying force, to be turned over to a different tribunal.              Okay, thank you.
06-1717 +++$+++              I would not say no one else, but not everyone else places the importance on legislative history that I do, but I do.                 And I saw here that the Senate Judiciary Committee considered all these arguments, they wrote a report; and they sided with the government.              And I know it was there, but it doesn't matter to me it was on a bill that was later not passed, and then unless there is something different --              -- for that reason, because in my own mind I'm thinking there were a group of people on the committee, they went through the issue, they reflected views of their principles, they work it out, and unless something changed that makes me think that isn't the working out of it, I would put a lot of weight on it.              And now you're going to tell me what there is, I hope.
06-179 +++$+++               I thought that was something a little different than that.                    The question that I have which might be helpful to me, if you can answer it, is -- that's being serious about it -- I'd be helped by knowing what the specific design defect is that you claim?   That is, in what respect was this catheter -- and I'd like you to refer to the details of the catheter -- in what respect, what material or what shape or what -- what it is about this catheter that you as the plaintiff think was designed defectively, if you can tell me?              I know.          But you must have a theory.              What is it about the design that you are saying is not safe?               That is, you can't go into the court without having in your mind, as the counsel, that some kind of specific thing that was wrong with this catheter, other than just using the words "design."    I mean, how was it designed badly?             What part of the design is not right?              You are saying the material of the balloon should have been of a different material or a different thickness; is that right?              What does that mean?    How do you design something to burst?              If you don't know how to design the balloon, what are you basing the design claim on?              Let me tell you why I asked my question, because I don't want to leave -- you to leave with an unfavorable impression in my mind on your issue without your having a chance to see. What's worrying me is that, of course, it's a terrible thing when somebody is hurt in these kinds of accidents.     And the lawyers are trying to help.                   So the lawyers will think, look, there's a problem here.                      There must be.     My client was seriously hurt.                And he's not supposed to be. And then they'll work backward from that and say well if he was hurt, there must be something wrong with the design. So every time there is an accident or something bad happens, the lawyers assert a design claim and they gear up discovery. And in my mind, could Congress have intended that kind of thing when what they're trying to do is have a group of experts really look into this and decide whether it should marketed or not.                   That's what's bothering me.     And that's why I would like you to respond to that.
06-219 +++$+++              I'm surprised you say piecemeal.   I would have thought most agencies in the government have like an inspector general or someone that you can complain.             You can write them a letter and you say, look at what's been going on, they've been trespassing, they've indicted me on a false charge; I want you to see the whole list here and I'd like you to do something about it.       And if they don't do anything about it, you go to your senator.                Maybe you can go to the newspapers.   I mean, has any of that happened here?               And what's been the result of that?              Well, why is it a State law matter?    Why didn't he know about this possibility?                Why didn't he know that his predecessor in title had granted?     Why wasn't there an actual notice, given the fact that everybody in this area of the country seems as a matter of course to give mutually beneficial rights-of-way?    I agree it wasn't recorded.              If this case were identical, everything's the same, except that the officials involved are state officials, would there be a 1983 action?              That's a different -- that's a different reason.          That's a merits defense.         I just wondered if --              Yeah.       You're saying there is no Bivens action, period.              No, I'm not even thinking of it.   I just wonder if 1983 would apply and it would be clear that there is an action.                If you win, there would be no problem.
06-278 +++$+++               Well, why is that?   Why? Why?     I mean suppose you go on a school trip, and the teacher says on the school trip, I don't want people unfurling 15 foot banners.            I don't care what they are about.              We are going to visit the state capital and we are not marching down the street with 15 foot banners.       I mean, does the First Amendment say the teacher can't say that?              You just said suppose -- why should I not say that?           I mean I'm not going to do it, necessarily.   But why could I not say, would it be wrong in an opinion to say a school board can on a school trip tell the students they can't unfurl 15 foot banners?   Is that a correct statement of the law or not? In your opinion.              Well, why go into this?   I mean, that's what I actually, seriously don't understand.     Suppose the rule has the following rule: by the way, on our field trips you can carry around 15 foot banners.     They can say anything.                  Except they can't talk about drugs and they can't talk about sex and they can't talk about -- I don't know.                  Or I'd say three things.   Would that be constitutional?              Suppose that this particular person had whispered to his next door neighbor, "Bong Hits 4 Jesus, heh heh heh," you know. Supposed that's what had happened? (Laughter.)              No.     What would be different -- that's what I -- what a principal that has to act quickly sees across the street at a school meeting, a big banner go up making a joke out of drug use.   So the principal acts. Now, are we supposed to divide that into little bitsy parts?       Because as soon as we do we are going to get a rather interesting, complicated and very difficult set of constitutional rules.                    But you want us to do that.
06-313 +++$+++               It is -- I agree with you, I agree with you that we should look at the whole picture.     When I look at the whole picture -- I've actually got a little chart that my law clerk prepared. And what he did, he went through this and looked at a case called Newlon and it was the same prosecutor.                And the prosecutor was told in that case just what he shouldn't do.    And now if we look what he did in this case and look what he did in that case and look at the law, the whole thing, not just little bits, it looks like he did an awful lot of what he wasn't supposed to do. You're not supposed to give an argument that vouches as the U.S. attorney that I think that this is what you should do.       So in Newlon he says:           I'm talking to you as prosecuting attorney of the county, the top law enforcement officer.           And here he says:       I'm the top law enforcement officer and I decide in which cases we have the death penalty and not.                Worse than Newlon, I would say. Then what you're not supposed to do is you're not supposed to tell them they're like soldiers. I mean, there's Supreme Court cases that say, don't tell them you're like a soldier doing duty.                     At least that's what all these prosecutors -- a case called Byron versus the United States.      So in Newlon what he says is:                 I want to impress on you, this is a war and it's justifiable to kill in war.              Here he says:         As in the movie "Patton" and in the movie George Patton is talking to his troops because they're going out in battle like the soldiers.   And then he says:                And when you're a soldier, you know what to do when you put your hand in a pile of goo that a moment before was your best friend's face; you'll know what to do; and last July this defendant's face was a pile of goo. Okay, there we are.               I mean, that sounds pretty emotional.     It sounds like a soldier does his duty and you're doing it. And then another thing you're not supposed to do is you're not supposed to tell them it's their duty to the community.         And this is just filled with instances where you hardly even know that there's a person called Weaver because he says:                     What you have to do here is send a message to the drug lords, send a message --             Well, there's a brief --             It's not?         Why did they file -- is this brief wrong, then, the brief of the former prosecutors giving the propositions that I just stated and have the Supreme Court case next to each one? Are they wrong, those prosecutors?             Was there with the Patton and the goo?             Was there a curative instruction?             In Viereck the words were "This is war, harsh, cruel, murderous war."                And the prosecutor went on to analogize the jury's duties to the duties of soldiers and he said:               Do your duty.         Do you think that's a lot different than this case?              So those things that are improper for a prosecutor to make in summing up in the guilt phase, are they then proper to say, exactly those things, in a sentencing phase with capital -- with -- you know, capital sentencing?              There are a number of cases in this Court that say what a prosecutor can't say, guilt phase.    All of them happen to be guilt phase, I guess.    You can't, you know, vouch.                    You can't use too much emotion.    You have to focus on what the defendant did, not on what somebody else did.                      I mean, there are a number of things. Now, do those -- is it fair or not fair to say that those precedents apply in the capital sentencing phase, too?
06-340 +++$+++               I understand very well your argument that if the EPA is going to transfer this, they transfer it to Arizona and the first thing they say is, we look at Arizona's laws and they protect everything. And now we look at our own authority and if they get -- start mucking around with this, we can refuse the permit.     And besides that, we have a memorandum of understanding and the memorandum of understanding or whatever it is, agreement or something, is going to be they're going to pay as much attention as we are.                      So they'll pay attention to this, too, and if they don't we have an enforcement mechanism.                So no problem; we are not putting any species in jeopardy.                      We satisfy the standard.    I've got that part of the argument.                    I think I paraphrased it pretty well. The part I don't get is then you say, anyway, we don't have to do any of this because it says "shall transfer," therefore, it's not discretionary, it's mandatory.    That part I don't get because there are nine standards there and it seems to me to say that is rather like saying, well, the ICC used to say you shall let the railroad build a spur, provided it's in the public interest, convenience, and necessity. I mean, are you suddenly saying every statute that uses the word "shall" is not subject to the ESA?              All right, fine.              Now, my problem with saying it's clear is that they have nine criteria.                One of the criteria is you look to five other statutes, which they have their own criteria and one of those criteria is you have to be certain that the State will assure the protection and propagation of a balanced population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife. And by the time you get through those nine criteria, I don't think you'd have to be too imaginative a lawyer to figure out ways that they involve everything the ESA involves.     So if there ever was an act prefaced by the word "shall" where the ESA would apply, you would think it would this be this one, which has to do with water, environmental protection, nine criteria, many vague, and they use words like "wildlife," "shellfish," et cetera.              What's a mandatory decision?    No, what's a discretionary decision?                 I mean, in the sense you're using it.               I've never heard of an agency that could just give out money to whoever they want, like you or me.        There are always criteria.              Write a "shall"; there are always criteria.              You mean is it the word "unless," because here we have nine and they're broad. Probably with funding we have 32.                  Maybe with some others we have 14.      But I can't get my mind around --
06-376 +++$+++              It seems to apply just to abuse of discretion.  just apply to abuse of discretion?             It says you have jurisdiction to determine whether it's an abusive discretion.    Maybe I'm reading the wrong place.                    6404 --             Right.           Well that standard doesn't apply to the (e)(2).             It has nothing to do with it; (e)(2) says if it's a refund, abate, if not, not. It's not a question of abuse of discretion or not.
06-413 +++$+++                What has this to do with the -- aside from the explanation, when I read through the transcript, as I have, it seemed to me in the transcript he didn't say a word that suggested he's against giving the death penalty.                   He kept saying yeah, in special circumstances, not always.                      Then they get into this thing where he's been thinking of a person who will in fact commit a crime again.                    And then it's put to him directly:      Have you thought about that he won't be committing a crime again if he's in jail the rest of his life.   He says:    You're right; I hadn't really thought it through. I want to know, thinking it through, could you consider the death penalty?                 Do you think under the conditions where the man would never get out again you could impose it?     Yes, sir. So you don't think that if parole was an option, etcetera, repeating it.                 Death penalty?      I could consider it.    Then could you impose it?                   I could if I was convinced that was the appropriate measure. And it's absolutely clear he's not thinking of the repetition.       It is clear he is thinking that it's some kind of a mean.         And I compare that with Witt, where the person just says no, I can't, and I compared it with this other case, Gray, and they say it's illegal to push him off a jury, a woman who is confused, and finally she says:    I think I could.              Well, that's probably right.              So what is it that he could have done?   Was he shaking, making faces?               Was he shaking his head to indicate he believed the opposite?              If something like that happened, isn't a prosecutor of any sense going to say, I want it noted for the record that the witness while he said these words was chortling inwardly or something like that?
06-427 +++$+++               Was there anything at the trial that came out that the investigator when they were in the private session said a fact about Bart King of supreme importance that they didn't know about?
06-43 +++$+++  
06-457 +++$+++                The answer to that is it may be a very good idea, so convince Congress to pass a law.   It's just that if every State does it differently it's going to be a nightmare.              And I don't know what the answer to that point is. And I don't know what the answer to the point is about banning things.               I'm amazed if that's what you mean.    I'm not sure what you mean.            I mean, North Carolina could pass a statute that says the following:    Everybody in North Carolina over the age 16, say, or maybe everybody including small children -- I don't know what they want to pass -- can smoke to their heart's delight, can buy as many cigarettes as they like, but you can't ship in a single cigarette from out of State. You think that wouldn't cause -- raise a Commerce Clause problem?             Yes.             Well, that's why I'm just not certain about bans that forbid people to ship things inside from outside the State, while allowing people to buy those things produced by people inside the State. That's why I'm uncertain about the concession you're talking about.             I mean, what is this New York law that does this?              But the thing I'm concerned about is -- is assume it's perfectly legal to do what you said.     I guess it still wouldn't be legal for Maine or New York to say the following:                  We really want to discourage people from smoking, a noble goal.                   And, therefore, whenever an interstate shipper ships tobacco into the State, he has to charge double the price, just double the shipment price or ten times the shipment price.   Could they say that?              All right.              All right.       But could they say you have to carry it in special packages which the sticker -- which maybe you should do, but which the sticker puts skull and crossbones on each of the packages?   Could they say that?              No.     All right.
06-480 +++$+++                You say very.     Which economists?    I know the Chicago school tends to want rule of reason and so forth.               Professor Sherer is an economist, isn't he?        Worked at the FTC for a long time. A good expert in the field.               He points out the drug industry after you got rid of -- after you got rid of resale price maintenance, the margins fell 40 percent. The drug stores it went down 20 percent.                  He says with blue jeans, alone, it saved American consumers $200 million to get rid of it.            And his conclusion is, as in the uniform enforcement of resale price maintenance, the restraints can impose massive anti-consumer benefits. Massive.               What that sounds like is that if at least he, who is an economist, thinks if you get rid of Dr. Miles, every American will pay far more for the goods that they buy at retail.                     Now that's one economist, of course.       There are other whose think differently.    So how should we decide this?              Should we overturn Dr. Miles and run that risk?              We're supposed to count economists?              Is that how we decide it? (Laughter.)              Well, I haven't seen a consensus.    A consensus?        Isn't, doesn't Sherer and all these people, doesn't that point of view count, too?               Well, I don't know.     We have -- you talked about -- just for fun I got out of the library a book by Professor B. S. Yamey, called resale price maintenance where he has five economists -- now maybe you're not going to count them as economists. Now I didn't find in that book a single argument that isn't also in your briefs, nor did I find in your brief as single argument that isn't in the book. There's one interesting thing about the book.   It was written in 1966.               So I guess my question is what's changed?      Now I know two things have changed. One is there's evidence in Canada, Britain, and in the states that were under Miller-Tydings, that when you got rid of resale price maintenance, prices went down.   That's changed.             And the second thing that's changed is there's far more concentration, I gather, today in the retail side of the market than there are used to be, a factor which makes resale price maintenance dangerous because it's more likely to take place at the request of the dealers. Now, I see those two changes.                My question to you is looking at Yamey's book which is called Resale Price Maintenance, so you might have found even it even on Google, and --    what's changed?                What's new?             Maybe I'll put my question, which is really just one for this.                  I understand perfectly that the per se rule is a result of balancing differ things.    Of course, resale price maintenance does raise prices, and it is very often anticompetitive.                      Of course, sometimes, there are good reasons for it that might help consumers. Now, in addition, you need clear rules.                  Now those three sets of things require a balance.              And we have a hundred years of history where this Court and Congress and others have balanced those three sets of considerations, and they've come out one way.              Now, the Department of Justice wants to rebalance them and come out the other way. There are good arguments on both sides.                  Why should we overrule a case that's 96 years old, in the absence of any -- any -- congressional indication that that's a good idea, when it's simply a question in a difficult area of people reaching a slightly different weight on some these three sets of things?                 I would think it is quite a close question.                 All right, even so.   Go ahead.              Price fixing, horizontal, I guess, or territorial divisions, we should overturn those too.                What you say is right. What you say there is right.            I feel I'm back in 1966. The argument against that is, we don't know which way the push comes.   The large retailers, Home Depot, whatever they are, huge retailers, they want -- or maybe it isn't the discounters, it's some other once.               We don't know which way.      You're throwing it into court. You're throwing it before 12 people who may or may not work this thing out.      So the argument against what you're saying is not logic.            It's empirical and administrative.             That's what it was.    That's what it is now, I guess.
06-484 +++$+++                 But suppose it says, which I think it did say, that Mr. Notebaert typically stayed on top of the company's financial health by having weekly conversations with other executives.                   He had his hands on the pulse of the company.                   He saw weekly sales reports and product -- projection -- production projections.     Now it seems like an allegation that's very specific.              Well, I thought they alleged at least that for about a year previously in respect to the 506500 that it was wrong known throughout the company that the 6500 had been delayed.             Don't they make an allegation like that?              The 6500 has long been delayed.   Everyone knows that in the company.           So he knows it's long been delayed.              Then what he says is it is being shipped and delivered.            Something like that.              April '01, he says everything we can build we are building, and shipping. The demand is very strong.          And then what they say is of course nobody wanted any of it, it was long delayed, and they've known that since 1998 and he has his finger on the pulse of the company.              Oh.     Yeah.              What do you think in writing this opinion?       There are a couple of ways.                 One, you can find strong inference in terms of some other words.    Two, you could look to history.                  Or three, you could just try an example.           Say strong inference means strong inference.    Here's an example.                  This is a complaint.    It meets it, or it doesn't meet it.                    Which way, in your opinion, will work best in this case?              You had something else to say in answer to my question, which I would like to hear.
06-5247 +++$+++              And I don't think the majority said the contrary.            I mean, I wrote it.       I mean, I don't know -- what counts is what I wrote, not what I thought.   But if you read it, I don't think it decides this question. What I wonder, though, is why does the -- how does this case present the issue you want to argue? I'm -- Justice Ginsburg made me wonder about that.                 As I understand it, the trial court said, I'm not going to let this witness testify, it is cumulative.                 All right. And then the appeals court said, well, that wasn't a mistake.    And one reason it wasn't a mistake is that this witness added nothing.             There could no possible prejudice, says the trial court, when he excluded that person.    That means it was cumulative, that means it did nothing, and that was the appeals court.                 So the appeals court finds no error. Now, we get over to the Federal court.               And they say, oh, no, this witness added a lot.                Well, they couldn't have thought this witness added a lot to the point where the constitution is violated unless they disagreed with that decision of making no possible difference.    Very well.       We disagree, send it back.          End of case. Now, where does it raise all this stuff about harmless error and -- I mean, when I -- it is hard for me to get my mind around this issue, because it's so complicated.    How does this case raise it?             Was that as a reason for there not being error?        Or was it in the context of saying, well, even if there was a mistake, there was no possible prejudice.      What does the footnote mean, in your opinion?    The second?             What is the footnote number?             Okay.       I'll read it.             Thank you.         Very helpful. The other thing which I brought up, so I might as well get both my questions out, is that years ago I read a decision by Judge Leventhal that made a big impression on me.    And he was a very good judge.                  It's in a different context, it's the same problem. He said, I originally thought this was the case dreamed of by law professors, a case where I could conscientiously say, although I consider the findings clearly erroneous, so I'd reverse if it were a judge's decision, nonetheless, there is support and substantial evidence.   And therefore, I affirm it, because it comes from an agency. But when I think about it, I don't think there's substantial evidence either.                     Okay.   In other words, has there ever been a case in the history of mankind where you think a judge has actually thought to himself, after reviewing the record, oh, I think that this is harmless, so I'll affirm.                 But I don't think it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, so I'll reverse. I mean, I find it very difficult to get myself in that state of mind, where I think such a thing is possible.              But O'Neal, I thought O'Neal just says that this word "burden of proof" is out of place when you talk about an appellate judge reading the record.              How do they say that after I thought I wrote an opinion for the majority of the Court which said this concept is not applicable in -- when you're reviewing a record for harmless error.                   It's not a question of presenting evidence.                   What I think it said is that it's not a question of presentation of evidence.    In such a case, we think it's conceptually clear for the judge to ask directly, do I the judge think that the error substantially influenced the judge's -- the jury's decision?                Now, maybe I was wrong, but I think there was a majority of the Court that agreed with it.               To talk about burdens of proof?               Yes.      But that's my basic question in this case and it's a serious question. Suppose I think, which I do think, that I as a judge can conscientiously review a record and decide for myself whether I think this error of the judge was harmless, and if I really try I can bring myself to understand this question.    Regardless of what I think, could another judge, say a State judge, reasonably have thought the opposite?       I can do that mentally. You try to get me to make more fine distinctions than that, I cannot do it.                  I can't.   I'm sorry.   I admit it. Now, if that's the state of mind that I can get myself into -- and I believe that's true of many judges -- how do I write words that are realistic in this area?
06-5306 +++$+++                What about the weekends?        I mean, maybe the judge -- I -- it looks from my calendar -- I wondered what day of the week it was.                You don't remember.    2/10, February 10, 2004, what day of the week was it?               It looks like it was the middle of the week.      So maybe there were one or two weekends.   So maybe what the judge's mistake was, he didn't know how to count the weekend rule.               Which may not be jurisdictional, the weekend rule.               They're not.     A numeral is not jurisdictional. What's -- what's -- what's the three-day mail rule?              Speaking of the three-day mail rule, maybe the judge's intent when he signed this was that it actually was entered, took effect as of three days later.               Yeah, but in the -- in this thing, it says entered on February 10.             But it says it in the index, it says -- it says docket entries.                     2-10, it says entered 2-10, on page 11.          On page 11.             Received.        So-
06-531 +++$+++                 Who -- who -- where does it say you have to have done that?                My statute here says in any action to enforce a provision of 1983 -- the TRO or whatever was such an action.              It says the court in its discretion may allow the prevailing party an attorneys' fee.   Well, did they prevail fail or not?                    They got what they wanted.     And it was such an action.                  Doesn't say anything about whether you have been declared horrible or wonderful or violator or not a violator.                     It says did they get what they want in the action?                     Answer, yes. End of matter. Now what's wrong with reading it that way?               Yeah, they got the legal claim.   The legal claim is we want to have our demonstration on February 14; we have a right to do it and therefore issue an order.              You said no, don't issue the order, because they don't.               And therefore, they won.               It is not?               Yeah.       But what about the legal claim we are under the law entitled to a preliminary injunction.              Well I thought, where it say that in the statute that you have to have that particular kind of a claim?              So what do you think, when this was enacted, to make up an example that it is as horrifying as I can think, where the Ku Klux Klan was riding in the South, and a group of civil rights demonstrators wanted to make certain they could have their demonstration outside the jail and they go to the judge and says the sheriff is involved in this, the whole town is; we want an injunction tomorrow. Tomorrow.     Right now.     So -- and we don't really care that much about the end of it, but we'll -- we'll go ahead and litigate it if you want.                   Now they get their injunction.     They have the demonstration; it's over.                   I would have thought if there was a situation for which 1983 was written, it's that one.              Oh, there is.      The other side has a lot of arguments.              And they each have arguments.    There are plenty of issues of law.             What is the law in respect to this, which is right on the point you're arguing, that two parties have this kind of suit and the government party -- they settle it, and giving everything that the plaintiff conceivably wants, but at the end they say:    We don't admit we violated the law. Can you get attorney's fees there or not.             It's a consent decree, but no admission of a violation of law.
06-5618 +++$+++               Where does that come from as a matter of law?     That is, suppose -- now you can say I -- if you want, say my hypothesis is wrong, but if I start with an assumption that Congress did want the court of appeals to try to create greater uniformity in sentencing, and it wanted cooperation between the courts of appeals and the sentencing commission, indeed the sentencing commission itself is an effort to copy a system that exists in Britain where courts of appeals create a degree of uniformity. Suppose I start with that assumption and say that's what the guidelines were about and the reason that number 4 is in 3553, it's not just one factor among many.   After all, it was attached to a bill that was the guideline bill. And indeed, the part we excised was a floor amendment that came along later to make it even tougher. So if I start with the assumption that's what Congress wanted, not what I wanted, Congress wanted it, now is there something in the Constitution that forbids it? That's where I start -- I am starting personally with that question in mind, always, if this is what Congress wanted, we should try to do it unless there's something in the Constitution that forbids it. And is there something in the Constitution that would forbid the court of appeals to do what on page 91 they did here, leaving the word extraordinary out of it? Now, just going through the different elements of this case and coming to the conclusion that what the district judge did was unreasonable?              It's not mandatory.       It says the district, the court of appeals judge says, now, let's think here.     We have 8 -- 7 people on the sentencing commission that have really looked into that. And they think that in an ordinary course with this small amount of drugs, the person ought to get so many months.     That reflects a lot of thought.               Seems reasonable to us.     And here the district judge is giving him half that or 40 percent of that without a good reason that we can find. The judge said he did it because it was just one little episode and we think there were many episodes.     And that's basically their reason. Now, now -- what -- the Sixth Amendment forbids that?              Yeah --             Yeah, yeah.      But there -- you know, we can go back into that, but there was a whole history that people testified, tremendously, no opposition, virtually none, that you needed a judge wheel.   Why do you need a judge wheel in New York if, in fact, the sentence didn't depend on the personality of the judge?     And why did you get different sentences across the country which I don't -- I've never heard a possibility of explaining that the judges didn't understand what the parole commission was like.                       That's a different issue. So what -- what I'm concerned about is if we followed your position literally, what we're saying is that the Constitution of the United States prevents any effort to create uniform sentences throughout the country for people who different judges -- God doesn't tell us what the right sentence is.                       We don't know. There are reasonable sentences within a vast, vast range of possible sentences. And you're saying we have to go back to that.     And that wasn't -- I'm looking, in other words, for you to tell me something that says we don't have to be back to that, but we don't have to make it that rigid either.    And that's what I'm looking for, to be honest with you, and I haven't -- I'm not certain I get it.                Do you agree?    Because I think that system would, in fact, give total sentencing power to the prosecutor, who would determine the sentence by the kind and degree of evidence that he introduced and what he charged.                So I agree that that might produce some kind of judicial uniformity, but only because the prosecutor would have total power to decide what the sentence will be.                We're pointing out there are problems to every solution.                And that's why I'm still looking for the --              Better than what?    Better than justifies it?
06-562 +++$+++               What are -- what are they? I mean as I read this, I can't get anything out of the language.     I mean the two "others" might just make it more clear.     So we have another Section 113 that talks about contribution and it says you can get contribution if there has been a lawsuit, and so forth, or if there has been a settlement.         Fine. Now the question comes up, well, suppose there hasn't been a lawsuit or a settlement.                  Now if we look at the language here, at least my initial reading of it, it does not say.          It says that they are liable. These PRPs are liable to this other PRP or person there. But it doesn't just say explicitly bring a suit, and it doesn't say explicitly you can't bring a suit. So I think well, why can't he bring a suit? If he brings a suit how is the sky to fall?                  On the other hand, if you don't let him bring a suit, they say well, maybe the Government just -- will just stay out of this.   The Government won't enter into settlements because the Government is a big polluter.               And it would not like to get sued often, so they will stay away from the settlement and be home free. So that's what they say on your -- on their side, I think, primarily.          What do you say on your side? How will the sky fall if in fact they win and they can bring suits under 107?              Can I -- can I go back? Because I'm trying to, since I do find it so open with the language, what I'm doing is making what I call the list of acorns.     You say the sky is falling and I want a comparative list.               And they like to settle. Don't worry about it.       All right. On your side, you're saying well, you know, if we don't -- if we don't -- accept your interpretation, they won't enter into settlements.              To which I guess they will make the same response.              Are you kidding?   The EPA loves to sue us and we are frightened of them and we'll settle. Okay.    So I've got one acorn each side, now are there other acorns on the Government side; namely the sky is falling --               What are they?   I'd just like to make the whole list of acorns.
06-571 +++$+++              What do you have besides the linguistic argument?        I mean, when I start out, I can't think of a reason why Congress wouldn't want to penalize the buyer, not the seller.                    We are dealing with a statute that does catch your client, if they had only charged him with the right part.              But no one in his right mind would ever rely on a ruling in your favor to actually engage in such a transaction, since it would violate the statute in 15 different ways.                   I exaggerate, but you see the point. So you have a linguistic argument which people are -- you're right, I think, in saying it's awkward but not impossible.           And, therefore, awkward but not impossible; we create an anomaly in the law.                   I can't think of a reason why to do it.                   So what else do you have?             And sometimes we try to --             Sometimes policy seems relevant, too, to figure out what Congress wanted. But let me go back to the question I had, which is do you want to us overturn Smith?               Are you asking that, because I could understand it more easily if you said, look, both sides of the transaction should be treated alike, but they should be both outside the word "use."             But he receives the gun and it could have been loaded.           And if it was loaded, you receive a loaded gun, and you're there and you give the money for the gun and you have the gun and somebody comes up, maybe you'll shoot him.                 I mean, that seems like a risk.              I thought Bailey involved a guy, he had the gun in a locked thing in the trunk of his car, which is a little different from holding it in your hand.
06-5754 +++$+++                 Well, you know, you don't get a summary judgment case all the time.                    I used to get them, and the district court would hear all the arguments and write down the word denied.                    Does that mean he didn't consider the arguments?                    That's a very common thing.     Here we have a district judge, he hears all the arguments.      The attorneys brought it out.                It's in the file.     He reads the presentence report.                 It's all there, and the judge says, on balance, I'm going to go apply the guidelines.        So how can you say he didn't consider them?                No, he doesn't in a summary judgment case either.        I mean, I've had quite a few of them, I used to, I think, where they just wrote denied. That was the opinion.                Now, he says the reasons are these.   I think that the guidelines sentence is a reasonable sentence.        Would that be sufficient?               Why not?        What in the statute or the law or the Constitution says that a district judge, although it might be good form in a difficult case to write more, but I've often written opinions where I say, and the remaining arguments we feel are not sufficient to change the result.                   That means I don't think they're that great an argument, and I don't answer every single one.               Where in the law does it say that?              So it isn't sufficient, in your view, that the judge just says, the reason I imposed this sentence is that's the guideline sentence, and I think in this circumstance it's reasonable?              I think these other factors that have been brought out, while they're serious factors, I don't think they're enough to warrant a different sentence.     Suppose he adds those words?              What I'm worried about basically is, I don't think in the law there's a special category that requires a judge to give special reasons in a guideline case.      I think it's the same as any other matter.     Judges do normally give reasons.              And I'd worry a bit about creating a special situation where district judges have to do something unusual.               Well, I get where you're going.     Can I say this in an opinion, would this satisfy you?     And of course, like any other matter, judges do normally give reasons.         They do normally reject arguments with reasons, and it's the same here.                Would that satisfy you?             Then the question ultimately is, does it violate the Sixth Amendment to say that we have a presumption there, a sentence is in the guidelines as a reasonable -- if you're an appellate court judge.    And you think it does violate the Sixth Amendment?             Then I guess the argument of the other side, which I would like you to address, is that, in which there -- we didn't think it violated the of Sixth Amendment if the district judge simple applied 3553 -- uh, 3553(a).       And of course, 3553(a) includes all of these things that go into the guidelines; it make a big point of that in 3553(a). So why -- why couldn't you say, you know, all these factors are taken into account by the commission?    They start with an effort to a apply them in typical cases.    This is their judgment in typical cases.   So it is entitled to some kind of weight; and -- at least in a typical case.             No, no, not consulting them.    What I'm trying to do is to how much weight can a judge reading this give them without violating the Sixth Amendment?    All I'm trying to do here is not whether the guidelines are good, bad, or indifferent.                Congress wanted to apply them.       We excised the mandatory to comply with the Sixth Amendment.                Now, what else do we have to do to comply with the Sixth Amendment?                Because I would think unless we have to do something else, we shouldn't do it, because Congress wanted it.             There are two separate things there.   The general aims of sentencing, the four basic aims of sentencing, I believe the commission certainly took into account.            A separate thing was the rule that said you can depart only for a matter that has not been fully considered by the guidelines. And there the original version, I believe, said that we've considered nothing thoroughly.                   Except for certain specific matters that had been mentioned like age, race, and we'll refer to statutorily.                   Now, that is what you're thinking of?               I mean, if that's what you're thinking of, I don't think it's relevant to what your present point is.             That's because when they looked at all of the literature, they explained it, the rehabilitative purpose was not that it wasn't taken into account, it was there was a consensus among experts that there isn't much you can do about it.                   That's different from not taking into account.

06-618 +++$+++                  Don't you agree with Justice Scalia -- Justice Alito?                 Don't you agree with Justice Alito?   I thought he's saying it's a ruling on constitutionality.              I see.                What does he do?         I mean I looked at what he does in 74, 75, 76a.                     He seems to spend a lot of time moving furniture.                     He lists that twice.   He runs the office.             And he represents, he is out in the local office somewhere and he talks to constituents.     I mean, he doesn't even appear in the Senate office except very rarely in which case he is doing casework.     So I guess if he is included in that, I mean so is a full-time furniture mover.                I have the whole list here. What here suggests, he ever -- he doesn't even write a statement for the floor.           There is nothing here that suggests one word of anything he did ever went to a committee meeting, to a floor of the Senate, anything.             What?             What are the words?             I agree with that one.   I just said he doesn't do anything that gets to the floor of the Senate, that gets to a committee report, that gets to a committee hearing.             Now what in there -- and you said it was not contested, so I guess the best source if it's not contested is his affidavit.              Oh.     Where does it say that?    He drafted legislation that was then introduced?              Where does it say that?              What's wrong with this?           I found what you're talking about here.                     It says in paragraph 13, contrary to what he says in his own evaluation, that Senator Dayton's staff, including Mr. Hanson -- that's a little uncertain, what they mean by that -- introduced a bill and drafted it.                    Okay?    And then on paragraph 14 they say on November 15th, 2001, Mr. Hanson -- just as you said -- planned a Senate Government Affairs Committee meeting, selected hearing witnesses and prepared questions. Now suppose that we did as the court, lower court wanted to do, say let's just see if that becomes relevant.    Because it's possible, given his other tasks that those two incidents, one on November 15th and the other, whenever help he gave to the drafting, had nothing to do with his being fired and nobody claims that.   So what they said is let's wait and see if that becomes relevant.     Now what's wrong with that solution?              All right.       Let's make an absurd case out of it which I'm trying to do a little bit to get you to focus on it.              Let's suppose he got fired because he didn't move the furniture properly.
06-6330 +++$+++               The basis is that that would be the end of the Guidelines.                       I mean, that -- every judge has his own view of policy and there is a vast range.    No   point having advice -- I mean, fine, but I don't think this Court said it, and I think that the test is supposed to be reasonableness, and I think 3553(a) does have a lot of instructions, and one of the major thrusts is follow the Guidelines.                      It doesn't make them mandatory.     But they're in there. All right,       so the problem for me is just what Justice Alito was saying:                Is there a path here between saying, well, judge, leaving everything special about your case out of it -- we're only talking about a judge who says there's nothing special about my case -- I disagree with the policy of the commission. In such a case, is there a choice between saying that no matter what the commission says, the court of appeals must insist that their district judges follow in terms of a policy; and the opposite, which is to say they don't have to do anything that the commission says, because the commission is always choosing among reasonable choices.                  Very rarely -- maybe you have one in this case -- but very rarely is it totally unreasonable. How do we thread the channel?             To the extent that it's reasonable, and where we're talking about individual cases we've already said, given the history of our legal system, it's very reasonable to give lots of discretion to the district judge. Now we're talking about what's reasonable in the context of 3553(a); and I don't think Booker says one way or the other on that, nor I do believe Rita says one way or the other.             Driven by a Congress that wrote guidelines; and at the last minute, in a separate matter that we've taken out and wasn't put in the initial draft added the word "mandatory."               So the history of 3553(a) is a history of a statute that is seeking uniformity through guidelines. At least that's my view of it.              And for purposes of the question, which is an important question to me, let's assume that.             In other words, I'm assuming now you have not -- you don't have a good answer to my question.       You're saying either we have to make it unconstitutional, which I don't think they are, or you have to say anything goes, and that my question has no answer in your view?

06-6407 +++$+++ 
06-666 +++$+++                  Suppose that you -- and I have the same hypothetical for both you and your brothers on the other side with some adjustment here, because I'm finding the case quite difficult.                  And the, the -- for you, imagine we have some milk producers in Kentucky.   They are farmers.             And they go to the legislature and they say, you know, we can sell a lot more milk in Kentucky if you will pass a law imposing a tax on Missouri farmers who want to ship milk into Kentucky.   That's the classic unlawful -- all right. It's unlawful, unconstitutional, right.               All right.      Now, what is the difference if a city in Kentucky that wants to finance its schools says now to the legislature, we're going to find it easier to sell bonds in Kentucky or elsewhere, in Kentucky, for our school system if you'll only put a tax on similar bonds that Missouri is offering to finance their city schools?                 That will help, just like the milk.     Now, what's the difference?              We have consumers in the dairy products that are suffering loss.                  They're all the voters in the States.       Everyone drinks milk.              So they are suffering a dollar-for-dollar loss, because their milk becomes more expensive. I don't know if that's analogous.                I think it's a pretty strong analogy.              As to the first, that's of course the point that's worrying me.                  It is true that this is a public matter.              Would it make a difference in the first case if it happened to be some dairy farmers who -- there are so few in Massachusetts now, unfortunately, that they all work on State-owned dairy farms that are put up for, you know -- does it make a difference?             It would make a difference?
06-6911 +++$+++  
06-694 +++$+++                Indeed, it is covered by the statute because I read your brief as saying that the statute applies only in instances where either you're trying to sell it or trade it.              That is what you're trying -- now it seems to me a different matter if it's covering only -- covering as well instances where somebody's simply showing it to someone else to show him what he got in the mail.         Well, I'd appreciate clarity on that.               If that's covered by the statute, what you're going to do then is suddenly criminalize what could be an awful lot of activity that goes on in schools all over the place and somebody has -- they think it's funny, and maybe it isn't funny, but they think it is and it's kind of school-boy behavior, and they're showing this stuff around, not totally certain what it is.            Suddenly that can become a Federal crime.   Seems like quite an extension.            And I thought you'd written your way out of that problem, and now I think you haven't.              All right.       Then take it as that.              Take it as that.      I would say looking and presenting to schoolmates dirty pictures is a fairly common adolescent and post-adolescent activity.     And I would suspect a very high-level percentage of that class of people don't examine too carefully what the age of the individuals depicted is, and many might misrepresent what that age is.                  So this sounds like a statute that has enormous reach, whereas previously I thought it hadn't.

06-766 +++$+++               The theory of this, I take it, is that, just as you said, voters elect convention delegates, and those convention delegates choose the official nominee, say, of the Democratic Party.             So that nominee goes on to the final ballot.              Well, what then of the fact that the convention delegates when they meet won't let people who would like the position of the judge appear before them?              It's not?              Well then, how are the delegates to find out the qualifications?               In other words, if that's the intent of this statute, then you have a statute that's designed on the one hand to have convention delegates who will choose, and on the other hand to prevent the convention delegates from finding out the qualifications of the different applicants, in which case it would seem to be a statute that would give the actual power of selection to the leader or the chairman -- I forget the title -- of the Democratic Party.   And I don't know about the constitutionality of that or not.   In other words, go ahead.
06-7949 +++$+++               What in your opinion is supposed to happen if we have Guidelines, a part of 3553(a), a part of it -- voluntary or not, they're referred to, so -- and I understand how you would deal with this.    If the district judge's sentence rests upon his view of the facts, the appeals court is supposed to say it's the district judge that counts here.                 I can understand if it's a question of judgment, a matter of judgment about this case the court of appeals is supposed to say:              District judge, it's your view that matters here. Now, the difficult matter is, suppose that this district judge says:            I don't approve of the way Guidelines treat a certain class of people and I am going to have a different sentence because I don't like what they do.     And now there are several situations: one, different from his fellow judges in the same court; two, different from other judges across the country; three, different from what the Guidelines did initially; four, different from what the Guidelines say after the commission has over and over and over reconsidered the same matter. All right, that I find difficult and I'd like your view.               Wait, wait, wait, wait. I think what you're saying is that -- which is the subject of the next case, really --               But I want to know your view of it.    Too.    I want to know your view of it, too, because what I want to figure out here by the end of today is what are the words that should be written in your opinion by this Court that will lead to considerable discretion on part of the district judge but not totally, not to the point where the uniformity goal is easily destroyed. That's what I'm asking your view on, and I'd like your view and the SG's view and everyone else who's arguing today.
06-8120 +++$+++               The California Supreme Court as far as I could tell was thinking that it turns, if you stop somebody, you stop somebody, if you make him think he isn't free to go. So you seem to me to give a lot of cases where he would feel free to go, and you're saying still that that's a stop.      Well, I mean, suppose the policeman comes along and he sees three people in a car and there is Jack the Ripper driving.             So he says okay, I'm stopping the car.     Now he says the other three people, I'm not interested in you; my pal and partner here is in a second squad car; he will take you wherever you want to go.   Have they been stopped?             No.             Okay.       Well, I don't think you're going to find authority for that in the law.                  At least not in this Court.          I mean, I'd like to know what it is.   Maybe you are.       I think that would be very interesting.             Brower --              What, what were the facts there?              There was a roadblock.              So what it says here, getting out their quote from it, is it says it does not occur whenever there is a governmentally caused termination in individual's freedom of movement, nor even where there is a governmentally caused and governmentally desired termination of an individual's freedom of movement.      That only when there is a termination of freedom of movement through means intentionally applied. Now, the only way I can -- I mean I say the difference between desired is that they didn't want to stop him.   They are not interested in stopping him. That's not our desire to stop him.                 Our desire is to stop the driver. So if you don't have the desire and if there is no real restriction of any significance, is there a stop?     I mean I would say Brower, they cited on their side, for that language.              Well, the passenger, you also have to have two things.               One they don't intentionally want to stop him.                Two, he doesn't think his movement is restricted.              Where both of those things are true, then no stop.          That's why the people who, say, are on the railroad car and they stop the whole train, that the railroad says don't worry, not an inconvenience:    We'll have another train for new 10 or 15 minutes; just get out, except for car one where there is Jack the Ripper -- you know, those other people are not stopped. Now that's their argument.                  What's your response?
06-8273 +++$+++ 
06-84 +++$+++               Would you say it's all right to use the model penal code definition of reckless, which is basically what you -- taking it here, you would have to consciously disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the action is unlawful?              If you come across anything that would use that, I mean "reckless" itself is unclear.   The model penal code tried to clarify it based on this Court's opinions primarily.              What's the difference?              Well, you said there is no way they couldn't have been conscious of the risk here. I mean, after all, that's why they went to lawyers. They know there's risk that this is unlawful.              But consciousness, I mean, maybe it should come in in the standard, but I don't know that that would help you.              That isn't how the statute defines it.              The statute says an adverse action is an increase in a charge for -- in connection with underwriting.              That's what it says.      And then it says an increase is -- and if you take an adverse action, i.e., if you increase it, and your increase is based in whole or in part on information contained in a consumer report, you have to send the thing.    How did you get -- in your example, there was no increase.    I mean, in a charge.             In your salary, it's a decrease in the salary.         Same thing.              You mean unfavorable change in terms, unfavorable change in terms.              Well, suppose you don't have, you don't have any terms because you never did it before.   There's no change in terms.              You mean those words "change in terms" refer to rates, in other words? That's a rather odd way to refer to it.                      In one place, you refer to an "increase"; in the other place, you'd refer to it as a "change in terms."                      That's sort of an odd way to write a statute.              No, no, I understand that. But what we're after is this.               Everybody has a credit report, just about.       You put it in and you give people the best possible rate conceivable, and now, how do you know that maybe there could have still been a better rate?     And it can't be that the statute intends you to send out notices in such circumstances or you'd have to send notices whenever you read a credit report.               Now, I think that's, I've overstated slightly, but that's basically the argument.          So what's your response?              Okay, so your response is just to repeat my question and say that's right?

You can also teach through example.              So I look at this case, I say:    You want to know what that means, read the court of appeals opinion; it's perfect.                 Okay?   So I've got Firestone -- my opinion so far is two words: "Firestone, perfect."       Okay?         Now, what do you want me to say other than that?
06-937 +++$+++                But you couldn't put in -- you are authorized to sell the bicycle pedals that I have patented only if you impose a restriction that will tell the bicycle user that he must send me a check for $15 in addition to whatever he pays you.                 That sounds unlawful under contract law.               Or you are going to have -- I mean, there's a doctrine that you cannot impose equitable servitude's upon chattel.               That's a contract law doctrine.               My thought is that the reason that these things are important and you can't just draft your way around them is because there are antitrust doctrines, there are contract-law doctrines, that also limit in significant ways what you can and cannot write into a contract.
06-939 +++$+++                 Say speak, speak.   Just not on our nickel.                And they also say -- by the way, that you answer this, I'd keep this in mind -- you may be right about it being too much of an administrative burden, the treble damages et cetera, but they've made major concessions here, and they say that's a matter to be worked out on remand.                    And it may be that they have to be very careful about inhibiting your speech. So let's go back over those administrative provisions one by one.       They are suggesting to us, as I read it, don't do that now.               If you have -- you have a park service of the State and have you a hotdog stand there, it runs the hotdogs, it's private, but the State pays for everything.      The State pays for everything. And it happens that, in the grant, they have no place for talking about the union.            You're saying they are required to add to the legislation, a special grant, so that the employer can speak of the union?                Why?     Why?   Because they say here we are talking about 100 percent money that comes out of the State treasury and all we are saying is use that money for the State purposes, and those purposes do not include talking one way or the other about the union.              Would your answer be the same if -- if -- and I hide contrary to fact, perhaps, that a magic administrative scheme were invented so that there was no administrative problem, we could identify with the greatest of ease each penny that came from a State and which did not?          And then the State said, you know, we do have a policy here.               We actually favor labor unions in our State, and some other State might have a different policy.    But we think it best that the State officials involved when their company -- when their department is being organized, to say nothing.              We think it best that the employers that we pay a hundred percent to, given their -- their strong funding by the State, that they got to find some money elsewhere, and those we pay 50 percent to better use the private money, not use our money. Now, no administrative burden whatsoever, but that's the policy.        Now, is there some rule or statute that would make that unlawful or pre-empted that policy?              No, on all these things which I think they are asking us on the other side to leave for another day, none of them exist.                They all work perfectly.    It's only the magic system has been developed to, without any extraneous burden, segregate the State money from the non-State money.                And the only rule is don't use the State money when you speak. That's the only rule.              By the way, other states have exactly opposite rules, they are right-to-work states.    They give you extra State money.              So -- but one State has this rule and --              Ah, well, if it's a very different case, then why aren't they right to say this is a facial challenge, leave that very different case which raises all the issues to be worked out when we discover whether this is --              Is my right-to-work example equally -- equally pre-empted?              So, they could not say in Utah, to take a State at random, the -- here we have government grants and there's overhead, and we would like you to spend this overhead; indeed, you're certainly free to spend this overhead in speaking as much as you want, should there be an organizing campaign.   Don't worry about spending the government part.   Can they do that?        You say no, they couldn't?              No.

06-984 +++$+++                I thought --               I thought the question -- and I apologize if I'm not paraphrasing it because I have my own.   This has arisen frequently.              Brussels has a treaty, and that treaty binds all the member nations, and supreme courts of various nations have come up against this problem: What would happen if the Brussels court or the EU court insists under the treaty that we do something that violates our own Constitution?               I think this is an example of that.             And the answer typically has been:   Well, we'd follow our own Constitution, at least if it was a violation, what the EU said, of fundamental human rights or destroyed some basic structural part of our Constitution. And the question that I would have is, doesn't that kind of approach -- not exactly but that kind of approach -- satisfy whatever problem there is in this respect here?                 If the ICJ were to do something which it had never done, like, say, put everybody in jail for 50 years -- I don't know that there is such a thing -- but suppose they did, if they did, I guess that might violate something basic in our Constitution, in which case we wouldn't enforce it.                 If we took that approach --
06-989 +++$+++               On that point -- the reason I think you're -- there's a little chaos here is because you said -- your question is phrased, does the FAA preclude enforcement of your arbitration agreement?                      And you're going to say:      We answer that question, no, it doesn't preclude it.              It doesn't require it; it doesn't preclude it. But then would we have to go back and say what is the source?       There has to be some source of law that authorizes this contractual agreement, and there could be two possible sources.                And my question here is, is it clear that in fact either of these two sources does? The first source is State law.                    I gather the difficulty is that the State of Oregon has an act just like the Federal Arbitration Act, so we'd have to ask the Oregon courts:      Is this a legitimate contract under Oregon State law. The alternative source of law is the Federal judge's case management authority.                   And there we have a statute which clearly gives the judge some kind of authority, but not for your case because your case exceeds the jurisdictional amount.                   Therefore, in the absence of that statute, is there inherent authority in the district judge? Now, I don't know the answer to either of those questions.                 My temptation is to say they're open questions and they'd have to be argued on remand, which makes this case the case of the century, I guess, in a certain respect.             It's quite a difficult case.             All right.       Well, in a certain area.    I overstate. But the -- is there any light you can shed on those two questions, or is there some third possible source of law?              Have you ever argued that this is a matter governed by Oregon law and it is enforceable?              Have you ever argued that?              Yes, under Oregon law. Have you ever argued Oregon law?              No?              Well, then it's not surprising they haven't argued that Oregon law doesn't apply.
07-1015 +++$+++                How does -- how does this work in an ordinary case?            I should know the answer to this, but I don't.      It's a very elementary question. Jones sues the president of Coca-Cola.                    His claim is the president personally put a mouse in the bottle.                   Now, he has no reason for thinking that.                 Then his lawyer says: Okay, I'm now going to take seven depositions of the president of Coca-Cola.          The president of Coca-Cola says:    You know, I don't have time for this; there's no basis.   He's -- he's -- I agree he's in good faith, but he's -- there is no basis.            Okay, I don't want to go and spend the time to answer a question. Where in the rules does it say he can go to the judge and say, judge -- his lawyer will say -- my client has nothing to do with this; there's no basis for it; don't make him answer the depositions, please?             Where does it say that in the rules?             In Rule 8?               I thought Rule 8 was move for a more definite statement.               He shows a plausible entitlement.    He says -- there's no doubt it's a claim if the president of Coca-Cola did put the mouse in the bottle.   It's just there is no basis for thinking that.               So he wants to go to the judge and say:    I've set out a claim here; I copied it right out of the rules.          All right?               Now, what allows the judge to stop this deposition?             Where?             I'm sorry, I just don't have the answer to my question.               I must not have said it properly.    Imagine, way before Twombly -- these rules have been in existence for decades.                      So we go back years ago.    Certainly, there have been many cases where, for whatever reasons, the plaintiffs included allegations that were just factually very unlikely.                     I want to know where the judge has the power to control discovery in the rules.   That's -- I should know that.                     I can't remember my civil procedure course.                      Probably, it was taught on day 4. (Laughter.)              Well, I see that.           It says a person has a right to go and get discovery.                      It doesn't say they only control it under certain provisions which don't seem to me to apply to the truly absurd discovery.    There must be some power a judge has. And the second question I'm going to ask you, when you tell me what that power is, which apparently I'm not going to find out -- but -- but whatever that power is, which must be there, why doesn't that work to solve your problem?              What they are doing is very important.   There are quite a few people in this country who aren't even in the government, and what they do is very important and they are very busy.                   And so if there is something in these rules that allows people to bring suits without any factual foundation, even though the -- the complaint says there is --              I'll bet those people are being harassed --                And the reason you can't make this argument under 26(b)(2)(C) is?                The judge there is supposed to weigh burdens versus desirability of going forward. And so why don't you make this argument right at that point?   If you are right you win; if not, you lose.                 And that's also true, I guess, of complaints, and every other legal question.
07-10374 +++$+++                 Is there something you add -- you add to your statement of your rule?                 A neutral rule not related to substance, but related to the administration of the courts?               Don't just be agreeable to be agreeable.   Do cases actually say that?                 They are saying -- they are also saying there is a neutral reason.                    The neutral reason is the State sees there are just too many cases in which prisoners are suing correctional officials. So then they say:                Here's what we are going to do about it.   First, under State law, we will wipe out all the suits and give them instead an action against the State.      But we know there are still some Federal cases about the same thing.                       So what we are going to do is we are going to say bring them in Federal court.    Why bring them in State court?                     So now we've dealt with our administrative problem. So that's their neutral administrative reason.   Now, people would like to bring 1983 actions still in State or Federal court.                 It may be more convenient.    They get attorneys' fees, and the attorneys' fees you don't get under the State law.                          So why isn't -- or why is -- I guess that's the question for me:   Is this an adequate, neutral, administrative reason or not?              Well, forget all of the characterizations.      If we could look into the motive, maybe we would have a different view.                      But all we have is the statute on the books.              And, as in many cases, the people who are charged with defending those statutes think of very good reasons which are very plausible that could have motivated the people involved, and they have come up with the one that you have heard.                  Now, what's -- what's wrong with that one?             The reason is, you see, there are so many cases in which the person is suing -- the prisoner is suing the prison official that our courts are clogged.      So what we are going to do is: One, give the prisoners a good remedy under State law in a different court; and, two, close our doors to the comparable Federal case.
07-10441 +++$+++ 
07-1059 +++$+++               I can imagine you could have a grain mill and they have lots and lots of grain absolute identical one to the other.                     And the farmer takes his grain up and they operate on it, and then he drives away with the grain, milled.                      Now, it may make no difference to anybody whether the identical molecules are the same; and I think in such a case you'd say they are processing it; they are not buying and selling it.               You are saying if we have that, in fact, if the -- if the exact situation, if some farmers up in North Dakota send their grain just to be milled -- it's their grain -- up in Canada, and they come back, and it -- you know, it may not be the identical molecule, but it's identically the same; they have done this for 100 years -- now suddenly this -- the Commerce Department is going to say, that's a sale, and the antidumping statutes apply?               Well, would it or not?               I agree with you, and I just wonder, what I would like to know, is if any businessman involved in any of these or related things before this decision of the Commerce Department would have thought that that is how the Commerce Department would have treated such a transaction?               I don't know.   I'm asking -- the question is the same as the last case, to me:     Not whether they could have done it; sure they could have done it.       My question is based on my question of whether they had a rule that any reasonable person would have thought that is how they treated it --               Because after all, you have three precedents in related areas, not the direct area but in related areas, that suggest that they wouldn't have treated the millers that way.               You know what, I'm thinking of those things, they're something called "tollers."                     I don't know exactly what tollers are.                   They seem to be like people who give haircuts.             They're sort of servicers of some kind.       They're talking about tollers and -- and subcontractors.         And that is a related area.              What -- what do we do about the question that is bothering me?                Maybe at some point -- maybe it's not a relevant question -- but I will assume for the sake of argument Commerce does have the power to classify it either way. What is bothering me, and maybe that's not in this case, is that as the -- as your brother lawyer just said, this statute has been around for 90 years. There has been trillions of dollars worth of foreign commerce during that time.         Yet I don't find cited here any instance in which Commerce ever before said that when you have title to a good, and you send it abroad, for even a big change in it, and then it comes back, that that is a sale. Now, I might -- I don't know all the Commerce cases; maybe they did.             But what I found here is like a blank on that side, and on the other side the tolling cases, Florida Power & Light, the pizza case, to the point where I thought, if I was a lawyer advising a client, and that client said if I keep title to the good, am I home free, I would have to say, yes, you are.                Now that's the -- the question I want responded to in the legal context of, has Commerce made a significant change in its policy?                And I read -- at what page do I find all these cases?                Well, roughly.   I'll find it.   I will find it.                But I will see a lot of cases where --

07-1114 +++$+++ 
07-11191 +++$+++           What is the --          What is the theory of this? I understand in hearsay, which as we have just seen demonstrated, is very complicated, filled with all kinds of rules --          -- some of which I may recall and others of which I certainly don't. (Laughter.)          But the -- the Confrontation Clause, I would have thought, would have picked out the heart of that.             So we have Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Walter Raleigh says, "Bring in witnesses," which they wouldn't.             So why shouldn't we say what this clause is about is Sir Walter Raleigh?        Bring in the witnesses. Now, once you bring them in, the defendant can do what he wants.     He has had his chance to cross-examine them.   End of the matter, and leave the rest up to the hearsay law.        You could have -- you could have hearsay that is not prepared for testimony. There are all kinds of categories.              And suppose, in your case, this hearsay of business record or --        And how often will you say I understand it's admissible, but I would like as well to call the witness who prepared it.             Will you do that very often? Suppose you learn that that witness is -- is 4,000 miles away, so you say, I d like to call this witness, and you know perfectly well that it's going to be virtually impossible for that witness to be produced. What happens?        I'm trying to think of something that s hearsay, and --        -- and what I'm trying to figure out --        -- is will defense attorneys, if they have the right under the Constitution to insist that a lab technician be present, in cases where they happen to know that lab technician has left the job and is married and is reliving in a distant State, say okay, let's call her. And that way the prosecution really cannot present the case except at inordinate expense. And I'm concerned about that --        -- but I don't see quite how to deal with it, how much of a problem it is, and the impact on this particular situation.        I don't know except anecdotally, but Massachusetts seems to be having huge problems, reported anecdotally, with the --        Rouse -- is that --        The woman, Barbara -- Barbara Rouse?         And then there are conflicting reports in the newspapers, but I don't know.         What happens if the lab is -- is divided into four or five parts and there is several different machines and we have different people at different times using these different machines and performing different operations and each, at the end, certifies that the red light was on or it was this or it was that?       Now, do we have to call all those people?         Why not?         Each of them --         Each of them looked at a special part.    Each of them said --         -- that it was this or that, and in respect to each of those statements, it s this or that.    That is hearsay.         No, no, it's no confrontation because in this instance the hearsay prevents the confrontation.         Your answer to my question is, if a laboratory is so organized so that six or seven people perform different steps of the operation, if it is organized in that way, all of them must be brought?        You don't believe so, but you gave me an answer saying they did have to, so -- because you said they could organize differently.              So now explain to me why they don't.        Well, the reason that I ask is because floating in the back of my mind is -- is if -- (a) does the Confrontation Clause apply?        And if the answer to (a) is yes, then are there different kinds of implementation rules in different areas where there are other signs of security, where there are other reasons for thinking it's not bad testimony?           That line is not something that s necessarily workable, and -- but I brought it up to try to think about it.

07-1125 +++$+++                 I mean, could you have brought a claim that they didn't let the female students play hockey under your complaint?                 I mean, that's additional discrimination.                Didn't it have to be related to the particular facts?                And you talked about you wanted some additional discovery.                 What?   What is it that you could go to a district judge now and say, Judge, I have a basis here for asking for discovery on a different but related theory?              What words would you use? What would you write in that request?              The reason I ask is obviously if this case happens to be a case in which, because of the finding that there was no intentional discrimination and the school board behaved properly, that if that's the finding and therefore you have no claim under 1983 in respect to that, it becomes very theoretical to say that they went too far and said you might have no other 1983 claim because you would have some other 1983 claim, but we should dismiss this as improvidently granted and wait until somebody does this again.             Is that request here in the record?             Is that request here?             Do I have the request in the joint -- in the a -- do I have it in the appendix here?              So, we don't have it in front of us?              How do we know that the First Circuit wasn't just thinking about the facts of this case in front of it when it said that there's no 1983 action.   I mean, they didn't think there was no 1983 action for search and seizure.                     They must have had some idea of what the limitations of their saying no -- no -- no 1983 action was.          So why do we know that they went beyond what they had in front of them in this case? I'm not saying they didn't?            I am just wanting to know what we -- how we know that?              But you see, the question presented, I guess is -- I'm trying to get the exact words, but it's whether the Title IX replaces the -- what is it, it's whether -- I'm sorry.                  You have it right in front of you there.              You think they're -- they're referring to all of Title IX, no matter what the claims, whether they are overlapping or not?
07-1209 +++$+++                  That's in O'Neal.           It says that, but most of the court joined and the reason it says it is it just confuses everybody, at least me, to talk about "burden" in this context.                       I think if O'Neal is right, it says what this is, is not involving a jury, not involving -- it's just what Justice Alito says, and following that, what you have, you say to the judge, "Judge, your job is to decide this.                       Decide.   Decide whether you think that the one side -- whether there is error or whether the error is harmless or whether it isn't.   Decide it." Now, it could be in a rare instance the judge just can't decide.           He's in grave doubt.               And so what we are talking about is what to do in that -- what should be a very, very rare instance. Now, when I read this case, I thought the Veterans Affairs is absolutely common sense on this.                     It says, well, when you really don't know what to do, Judge, if the veteran got no notice at all, then probably the error was harmful.                But if he got the basic notice, and all that's at issue is who should produce what or whether he thinks that he didn't know that he's supposed to produce a lot of information, well, there, it would be pretty rare that it was harmful.                   So then you'd better say to him, veteran, why did this hurt you? That's all common sense, and it seemed to me that that's what the Veterans Court was saying and then the Federal Circuit unfortunately, like I might have done, too, got it all mixed up with this burden of proof language.   Now, you tell me, legally is that result which I am talking about sensible, and if so, how do I get there legally?                 I'm not criticizing you for that.   I'm not -- it's not a criticism.                  I'm just really trying to figure out to get to what I see as common sense legally.               The theory is he didn't know anything about this, got no notice whatsoever, so he didn't know that he's supposed to produce more information or he'll lose.          That's the theory.               But if you connect it by saying normally a veteran who isn't that knowledgeable -- not everybody is a genius in law -- when he doesn't get a notice that tells him you got to produce something more or you lose, he might forget to produce something more.   That's the theory.              Which is fine.         If I get that record and if it is the way you describe, I'm not in grave doubt.   No problem.           The record's the way you described it, she knew everything she was supposed to know, so there's no harmful error, okay?                   We are only talking about cases where there is real doubt in the judge's mind about whether this failure of the agency did or did not hurt the woman or man.                   Now, when in doubt, we have the Veterans Court telling us the best way to administer this stuff is when they get no notice at all, and you are really in doubt, judge, you don't know if it was harmful or not, here's what you do: Assume it was harmful.        They're the ones who know.       I don't know.             Suppose then we look at our rule, we read the first paragraph, what this court said, and we all held it, and therefore, we say, those are the cases we're talking about, where you are in doubt, and when you are in doubt, go proceed as the Veterans Court told you in terms of who has to show what.
07-1216 +++$+++                But -- but the -- the problem that I am having at the moment is that they did -- from your point of view, is that they -- the other side listed 28 cases in which they said the Oregon courts have followed this rule that the instruction has to be good as a whole. Now, I have looked up those 28 cases, and they do -- they do say that.              They do say it, or they imply it, or they apply it.              They are not completely on point, but they are not completely out of point, either. And -- and so I suppose what happened is that the judge there just looked at this instruction on 32(a).                     It looks like sort of it's all together.                     It really does look like it's all together, the (1) and the (2).                        And he ran his eye down the page and he said, well, here are two other ways in which it's no good, and so that's the end of it.     You can't raise your objection.                   Maybe you should have had four instructions instead of one, but you did just have one. And under Oregon law, unless every part of it is right, the judge is correct in not giving it, even if he never mentions the other part.                      And that 28 -- it does seem as if that's what those 28 cases do say.                      So what do we say about that?               Well, I mean -- please, I -- I don't want to appear skeptical, but I am.                     And -- and that's because I have looked up in some of those cases, and then I sort of looked at the -- which doesn't -- most of them don't give you the instructions, so it's a little hard to say.        But then I looked on page 32(a) of this appendix and looked at what your instructions looked like. And -- and if I were sitting there as a judge, I would think, well, gee, that looks like a single thing there.     They have it indented, and they have a (1) and a (2), and it just looks like it's one ball of wax.   So can I really fault this Oregon court for just doing what I said?              Well, they had some other handbook that says beware of that.              Because you are going to run into this rule that says if there is any part of a single instruction that is wrong, goodbye, even if the trial judge never mentioned it.              I mean, it would be pretty odd.     Did the person who wrote that read these 28 cases or some share thereof?         And if you were going to do that -- it wasn't you, I know -- why -- why wouldn't you just, if you have one instruction, copy the -- the model instruction?     Then you won't make errors in the other parts.              True, but you could add that to the pattern.              I'm not speaking of this from the point of view -- I mean I -- when I read that petition for cert, I thought this is a run- around, and I'm not sure that I think that now.                      That is, the reason is because I put myself in the position of not the trial judge.   The person to put yourself in the position of is the Oregon Supreme Court justice.                 And what he is doing is he's reading that instruction.                 And -- and what can you say in response to what -- what he might have thought? He knows this rule.              The rule is if the instruction is -- is unfavorable in any part, if it's wrong, you are out.              He knows that rule, because there have been a lot of cases on it.                     And then he reads your instruction, and as I looked carefully -- I didn't know this the first time when it was here, but he said because it's right in paragraph 1 -- I mean it's wrong in paragraph 1, where he was wrong -- I don't have to go to the rest of it.              Now we send it back, so he says:   Okay, now I've got to go to the rest of it.                 The best you have come up with -- and I think you have researched this pretty thoroughly -- and the best you have come up with to find a case where they didn't apply the rule is that George case, right?    "George," I think, is the name of it. And there, there is an alternative ground which is that the judge had to -- had to give the instruction himself, and it's a criminal case.                  And we Shepardized it and it has only been cited twice.                  And -- and so I'm slightly at sea, to tell you the truth.                  And -- and what is the standard I'm supposed to use to decide whether that State ground is adequate as a matter of Federal law or not?              The State interest in the rule in general, I take it, is to require the lawyers, if they are going to object to the instructions that the judge is going to give, to produce an instruction that is a correct instruction of the law.                      That's -- that's why, I guess, they have this rule.              And -- and you'd better get it right, because if you don't get it right, you're going to lose your ability to claim that the judge was wrong in refusing to give any part of it. Now, if that's the reason they have that rule, that would seem to apply as much in this case as in any other case.      Why wouldn't it?              What is your response to the Chief Justice's suggestion that maybe we should reach the issue of due process on the amount?              I mean I will tell you my subjective reaction going through these 38 cases is they are not quite in point, but they really take away the idea of the bad faith, particularly because the first time what the judge said, which I didn't understand its significance then, but the judge said:                  Well, since the first part of that paragraph was in -- was in error anyway, I don't have to reach the question of whether there were other mistakes under State law in the rest of the instruction.   They did say that the first time, I think.
07-1223 +++$+++               All right.           So I'm trying to figure out how the statute works.              And it seems to me that the way it's supposed to work -- have you read, by the way, the facts of the case for December in Bell v. Cohen? No?   Okay.   Forget that.         I was going to shorthand that because it's similar to the hypothetical I'm thinking of. What happens is that the -- the State court now says, okay, I assume all the facts in your favor and you don't prevail.      All right.            Now, he goes into Federal court and he has some new facts.                  Now, either they are such that they transform the claim and it's a new claim.    I mean, in that case there is an argument for that, maybe not in yours, or they aren't.                  Now, if they aren't, then what he is supposed to do, the judge, is go look and decide on the basis of what they presented to the State.          That's the end of it. Now, if they are, he is supposed to exhaust. You go back, you exhaust this new claim like any other new claim, and if the State bars it, then you go and see if there was cause and prejudice.                  And that's how it's supposed to work.     And if there was cause and prejudice, then you have the hearing.            Okay?        That's how it's supposed to work factually. I have no idea if that's what went on here, but if it -- it didn't seem to me -- there was some confusion about whether the procedures are adequate in the State.    Then there is some other thing that this might be the same claim.          I mean, I don't see how we get to the question we took this case to decide, frankly, without knowing what the basis was and whether it was correct for the district court to give him any hearing at all.              That's the first step.       The first step, I'd go and see -- but at any rate, you go ahead.              Well, why wouldn't you say right off the bat, new claim, go present it to the State court, and exhausts it?              Why not?              No, no, no.      Suppose we have -- that's what I want, not these facts, but I want the facts where really, he couldn't have discovered this, because the first time that the district attorney opened his files for the Brady claim was 140 days after. So we now have some totally new, which he couldn't have gotten; no one disputes it.           Where, that kind of thing -- I think he would have to present it to the State court, wouldn't he?              Well, you must have been assuming then that the State would not give that person a -- a new opportunity to consider the new evidence.              Suppose it were really new.              Yes, but so is it in Tennessee, and in Tennessee there is an exception where you could bring the thing up because you couldn't possibly have gotten over it.              So in Virginia a person discovers for the first time, 140 days later looks at the D.A.'s files, and discovers something that shows the whole trial was a farce -- I mean, something unbelievable, and there is no way for the person under Virginia law to bring that up in a State court?               I might say the new claim -- okay, so it's a new claim.                I don't know if yours is, by the way, but suppose it's a new claim.                   Then what you ought to do is go back to the State court and exhaust. So now what you show is that that's futile. Now we get to your question before us. Okay.     So it's an imaginary case.                It's less imaginary in December than here.          But, anyway, the -- the -- you get back to the State court.               Now, what is supposed to happen? At that point I guess the statute leaves the judge free to develop the facts.                  It doesn't say you can't.     Okay.   So then you do it. Now we have the question, which when we took this we thought we could reach, but I don't know if we can -- now we have the question:                  When the judge makes the decision on the basis of those facts, if they have never developed any of this in State court, fine.                   Then have -- then just do it.         If it is a regular case, don't defer it. But suppose some of the things have been in State court related to this but not others.              Now what do we do?              I mean that's not an obvious answer to that one.              What it's going to do is it's going to be finding facts on the basis of certain evidence.   And what you will have gotten your new claim granted on is the fact that you found some new evidence that's very significant, and you couldn't possibly have found it before. Now what do we do?              Do we defer in part; do we defer -- I mean now what does the district judge do?
07-1239 +++$+++                 Suppose you have to do it. Given all your work so far, how long would it take?                  You had several months already, so how long?                  When could you do it by?                So we're talking about two months.             That's exactly what Justice Kennedy started to ask.               I mean, I said why doesn't this thing go away after two months.               I mean, you've done it anyway, and Justice Kennedy said because you want a holding from the Court that will help you in other cases because you think what the court below did here was wrong.    And you said "three reasons," and you got out the first one, and I would like to hear the other two.             Well, I wouldn't -- look, you have an EIS for the reason that the agency itself, once it reads it, might decide to do something else. That's the whole point of an EIS.                 So if the agency goes ahead with the action before reading the EIS, it becomes committed to that course of action, and the chances that the EIS will lead it to back up are the same as the chances that any big agency will back up once it's committed to a course, namely a lot lower.                 And that I always thought was the whole harm that the EIS is there to stop.
07-1309 +++$+++               Could you try something out in your mind, and maybe you can't react to it.                    I'm trying to figure out how the structure requirement, what to say, and a thought was occurring to me which I am not wedded to, I would like some reactions to it:                    Is to say that there is a structure means that among this association of people there must be rules, understandings, or behavior that tend to keep the association together over time, other than those which would be essential to allow them to commit the particular crimes at issue.              Well, I know, but I'm trying to work out in my mind, is that a sensible thing to say?     The trouble with the word "structure" is everything in the universe has a structure, and so it's awfully vague?     I'm trying to make it a little bit more specific.              That isn't what I said.      I said:     Rules, understandings, forms of behavior that tend to keep the association together over time, other than those rules, understandings and associations and behaviors that would be necessary -- "necessary" meant strongly -- to commit the particular crimes at issue.              Yes.
07-1315 +++$+++               Well, they didn't.       But what we're going to discover, I suspect, when we actually dig into this record, which is pretty extensive, are two things.          The first is the California Court of Appeals does not seem to have dealt with the particular issue in front of us.               They talked about a due process issue at the end of their paragraph, they have talked about things that are close to it, but they nowhere say expressly how they are deciding the question of whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel for the reason that he didn't put on this insanity defense.   That's going to be our first problem. Then I looked to see, I got the record out to see, if he raised it, and he didn't.                 So we have the fact that they didn't talk about it, and then we have the fact that of course the Supreme Court of California says just one word, "Denied." Then when we discover round two in the Ninth Circuit, we are going to discover some language which says:   We are not relying on this rule, there is no such rule, as a rule of you have to make a defense as a last resort.   Here's what they say.               Instead of that we say, forget about that, we were wrong the first time, we assume.   "Where the State court has provided an adjudication on the merits, that is, it did say denied, but has not explained its underlying reasoning or held an evidentiary hearing, we conduct an independent review of the record to determine the State court's final resolution of the case, whether it was reasonable or unreasonable." So they say:          We did conduct that record independent review.       And our conclusion is that it was unreasonable, okay?       Nothing to do with any special rule here or anything.     We just think it was unreasonable. All right; now, what are we supposed to do with this?               What is that deference going to be?     I take it what it would be is that the person, the defendant, would have in his petition -- which we don't actually have -- would have said the facts are thus and so, and since they had no hearing, they would have to take those facts as being thus and so.             And then we would have to say, was it unreasonable of them on the facts as they might have taken them most favorable to the defendant. Is that what we're supposed to do?                 Is it unreasonable of them to conclude for the State's favor in light of reading these facts as most possible favorable for the defendant?   Is that what we should do?             Yes.             Then we have to reach this hearing issue because we have to say, insofar as the hearing reached a different result, we should ignore it for the reason that the statute tells us to consider the reasonableness of the State court's decision in light of the facts on the record before it.             So we have to reach a huge number of issues which we've never decided.              Well, then how are we supposed to do it?      That's why I raised it.             You keep saying 29 years. Is it 29 years or is that just a misprint --
07-1356 +++$+++ 
07-1372 +++$+++              But they don't say that -- there is nothing in the Resolution and nothing in the -- does anything in the Court's opinion or the Resolution say that the claims are valid?              We all know they have claims.   They have been making claims.                 Is there anything in any document I have that says the claims are valid claims?   Maybe they are valid, and maybe they are not.             Of course, they think they are valid.             So -- so since you have normally one group thinks they are valid; another group thinks they are invalid.         Well, here we are.           Let them fight it out. And all we can say is that this Resolution of the Apology doesn't really say who's right.                     And if Hawaii wants to give some more money, or whatever they want to do, to the Native Hawaiians, that's their affair.   What's the -- what's the problem?             Could the Hawaiian Legislature pass a law saying that the Native Hawaiians have claims?    Those claims, because of the Federal 1950 -- whatever it is -- are not valid any more.                     But that was pretty unfair to them.           And, therefore, what we think we should do is the following.                     And then they pass a whole lot of things that they think would be appropriate to do in light of what I just said.                     What stops that?
07-1410 +++$+++ 
07-1428 +++$+++              A city can in fact choose a test simply because there will be more minority people who will in fact end up in the positions, that's your view?              You needn't do anything else?   I mean, that is your answer to Justice Kennedy?              I want to know is that your answer to Justice Kennedy or not?              The answer is yes.              If that's so, what's the difference here?   The most that you're saying is the worst that could have happened here; the worst that could have happened is that some experts told them, this test -- by the way, test one is -- is even worse than in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical.               It's a test that probably discriminates negatively against minorities. So if you admit he could do it even if the test didn't discriminate negatively against minorities, namely test -- in his case, why can't you do it triply, in the case where there's evidence that they did discriminate, the test does discriminate against minorities?              If you got to that, then I have -- I'd like one follow-up, and that's it. (Laughter.)              What do you do if there is not a liability in question?            Suppose a school district deliberately, to obtain greater racial diversities in the schools draws district boundaries in a particular way among neighborhoods or plans a construction program. Then suppose having done that, indeed having once drawn the boundaries, a group comes to the school district and says you can achieve greater diversity if you redraw the boundary.   You can achieve greater diversity if instead of building this school where the -- where the foundations are laid already, you build the school over here instead. Is that, in your view, different from your case?              It is?           How?              That's just what I'm doing exactly.               But I'm interested in the distinctions, not whether it's similar to Justice Thomas's or not.    I'm interested in the distinctions between this program -- I'll add one more if you want just this program, an employer --               And the difference between that and drawing the school district boundary, which takes from the individual children who live in that neighborhood the right to go to this school, which they think is a better one, and sends them to that school, which they think is a worse one, the difference between changing that boundary and changing the exam is what?              What do you think of an employer who does the following?                 He advertises a job. Everyone comes in and applies.                He says May 1 is the deadline.     When he sees the applicants, he thinks, I'd prefer more diversity.         And solely because he lacks diversity among women, minorities, and whatever, he says, you know, I'm going to extend the deadline 2 months, and I hope I'll get a few more minority or female applicants. Now, what's his reason?                     He wants more diversity in the workforce.              Now, in your opinion, does the Constitution permit that extension?                Do you -- I'm still back on -- a university decides that tenure requirements lead to fewer women professors, so they say as an experiment what we would like to do is not have them for a couple of years; see what happens.             On your view is that unconstitutional?    Because, after all, it will certainly mean that certain majority race assistant professors have now lost the promotion they otherwise would have.                That it's unconstitutional?                Yes.                It would not be unconstitutional?                And what about --             All right.       Oh, oh.             But what we are doing is not giving the promotions to the assistant professors who otherwise would have job security.             Oh, so.             It's the result -- it's that you identify the person that makes your -- so in Texas, for example, they take the top 10 percent of all the high school graduates and put them in the university.    Now, suppose they just decided, you know what we want to do?      The top 5 percent.              We want to see how that works.    And, of course, then there are people who in fact would have gotten into the university -- and perhaps we can imagine a majority of the majority race -- and now they don't.        Can Texas do that?              That was not my objective.              I want to test out just what it is about this case.              Well, you said no.        Can Texas do that or not?              Yes.              Okay.       And the difference here precisely is what?               But in your -- in my example, to go back, the thing you've identified, it seems to me, is Texas couldn't do this.                 It couldn't look at the class that they're going to choose with the 10 percent and say, you know, there are not enough minorities, I think we'll go to 15 percent this year.               It could not.       And moreover, in the case of the tenure, what the school couldn't do is it couldn't say, looking over at the present tenured faculty and those who were just ready for promotion and who in all probability will be, we're going to go to the non-tenure system this year.                  We're going to go to the non-tenure system this year.              That they couldn't do that. And again you that say the ordinary employer across America who announces a deadline for getting in applications cannot, once it sees those applications, say, you know, there are not enough minorities.                  I want to extend the deadline.              All right.       And therefore this is a very far-reaching decision.

07-1601 +++$+++                  Well, we don't suppose that that cost -- that single thing cost $2 million, and you will have to hire that $2 million machine even if there is one drop.     So for the cost of that machine it couldn't matter if your client put in one drop and nobody else put in any, or the others put in 40 billion drops.   Can you allocate it?             It would seem fair to allocate it, but I guess maybe in the restatement there is some law somewhere saying you can't, because it's just one single cost that takes place regardless. What's the state of the law on that?                      How do you --
07-208 +++$+++ 
07-21 +++$+++               You don't really -- I mean, that's what I wonder if there is no such evidence.                    How could you get evidence?          It used to be common maybe urban legends, but of political bosses voting whole graveyards of dead people.            All right.          Now, that would be almost impossible to catch, I think.                    Someone walks in, saying:     I'm Joe Smith.           He doesn't say:       I'm Joe Smith dead.     He says, I'm Joe Smith, and he signs something.     And the poll worker looks at it and the signature looks very weird. Well, what's the poll worker supposed to do? He's not going to go disrupt the election.                   And is there going to be a policeman there to follow this person home?   Of course not. So that's their claim.                 Their claim is that we have a lot of anecdotes and there is a certain kind of fraud that you really just can't catch at the poll.              Now, what's your response to that?     Because that's their argument on the other side.              I know there are arguments on both sides.    But at the heart of this is what was Judge Posner's claim and others that this isn't the kind of fraud that you can just dismiss and say it never happens because the person would walk into the poll later and try to vote.        What they are talking about is what Justice Scalia was talking about, and I'm simply trying to focus your answer on that part of the question.              Well, they say that's because you can't catch it.              How would you catch it, which is my question.
07-210 +++$+++ 
07-214 +++$+++                I must be just missing something here.     Tell me what I'm missing.                  What about the definition of "claim"?            It says a claim includes a request under a contract for money or property, and the request is made to the contractor if the United States provides any -- any of the money. Is there an issue here as to whether some of the money provided -- are you saying there was no money provided by the United States or maybe there was no money provided?               Yes.               Well -- so why doesn't that end it?   Why doesn't -- how do you win, then, given the language I just read?               "Claim."        And there has to be a claim.              That's right, that's right.              But that's why the definition -- it seems to me at the moment -- that's why I'd like your view -- that the language is perfectly ambiguous, the language of "knowingly makes a false statement to get a false claim paid." Now, the "false claim" is the claim that they made to the contractor, because that's the definition.    And you are saying:               Well, they made this statement to get a false claim paid by the government. Now, you could read those words "paid by the government" to say "and there has to be a causal connection," which is what you're saying, that you have to make the false statement, make the claim, and that led the government to pay. But you could also say it's paid by the government when the money to pay it comes out of government funds, because it was paid by the government even though the government gave the money to build the school 100 years ago.        But it's there in the bank account, and then the contractor took the money from the bank account that the government put in and paid it.                In such a case, linguistically, you can say it's paid by the government.              It was a false claim. That's there.              Well, it doesn't say that. It says it was a false claim, which it was.                  It's false, and it is a claim to the general.                  And was it paid by the government?    Yes.      It was paid by the government, even though everything you said is true, because the money to pay it came from government funds.                  So that's why I'm having a problem.            I can read those words "paid by the government" either way.              That's true.
07-219 +++$+++               Do you want to get -- looking at this case of Lake Shore, as I read -- as I read that case, I'm thinking that they looked back to the admiralty case, but they're saying this isn't an admiralty rule.    It's a Federal rule.                   And the Federal rule is that to make the corporation liable for punitives in the absence of bad conduct by anyone in the corporation but for the lower executive, you can't do it. But if it were a higher executive, the president and general manager or, in his absence, the vice president in his place, then you could. So they are distinguishing among levels of corporate officials.      Now that seems to be the Federal rule, right?             All right.       Now, what happens to that Federal rule?             One thing we know happened to it is that time passed; Erie v. Thompkins came along; and most of the relevant cases left the Federal courts or Federal law and were decided under State law. Was there anything left in the Federal system besides admiralty where this Federal rule might apply; and, if so, what happened to it?             Well, what happened?         And the reason I think I'd like to know is because it seems to me it makes a difference from the point of view of stare decisis whether the Federal rule, as Federal rule, has always stayed the same or the Federal rule has eroded so that in place X and Y it disappears, remaining only in admirality, in which case you have a genuine outlier. And I don't know what the history is.             I know.          That's beside the point to my question.               But the -- I mean, the obvious kind of thing would to be say that the standard would depend upon the reprehensibility of the conduct of the officer of the corporation, including the captain, if you lost on that. And where we said roughly before zero to 10 -- and you are quite right that this is a huge amount of money -- you'd say zero to five, up to five times.                       I mean that would be rough and ready.                       But the idea would be to impose enormous deterrence upon large firms involved in your industry that you are representing not to make certain the officers on the ship behave in a reprehensible way. It's crude, but I mean that's the kind of thing that we said in the due-process cases.                 Then why wouldn't you --                 Why wouldn't you --                 You're going to say -- you're going to hear in two seconds -- they're going to say this is the company that makes the most amazing profit, et cetera.      And so you're trying to deter them. So we know what, you know -- so, what do you say to that?
07-290 +++$+++               Could you go back to the --              I just wondered if you could say in a minute.         One possibility is that the amendment gives nothing more than a right to the State to raise a militia.       A second possibility is that it gives an individual right to a person, but for the purpose of allowing people to have guns to form a militia.     Assume the second.           If you assume the second, I wanted you to respond if you -- unless you have done so fully already, to what was the Chief Justice's question of why, on the second assumption, this ban on handguns, not the other part, of the District of Columbia, a total ban, why is that a reasonable regulation viewed in terms of the purposes as I described them?
07-308 +++$+++                  Can you explain one thing to me?   I take it that they -- everybody says they went through all the right IRS hoops to get back three years' worth of damages, i.e., they get their payments back and they get interest.                 Now, what they want is they want three years before that.                 And they're too late under Title 26.   So what you're saying is, one, you can't get any interest and, two, you can't get your money back at all.                 I'm saying for three years they're home-free.      They get their payment back and they get their interest.       Now let's go to the three preceding years.   I'm a little confused about that because I can't work out -- I suppose that the government is saying: You get nothing, you don't get your money back, and you don't get your interest.           Or is the government saying: You get your money back; you just don't get the interest?     Which is it?        And I don't see how it could be the latter.               Okay.             Right.           Is the government's view that the money that they are seeking here, if you look at 7422, that it falls within the language of any Internal Revenue tax alleged to be erroneously or illegally assessed or the language "any sum alleged to have been in any manner wrongfully collected," or both?             So when I decide this case, I should forget the words "any sum"?             But it means that if, in fact, it is not within the scope of the word "tax," then it is not within "any sum"?             In Enochs -- she is quite right, your opposing lawyer -- it says the exaction is merely in the guise of a tax.              And when it says it is within the guise of a tax, then it doesn't fall within the Tax Injunction Act. And there it says if it is clear that under no circumstances could the government ultimately prevail, the central purpose of the Tax Injunction Act is inapplicable.     And then it's just in the guise of a tax.    And that, she says, is the test we should apply here.     So that's where I think Justice Ginsburg began. What is your specific response to that?
07-312 +++$+++               I don't understand that. If it's never confirmed, then I guess the tax is okay, isn't it?              But so what?      Isn't that -- I mean, I assume that's totally illegal, that you get -- I thought we're talking about this provision where everybody agrees that it has to be under a plan confirmed under section 1129.              So if there's no plan confirmed, I don't know how you would fall within this exemption.              Fine.      If it's your point exactly, then I guess I must agree with that.                 I'll hear from the other side.      Except I thought your point was it makes it difference whether the transfer takes place before the plan is confirmed or after.                  So I may be just confused about that.              Oh, no, I'm asking you this.   You then concede -- let me for my own point of view; forget what the -- maybe I'm confused about the facts or maybe I'm not.        But let's suppose there is a plan and it is confirmed.          The transfer, however, took place a month earlier where a private group of creditors came together, every creditor, with the debtor and they worked out a sale tomorrow, and they transferred the assets tomorrow.   Four months later, the plan that includes every word of that goes before the bankruptcy judge, the bankruptcy judge thoroughly understands the situation, and he says:        I confirm the plan. Now, under those -- in that circumstance, I guess you now are -- are you prepared to concede that Florida cannot tax?              Of course not.    So then -- then the fact that there is no plan seems to me irrelevant, that situation, from the present case. So now let's look at this case, where there is a plan and it is confirmed.              My question, going back to what I thought the facts are, is this:               Imagine the situation I've just described -- thorough investigation later by the bankruptcy judge; plan including it is confirmed.   And you say if the transfer took place first you can assert your tax, but if the transfer took place second, after the plan, you can't. And my question, if I'm right on my assumption, is I'd like you to provide a reason why any human being, a reasonable human being, would want to make that distinction? Why would anyone want to say we want to give all the money to the creditors and not let Florida get some if it takes place, the transfer, after the confirmation, but would think differently about it and would want Florida to get some if the transfer takes place before the confirmation, which confirmation describes everything in depth, is thoroughly investigated, et cetera?         What reason could there be for such a distinction? Well, two things,              I'm not speaking of the language for the moment.          I want you to forget about the language and assume the language is ambiguous.             That's a different question.      My question is, assuming that the language is ambiguous, as every lower court has found, assuming that, however, is there any reason why a reasonable human being would make this distinction? That's my question.      And there may be an answer, but I want to know what answer is.              I would appreciate an answer to the question.               That's the problem?         If that's the problem, I thought that there had to be a filing for bankruptcy before any of this kicks in.               Okay.      Then the answer can't be you could go back 50 years.                    The answer would have to be you go back until the filing for bankruptcy.              What?      That's what I want to know.    And I'll add a qualification.                I'd say I would read into this a context, and the context is the whole section that gives the exemption from the State law only kicks in when you file for bankruptcy. So, I -- now, it's my question.                  I guess I could make the hypothetical the the way I want to make it, and the way I want to make it is that this section applies once it kicks in, the bankruptcy filing, and it does not distinguish between the pre- and the post-confirmation, you know, where the confirmation takes place after the transfer or the transfer after the confirmation. You're arguing to the contrary.                  And what I want to know is what reason there is?                     Do I have to repeat the question?              What is the reason?        That's what I want you to focus on, for making that distinction.              That's all I can say.              Why can't you just say that?    Why can't you say, you want to record this taxation, pay the tax.        And when you come in later, because it was confirmed, show us the paper.                 We'll give you the money back. How does that interfere with -- with anything?              Why is it an administrative burden?    The burden is entirely on the people who want their money back.    They come in.              They file a piece of paper.    It says Federal bankruptcy judge signed, plan confirmed, and it would take, I guess, a few minutes to read through it to see they're telling the truth, which you always have the problem in a tax, and then you give them their money back.                Of course, you can't file it if they don't tell the State.                 So if they're not going to tell you, they're not going to have their transfer recorded. I mean, look, we're going into this, and on the other side, of course, there is the following consideration:   That there are creditors who are owed a lot of money; and all these creditors are in a room; and they think, if I can sell these assets tomorrow, I'm going to get a lot more money than I will if I have to wait for six months.        That's why we want to go through with this. Now isn't that an important bankruptcy interest, to make the creditors more whole?               It's on page 38, the last line, the next to the last line.               The red brief.               Yes.               No, no.          I'm sorry. Doesn't the rejection have to take place prior to the plan being confirmed?               Does it or doesn't it? Prior to in your opinion or not prior to?              I'm sorry.      I don't understand how that would work.              I have a contract with Boeing for $500 million.         I decide to reject it. Now if that breach doesn't occur until the plan is confirmed, how does the trust -- how does bankruptcy judge know how to treat Boeing as a creditor?              I understand that.        But I'm sorry -- doesn't the plan which its confirmed have a list of the creditors and how they are treated?              All right.      How do we write the plan if, in fact, no breach has occurred and he hasn't become a creditor until the plan is, in fact, confirmed?
07-320 +++$+++ 
07-330 +++$+++                 What happens if it's just the converse case?      The same thing, I take it.                We have a government appeal.   The sentence was 10 years.                      The government thinks it should be 20. On appeal, the appellate court thinks the government is wrong, and moreover, the appellate court discovers an error:       It should have been one year.                    And you're saying, well, according to you, not only is the court of appeals helpless, but the district court is helpless.   So this person is in jail for nine years where he shouldn't have been.               That's your position here?                Well, that's a pretty tough position.   It -- it seems to me there could be errors -- and I guess if he's sentenced to death, it's the same. I mean, the -- the -- it's a pretty tough position, isn't it?   That there is no authority in the courts of appeals, or in the district court, or anywhere in the system to create -- to correct a serious error where a person could, in fact, be in prison for a long time contrary to the law.              How is it supposed to work in your system that we get those errors corrected?

07-440 +++$+++                Is there any law on that? Is there -- suppose there's an indictment and the defendant finds out about it; he's never arrested; nothing further happens; weeks pass.                     Now, is there any law that tells me -- it's an indictment, that's clear -- and is there any law that tells me, when he requests a counsel be appointed, when they have to do it?             So the answer is no.             What happens -- what happens if -- the part that's worrying and I don't know how people handle it -- a riot.             A big sit-in.       A big demonstration, 500 people arrested, they are brought down to the station, bail is posted the next day, the U.S. attorney or the D.A. thinks:               I'm going to indict the ringleaders, and the rest -- you know, the rest we are just going to let go; they will forfeit their bond. How is that handled?     How is it handled under your rule? How is that handled generally?             How should it be handled?             No.     No.      That's easy.             I mean -- I'm talking about the people who nobody ever intends to prosecute.                  What's going to happen, as I think happens quite often, they are brought to the station, they are arrested, they are released on bond, and then everybody forgets about it.             Or they're -- or the D.A. says, you know, forfeit -- like a traffic ticket or something -- forfeit your bond.              And I want to know how that's handled under your rule, how is it handled now, how is it handled in the -- discuss it, please.             Well, you see what I'm doing.   I'm trying to make it comparable.                  What happens there is that these 500 people brought down to the station, they are required to put up bail; they are given a warning because people might question them; they are given a warning; they are then released.                   And nothing further is heard.          Maybe three months later, they come in and they agree that they'll forfeit their bond. Now, that's what I'm wondering.                  That must happen, because I think there are lots of demonstrations; they occur sometimes.                   I suspect it happens.   How is it handled, if you know?
07-455 +++$+++                 General, that is -- my question would be the converse.               Suppose I agreed with you to this point hypothetically that, of course, there's a relationship here.             In this case, there's a relationship.    He wouldn't have lied if he -- if he hadn't had the explosives.           Suppose I accept that. Now, if I interpret the statute that way - there has to be a relationship, but including that - then what are the other cases you want to prosecute? In the other briefs they list every funny or comical or absurd example they can find; and so I don't believe you want to prosecute those, but tell me if you do.   And if there are some other ones, what are they?              Fine.      So suppose, in other words, if we -- if, hypothetically, I were to say, well, here there's a relationship; after all, it is a necessary condition for the lying that he was carrying explosives; and it is foreseeable that he would lie on his passport, because he was carrying explosives illegally.   So that's all you need. In other words, if that were the decision, you would say fine, that's the end of it.              No, it didn't facilitate it, but it caused it.              Well, if it didn't -- all right.   Would you be satisfied with a result that says, look, if this carrying of explosives is related to the felony in the sense that it is a necessary condition and foreseeable that a person would do such a thing, that's sufficient?
07-463 +++$+++                Standing itself, I mean, it's a little unusual.      Suppose -- I mean, Congress here has passed a statute and the statute specifically aims at a class of litigants.        And it says to the class of litigants, if you are a member of it, we are telling you what we want the agency to do and that is to promulgate a certain appeal procedure. Now, if you are a member of the class that frequently litigates and you frequently take advantage of that procedure, why aren't you heard as a litigant, at least enough for Article III?              And we know as far as prudential standing is concerned, Congress wanted to give you standing, so I think would it take care of that. Are you saying no matter -- that just normal litigants in the courts who reappear time and time again in certain kinds of cases, don't have standing to challenge a procedural rule, if Congress under Article III and Congress specifically tells them they can?               Let's imagine that Congress did, Congress did say:         By the way, lawyers who have handled 17 tort cases in the last year where the value has been more than $500,000 and who will sign an affidavit saying they intend to continue in that branch may appeal from the court's promulgation of the following general rule, dah, dah, dah.                       And that Constitution prohibits Congress from doing that?                 Right.          Those who -- fine, forget that, yeah.                 You mean Article III and at Westminster -- at Westminster, when Westminster, whatever they had, they must have had some procedural rules, and sometimes they had general procedural rules -- I don't know what the history is; I could look it up.   But I would be amazed if the lawyers at that time or the clients who had certain cases were not permitted to challenge those rules as contrary to some other rules. Do we know the answer to that?              No, no, no.     Generally. Because you have a special procedure, here's what you can generally challenge our rules.              Okay, then your answer is, if Congress says you can do it, have a general challenge to people who generally appear, your answer is if Congress says they could do it, Article III doesn't stop them?              Ah.    What's the answer to that different question?             Ah, but --             And I am pursuing this, but I'm actually having a hard time with this.                 Suppose -- suppose Congress passes a statute; the statute says every citizen of the United States has a right to receive notice of a certain set of Forest Service actions.   Everybody.      We want everybody who wants it to have notice. Now, if somebody really wants that notice and they don't get it, can they sue?             Yes.      Sorry.             In any case, I'm trying to make it look like FOIA.             That's just what I am trying to do, and you say yes, they probably could, at least if you are just supposed to get a piece of paper that says "Notice."      Now suppose Congress says, if you can show you are the kind of person who regularly asks and needs such notices, and if a regulation is promulgated interpreting this statute, you can challenge that reg prior to enforcement.               Now does that violate Article III?             Suppose they did this. Suppose they said each agency has the legal power to promulgate regs interpreting FOIA as to when you get the thing, and when you don't, and moreover people who are regular FOIA requesters can challenge those regs prior to enforcement; what about that one?              I am looking for a principle that is going to help me.
07-474 +++$+++               What about he didn't like him?   I'm the supervisor; I didn't like him.              All right.       Now, you say related.    If the truth is I don't like this person, good-bye, now, is that rational?                 When you say -- I mean, you know as much about the case now as I do -- not this case but, you know, that's all we know.                 Is that rational or not?             All right.       Now that seems to me to be the problem, that either -- going back to Justice Scalia's point, you're either going to say rational in these circumstances, which means you go into it whether the time sheet was this or whether it was that or the other; or you say, hey, it's always rational because he could have fired him because he doesn't like the person.    That's -- and I don't see some intermediate step there. To put the question differently, every government has a, State and Federal, has an administrative procedures act.               That forbids unreasonable, arbitrary action.               But why do they need that if the Constitution does it by itself?              I don't know if that's -- that's why I started this.            I read through, at least briefly, the circuit cases in this area.                  I was trying to figure it out.     And it seemed to me that those circuit cases just really are finding some reason to dismiss the employee's claim, that they are not taking this seriously, that is -- I mean, I don't want to criticize them because I don't know the facts of the case; but I couldn't figure out a standard. And then I thought, well, the standard has to be the APA standard, and if it's -- I know that standard.   And the reason that you don't have a million cases under that standard is because States have civil service systems.              So it seemed to me that's the standard you want to apply.                You want to bring all those cases into Federal court, and I'm not sure they are doing it now, really, in practice.                     Now what's wrong with what I've just said?             No, but you could -- you could take sentiment -- I thought you could break the cases, for the most part, into two parts; one, what Justice Ginsburg said, and that's where the real reason is some kind of general characteristic, of a disfavored group.   The second is the instance where the -- where the body that's acting is a body whose business it is to classify.   That's zoning, taxation, and it means really classifying in fact, not some theoretical thing where you say, oh, well, they're classifying it employment because they put you in the class of such and such.                 But those two seem to me to handle the bulk of the cases, which, if I'm right about that, would leave your client out in the cold.   So I assume you'll tell me why I'm not right.
07-499 +++$+++               I am quite curious why -- I am curious, why did you answer Justice Alito's question "yes"?     I -- I would have thought that if you win this case, the Attorney General would still have tremendous leeway in deciding where, when, under what circumstances, the duress defense applied.                Why isn't that so?              If that's right, then why do you not -- why was your answer yes?
07-512 +++$+++                 So there is regulation involved there.      I mean, suppose you had no regulation at all involved.     Why couldn't you have a monopolist at the primary stage, say, ingot, and what that monopolist wants to do is to extend its power into the secondary stage, say, fabrication, in order to make it less likely that there would be a new entries to attack its primary monopoly?    That would -- suppose you have those circumstances?    Perhaps they would be rare, but if you have them, wouldn't that set forth a Section 2 violation?               Well, that's it -- I mean, now maybe you can get me off what I am thinking, but now it sounds that the answer to Justice Stevens's question is yes.   Now, I have, yes, overruled Judge Hand's opinion in Alcoa.    I always thought there were circumstances, whether true of Alcoa or not, where that did make out the claim, namely, the one I suggested. Well, it's quite a different battle if, in fact, the person whose injured, namely, the fabricator who is complaining, has a place to go, such as the FCC or the Alcoa regulatory agency, because under those circumstances, he has a place to complain that these prices are out of line. But if there is no place to go, well, I'm suddenly -- I'm a little hesitant to overturn Alcoa under those circumstances, and the reason the duty to deal doesn't deal with it is we could come into an existing world where duty or no duty, there have been independent fabricators who for a long time have bought their ingot from this monopolist.                Then I would say that shouldn't be the law.       The reason it shouldn't be the law is because that ingot may, by either withdrawing or, in fact, raising his price way above a competitive level and charging just no room to remain in business, is trying to drive out possible new entrants into the ingot stage of the business.        And the fabricators are a number one out there as possibilities to break down the monopolist in ingot. And if that is the motive, as shown by the behavior, there should be a section 2 claim.             If you want to argue that straight on the merits, what's the answer to that argument?              Just out of curiosity, is there a place where in this case the plaintiffs could go, a place which has a label "regulator" under it?              And that place is --              So we needn't reach the issue in this case?              Well, why -- why can't we just say Trinko is a case, as is this case, where there is a regulator?    So, in fact, if you, Mr. Plaintiff, are upset about this, and feel you are being very badly treated and squeezed out under circumstances where competition might be hurt as a result, then you go to the Commission, and you say:             "This is an unreasonable price. " All right? Now I thought Trinko was a case where that was involved.              But it -- it -- it said that the issue in that case was a duty to deal.                That's not the issue in this case.              And it was about Aspen, and whether you had a duty to deal.                And the Court said no, you don't have a special duty to deal. Here we are dealing with quite a different thing.     We are dealing with someone who has chosen to deal in the past, and they are setting a price such that the plaintiff thinks he is being squeezed out. Now I can't find anything in Trinko that tells me I can't say, we're at least not worried about this where there is a regulator that you can go and complain to.   And if that's so, I don't have to reach the question of whether Judge Hand is right or wrong. What's wrong with what I just said?
07-513 +++$+++              Why, if there is no negligence?    Why do you need to argue that and why do you argue that?    I mean doesn't there have to be at least negligence on somebody's part?             Well, either of those things are negligence or worse.             So what I didn't understand is why you would charge the police with anything or suppress a warrant where there was a mistake but no one was negligent or worse.                 But what you argued for --                 -- you said, it should be suppressed even if no one is negligent or worse.                  And I have trouble seeing why you're suppressing a warrant where no one does anything wrong at all.                 I mean, I don't know what the underlying law is here.              I mean -- I guess it's little weird, but what happens if the policeman arrests the wrong person, but it's nobody's fault?                    You know, the person was pretending to be his brother.              Or the mother said it's John and it's really Joe.          And so, the policeman wasn't at fault.   They arrest the wrong person.                    I guess that's happened in history --              -- but do they suppress things then?   I wouldn't think so --              -- but maybe they do.              But do we suppress?              We do not?           Okay.              So there's no reason then, if we don't suppress when there's no error in the part of the policeman, none, it was just a weird circumstance, then I don't understand why we would suppress here.   And nor do I understand why you have to argue this because I thought it's clear here that there is error, and it was negligently caused.                 There were four months that went by without anybody doing anything about this mistake.             Can I use 30 seconds of your eight minutes because I want some clarity on this.             Divide in your mind two separate things:   The nature of the bad conduct: is it negligent, reckless, deliberate; and the other question is who engaged in it -- a police department official or some other official? I thought this case was about the second question, but now I'm confused about the first question because I suppose a policeman, an arresting officer makes a negligent error.         He goes to the wrong house. And he never looks at the number; and he arrests, starts to arrest the wrong person:              Is the evidence suppressed? If the evidence isn't suppressed, frankly, I don't see why a clerical official should be held to a higher standard; but if the evidence is suppressed then quite possibly the clerical official should be held to the same standard.      So you've heard the government say well, the answer isn't clear; very often a negligent official -- a negligent officer would not have that evidence suppressed.        Well, what is it?              He was not.              I want to know if he is negligent.              Excuse me, because I think I'm getting a different view from the government.                All right.       So we've got this --
07-526 +++$+++                What about a poster that says "Give blood now."               They put up a poster that says "Give blood now."               It doesn't mean when it was printed.              Do you think -- do you think the meaning of that -- the words specifically that were added were "now under Federal jurisdiction."                  The word "recognized" was already in the statute.                  So, it looks like the "now" applies to "under Federal jurisdiction." Now, my law clerks, in doing research on this, came up with a number of instances where the tribe wasn't recognized until 1976.             I think that was true of something called the Stillaquamish Tribe.               And it's recognized in 1976, but then they go back and they say, well, was it under Federal jurisdiction in 1934?                     And that seems a rather loose term that includes the fact that you are under Federal jurisdiction if, for example, the Federal Government has a treaty with you that requires the Federal Government to do something.                     Suppose that's the right reading of this.       Then should we send this back?               Well, I'm saying I'm agreeing with you on the meaning.                The meaning is "now," but it's "now under Federal jurisdiction."                     So, there would be a question.      This tribe wasn't --               No.
07-542 +++$+++               Where -- where is it?           I mean, if you want to -- if you want to search, you can impound the car.   If you want to search, you can ask for consent, which you probably won't get.                    If you want to search, you can look in the window.                     There's no problem there.   It's just under the seat and in the glove compartment we're talking about.               If you have probable cause to think that there's evidence of a crime even in the glove compartment or underneath the seat, you can look at it without a warrant.             Why do you need this as well? You say we need this as well because the guy who's locked up in back of the squad car might take off the handcuffs, open the door, run out, and grab a gun from under the glove compartment.                That's a little thin. And then you say, well, the rule is it needs to be administrable.   And then I say, okay, the rule is administrable if you've got him locked up in the squad car and all you want to do is have a good snoop around, take it in and impound it.          That's administrable.               I got that point.   Are there many people, by the way, they arrest but they leave them standing outside the squad car?               I mean are we going to have one of these spectrum things?              Well, that's actually a serious point, maybe in your favor because it -- what was worrying me about this is, if you lose the case, there would be policemen who would then let dangerous people stay in the car so they could search it.               But you haven't made that argument, and, you know, that would be the --                No, nobody would.
07-543 +++$+++                Btu you -- what about -- I'm trying to work with this distinction where I agree with you that it's hard to see exactly what it is.                      But if I look at Bazemore, I think there we have a large number of employees.        And if you look at a complicated thing, a salary structure, earlier, you see that that salary structure systemically paid black people less than white people.      And at the time, for whatever reasons, there wasn't a statute -- we assume that that was lawful at the time.               Then later it turns out that they are keeping that salary structure, although not for racially motivated reasons.                       They are keeping it simply because that's what it was.                   And the Court says, you've taken that complex structure, and you are administering it now, and the administration of it now is what is unlawful. Then, look at your case.                      We had a complicated structure involving seniority, really.                     And part of that old seniority system was this rule which was legal at the time.         It is no longer legal. Now, we move that structure over until now, and we see we are administering the same complex structure today in the same kind of way that was at issue at Bazemore.      It's a complicated set of rules that you have to apply today in order to see who is entitled to what, just as they did that in Bazemore.                     So I began to think, doesn't that, on the key matter, look very much like Bazemore?       What is your response?
07-5439 +++$+++                 What are they?          That is, I was -- I can't find -- what should I read?                      Because I've read the studies.    I've read that Lancet study, which seemed to me the only referee for it said it wasn't any good.   And I've read the Zimmer study and I found in there an amazing sentence to me which says that The Netherlands Information Task Force concluded it is not possible to administer so much of it that a lethal effect is guaranteed.       They're talking about thiopental. So I'm left at sea.      I understand your contention.          You claim that this is somehow more painful than some other method.   But which?     And what's the evidence for that? What do I read to find it?              But that's what they're -- they're giving a three gram dose, I take it, and if -- or two grams or three grams; I thought it was three grams here.    And I ended up thinking of course there is a risk of human error.        There is a risk of human error generally where you're talking about the death penalty, and this may be one extra problem, one serious additional problem.      But the question here is can we say that there is a more serious problem here than with other execution methods?          I've read the studies.     What else should I read?              What do we do with the euthanasia -- instead of talking -- I looked; I found it more important to look at what they do with euthanasia than to look at what they do with animals, frankly, and I was therefore taken aback with the sentence I just read to you.   What am I supposed to do about that?             Well, what do we do about the point -- the point that the doctors or the nurses say it's unethical to help with an execution?                   I mean, if we are going to talk about the constitutionality of the death penalty per se, that isn't raised in this case.   And what the other side says is, well, you're just trying to do this by the back door, insist upon a procedure that can't be used.
07-544 +++$+++                  But you should have said "no" to the question, I think.               Because I thought the question -- whatever it was, you are saying that there isn't a reasonable likelihood that its error influenced the outcome.   You are not saying that?                 Yes.
07-552 +++$+++              You have a discovery be problem.    I don't see that it's a standing problem.                  And two things it reminds me of are, one very common, a financer takes an interest in receivables and he's going to have to collect them as receivables and there may be 50,000.    That could have the same kind of practical problems.    Or we had cases in the First Circuit you may or may not be aware of where somebody went around and had assignments for 50,000 cabbages that were delivered a day late in 50,000 box cars and each one was worth about $10.   Nobody figured a way out of that.              They had to pass a special statute. There was -- and so it seems to me you're better off than the cabbage people because have you two possible remedies:      One on discovery; you could ask the judge, Judge, see what the Communications Commission thinks.   It's called primary jurisdiction of the kind.               Or you could go to the FCC and you say, FCC, you got us into this. Now, you have some rules here that make some sense in terms of collection.               You have both those agency avenues open to you, not open to the cabbage people, and this doesn't seem a standing problem.                 Now, what's your response to that?              How is that different?              Just on that very point -- I need clarification on this.               How is that different than the case of the financer who takes accounts receivable, which is very common?                  You finance the accounts.     You take a secured interest in accounts receivable.              And there you might foreclose on the secured interests.                       Then you as the financer have to collect from everybody.                       How is your case different from that?              In the respect you were just talking about.              I know, but I mean, there may be many reasons for that.               I'm just saying it's a normal, practical problem, I believe, in the banking community.   I don't know.               Go back to my question, I'd like to get an answer to it.               In respect to the problem you were just mentioning, the discovery problem of counterclaims or those problems, is this case any different than the financing case I just mentioned?               No.
07-562 +++$+++               That's totally false, and in your view, that would be pre-empted, if Congress attempted to pre-empt a state law that says you cannot make a completely false statement of material fact --               --   if it's based on -- has something to do with smoking and health.               Well, I was trying to produce an -- I mean, it will build strong bodies eight ways. (Laughter.)              Excuse me.         The reason I think the plurality wrote this, I'm guessing, is that when you read through this statute it seems as if what Congress had in mind in the statute was not setting aside State law, which is tradition, about not making false statements, false and deceptive advertising law. It was concerned with a different thing.                     They said, to the cigarette companies:           You have to put on the label "Smoking is dangerous to your health."                     We don't want States telling you to put other things like that on the label, and we don't want States forbidding you to put a picture of the Marlboro man or Lauren Bacall with her cigarette.    We don't want States to tell you that you can't do that.     That would be focused on the object of the statute, which no one said had as its objective setting aside traditional unfair and deceptive advertising law.     I think that's the argument.              Well, why -- why would Congress -- I mean the difficulty that the other side raises here is just what Cipollone said.                 I can understand totally why Congress would not want 50 States telling cigarette companies what to say about health and smoking or taking off pictures of the Marlboro ad.                  I can understand that. What I can't understand is why Congress would want to get rid of, in this area, the traditional rule that advertising has to tell the truth. Now, what you said was you could end up with different applications of that in different States.                 Of course, every national advertiser faces that situation at the moment.    Everyone who advertises across the nation could find deceptive -- anti-deception laws differently administered in different States.                Yet, they'd survive.    There is no evidence even that there is a problem.   So why would Congress want to get rid of that particular statute?              Isn't the point, it doesn't pre-empt rules about location; it pre-empts rules about content?              That's the government's position.    Now, if that's their position, isn't it just one additional step to say depending on what the history of the statute is, that it pre-empts regulations about content that don't have to do with lying about the content?
07-581 +++$+++               I ask you -- let me ask you a naive question possibly that may -- may reflect a misunderstanding.     But my understanding is that suppose you are -- you are an employee.                You believe your employer discriminated against you, say, on gender grounds.   You have to go to the EEOC. Now, the EEOC looks into it and very often what they do is they don't really resolve it.                   They just give you a letter that gives you a right to sue. So here Congress was so worried about this kind of thing that they said our specialized agency, you know, won't be the bottom line.                People will go there and then they have a right to sue later. Now, that's how Congress felt about this particular statute.       Why would they want the union to be the bottom line when, in fact, the employee himself hasn't agreed?     I mean, the employee might agree in the first place.     He might say I'm going to take that letter, I'm not going to bring my suit.                   That's up to him or her.    But here the employee wants to bring her suit, just like the EEOC letter.              Exactly.         That's my point, is that the statute as a whole reflects a considerable effort not to let this employee get cut off at the pass and an employee who is reasonably determined to get to court probably can do it.         It's not definite.           The EEOC doesn't have to give them a letter giving them a right to sue, but probably can do it. And if that's a situation where you have this whole expert thing cut in, it seems to me there is a parallel here that Congress then wouldn't want the union and the employer together to be able to cut that right to sue off, at least not very easily.
07-582 +++$+++               Can I -- can I ask?          You can go ahead.   Are you finished?              So, what is it -- what are they supposed to do when the event is live, and lo and behold, they have a few people in front of them who swear, using these words?         What is their -- what can they do?              So, what they -- what they now -- they now do this?        In other words, whenever they cover a baseball game, whenever they cover anything live, they have to have some kind of tape system or for the Emmys, everything is on tape and it's all delayed five seconds?              I'm not talking about breaking news coverage.       I guess I'm talking about, you know, any one of -- they cover the wrestling matches, they cover -- you see what I'm driving at.                   And I would like to know what is the state of the art?                   You are saying the state of the art is right now when I turn on my television set, they all use a delay.              Or are you saying they all have to use a delay?                Did the FCC explain all this in its opinion when it said, we understand that now we're going to have to -- every incident is going to have to be -- have a 5-second delay and they will have to have tapes, and we think it's worth the cost?                Did they explain all that?                I didn't see it.              Could you review me to one thing in the record if it's there, or just tell me.              I did find an explanation for the agency deciding that "fleeting" is not going to be an automatic exemption. They've talked about that. What I didn't find is an explanation for a second thing, which had to do with their first prong of their former test, and that was the distinction that used to be made between using these words as swear words and using them as descriptive words.                   Now that, I think, showed up in their former policy because they said if they were used as a swear word we are not going to go after them, at least not immediately.                  So that had to do with prong 1, not prong 2.             So is there an explanation why they made that change?             It hasn't?             It explained -- I mean, the change I saw was that previously the use of these words as a swear was treated differently from the use of these words as a description.         And that after the event, it's not treated differently.
07-588 +++$+++              Well, the -- the -- one question I have on this is if I look at the two standards -- and the first one is "best practical" -- it talks about cost-benefit.           It says you shall consider the total cost of application of technology in relation to the effluent-reduction benefits. Then you look at "best available," and they've changed the phrase.              It doesn't get rid of cost, but it simply says you shall take into account the cost of achieving such effluent reduction.              So they both use the word "cost."              Then you look at what Senator Muskie said at the time.              And what Senator Muskie said at that time is the object here is when we move to better -- to better technology, we -- you know, when you get past the practical and you get into the other, it says -- stop considering costs?                Not quite.     He says: "While costs should be a factor in the administrator's judgment."     So he is not against using costs.                He says that you have to do it under a reasonableness standard where you are taking into account all the goals and so forth. Now, that's ambiguous.                 But, as I read it, it says:     Of course you can't avoid taking into account costs, but don't do it too much. And, therefore, you would say:                    Don't apply one of these big formal things when you reach your final goal.   There are other ways of getting there.                    Of course, see that it isn't absurd.                  And for 30 years the agency has had a way.        It has talked about "grossly disproportionate." Now, that's the whole background to the question.    My question is, of course:                   Why not let sleeping dogs lie?      Let the agency take it into account the way it's done it to prevent absurd results, but not try to do it so that it's so refined you can't even take account of what a fish is worth unless they happen to be one of the 1.2 percent that goes to market.               Okay, fine.        Then what are you arguing?    Are you arguing that you should take costs into account?    Because I don't think -- or I don't think you should reach much disagreement on that point, that sometimes you take them into account the way that Senator Muskie suggested.              Well now, what they are going to argue, I guess, is going to be up to them, and I would be very interested in hearing it.              And then you would be satisfied with the following ruling:                     The Second Circuit went too far in saying that you can never take costs into account.              Of course, you can sometimes take account of them, and the standard that we think is there -- I'm just imagining this -- is the one they have used for 30 years.             Is it grossly disproportionate?    Are you -- is it feasible?                  Is it practical?   Are you using costs along with other things? How do you feel about some slightly vague thing like that?              You are happy with that?              All right.       So it's simply saying the Second Circuit was wrong, the use of the word "cost" is meaningless without some idea --              -- of what the costs are relevant to, but a -- but a vague, grossly disproportionate test is okay with you?              Is it or not?              The one they used for 30 years at EPA, is that all right or not all right?                But the -- the -- you see the point here.     That all of his fears, your -- your opponent, brother here, seem to be manifest in this kind of a document which, if you do read Senator Muskey, seems to be the very things he was against. So -- so what is -- I am still left with your suggestion of what to do, other than just, "well, it's all fine."
07-591 +++$+++               Is there anything else?             I -- I think you're quite right that -- that, look, I can't find anything in the history that suggest lab reports would be admitted because they would be considered being prepared for trial.                    But business records are kept out. So we have here a source that's unlikely to be particularly biased, the University of Massachusetts labs.   And we have the checks of the discipline, the scientific discipline.       On the other hand, it's being prepared for this trial. So it seems to me some things go one way; some things go the other way.             I don't know exactly what the predominant things are.            That's what I'd like you to address as much as possible. And when I look at the definition of "business records hearsay exception" today, it seems to me that the "hearsay exception" does cover today some of the things under "business records" that would be prepared particularly for trial.               You could have a company that goes and measures lines on the street, or tread marks, or a variety of things.                    And I guess they come in under the "business records exception."                    Do they?   I mean, is that right?              Well, of course, it wouldn't.              And that's why -- and maybe you have nothing else you want to say on this point. It's the same as Justice Kennedy raised.              It seems like there are some things going one way, and some things going the other on the issue of whether to call it "testimonial."             There have been bad instances.    You are absolutely right.             But what -- what I'm trying to work out in my mind is not necessarily what happened in the year 1084.     I'd -- I'd be quite interested in your views on what's a workable rule.                    And when I look across the country on this, it seems most States have worked with a rule that has allowed the defendant to call the witness if he wants.              There is not a particular unfairness to that.      If he can get ahold of the witness, no problem.    But they said:           We are not going to make the State do this because it's a waste of time, for the most part.    It just delays the trial, and there is really nothing at issue.              That's true.              But if I assume -- I'm really uncertain as to whether it has covered "testimonial" or not.      And also, I'm not enamored particularly of seeing on a close question what happened in ancient history.              All right.       Now, is there anything else you want to add to me on those assumptions?              I absolutely see that point.     So that - all right, go back to the plea bargaining, which is your first thing, which makes me a little nervous for the reason that I see this bargaining system as a system where the prosecutor makes a charge, the prosecutor controls the sentence, then the defense bar would like to have an added weapon, and this added weapon is if you actually go to trial, I'm going to insist that you call these people.                   You don't even know where they are.     I'm not going to accept the lab report. And then maybe the prosecutor will lower the requirement or maybe the prosecutor raised it in the first place because he thought you would say something like that. So I'm not -- is there anything you can say about how this works in the presence of plea bargaining? Do we know any -- do we have any information on that?              No, no, there's a hearsay -- there is a hearsay aspect.                   I'm not saying it's the only thing.      There is a chain and so forth but, there is a hearsay aspect to that which you see, okay. The certificate says this is Joe Jones' birth certificate.   That's what the -- now, that's that person outside of court who made that little piece of paper for purposes of this case.       And moreover, the statement that it certifies to is directly relevant; indeed, the whole thing falls without it. So, are you going to say the same thing applies, your rule, and you have to call the recordkeeper in or not?        And I think you're going to say not.   And if you're going to say not, I want to know what the distinction is?             You are going to calling in -- you're going to --
07-6053 +++$+++              How much are we supposed to follow the common law, in your opinion, as it was in the 18th century or 12th century, or something?                    I mean suppose, to take a fanciful example -- I mean -- but suppose there was a common-law rule.                    And I know there wasn't, but suppose there was a common-law rule that said in cases involving witches you cannot admit any evidence because either the witch, the accused witch, came up out of the water when they were dunking her, and, therefore, she is guilty, so there is no need; or she is under water, which shows she is, you know, guilty, but you can't cross-examine a person under water. Now if there were a rule like that, would we now incorporate it into the Constitution of the United States?   The answer is meant to be no. (Laughter.)             Now, let's get more realistic.   There are all kinds of rules --             Okay.       So there are all kinds of rules of disqualification of witnesses in the 17th and 18th century.        You couldn't testify.            In this case there would have been no admission if she had been married to the man instead of being his girlfriend.                    You couldn't have a spouse; you couldn't have an interested party; you couldn't have a child who didn't understand the oath; you couldn't have a person who was an atheist; you couldn't have somebody who was a convicted felon. So now are we supposed to incorporate all of these things into the Confrontation Clause?             It doesn't have to do with the Confrontation Clause that you couldn't cross-examine person who didn't understand the meaning of the oath?             So what about a person who -- the same facts that he could not -- wasn't eligible to testify?   At common law you never could have gotten that person to testify in court, no matter what.                 And, therefore, what?    That's what I'm asking, if we are supposed to follow all of the contours of that rule.               All right.       But, now, does that make sense?    For example, if this woman had been married, she could not.         She -- her testimony -- whether your client deliberately procured her absence, accidentally procured her absence, whatever he did, that testimony could not have come in, is that right, if she was married to him?               I'm trying to drive at what the contours are.    Which ones do we ignore, and which don't --               I don't think I did --              I joined Crawford, and Justice Scalia would like to kick me off the boat, which I'm rapidly leaving in any event, but the -- (Laughter.)              Right.           But my question -- I want to go back because what I'm finding difficult is -- well, let's take the specific case.                     Suppose they had been married.    If they had been married in 1789, I guess, or 1750, or 1400, or whenever, her testimony would not have come in regardless.                  I think I'm right on that.              Yes, as a spouse.          And, therefore, whether he procured her absence or not is beside the point.    Now, do we follow that rule under the Confrontation Clause today?
07-608 +++$+++                 For that, you'd have to assume that the GS-12 who drafted this, or whoever the equivalent was in the Senate, put the "that" in the wrong place.    If he had put the "that" after the (i) when he broke it down, it would all read as a sentence. The "that" would be for the first part, and you'd say "felony committed" for the part that interests us.                 Does that work?
07-610 +++$+++               What I don't understand about --              Finish because there's something --             That's the part I don't understand.    It's not your fault.               I don't understand it in the cases either.       What First Amendment right are we talking about?    There is an individual who, under the agency shop, pays dues to a union.                  Now, suppose the union uses some of that money in a way that has nothing to do with politics, nothing to do with speech, but it doesn't happen to benefit that particular member. For example, you can have a central union headquarters 4,000 miles away where there's a librarian who's doing research on a matter that will help lots of people, but nobody in this area.                Or you could have a program to commemorate the people who were hurt in the State of Hawaii at a union uprising or strike of some kind where nobody in this particular area is ever going to go. Now, both of those activities are totally legitimate union activities that have nothing to do with politics.    But this particular place won't benefit from them.    Okay, what in the First Amendment prohibits the union from paying for such an activity out of general union dues assessed on everybody?                 And why would the First Amendment prohibit such a thing?               Fine.       If they are chargeable because they have nothing to do with politics, perfectly legitimate, why isn't it also chargeable to pay for the costs of a lawsuit which has nothing to do with politics, totally for a union purpose, it just doesn't happen to benefit that person who's miles away in a different local?               I don't want you to tell me about cases.     I'm abstracting from -- I want to know the reasoning.     I want to know why.               I said there is no politics in any of these expenditures.               42 bishops would swear there is nothing here that has anything to do with politics.             But that's the reasoning that you seem to accept and I guess all human activity is banned.   Because to my knowledge, all human activity takes place through speech with a few exceptions that are not here relevant.              And the case -- the case that says that a union member, person forced into the union agency shop -- and I guess a lawyer who has to pay to be an integrated bar and I guess a doctor who has to join a medical association -- the case that says that these people have a First Amendment right to get back money that's being wasted, is what?             So unless it's political in your view, you don't have that right?
07-615 +++$+++               Is it the case that there are two other individuals who have attached this judgment?              All right.        And is it the case that Iran's position in respect to those attachments is that those attachments, insofar as they are valid and executed, require a setoff from whatever we owe Iran or vice-versa?             No.     I'm saying I take it from something I have read in this that Iran believes that if, in fact, it won a judgment and that judgment is from someone like Cubic --             -- who they thought was prevented from delivering planes because of the embargo -- so it was relevant -- that that judgment, which they get if they collect on it, should be deducted from other money the United States owes them.             -- unless instead of them getting it, the attacher gets it.             The attachee gets it.             Has to get the money for the attaching person.      That's my point.               And so that is at issue before the -- and -- and it is at issue in those cases. If the person who attaches it gets the money rather than Iran, Iran will say:      We do not have to have a setoff.               Isn't that right or --               And that is the same question that you think would be presented through this attachment, is that right?               Dr. Elahi is one of several persons, is that right?               What I'm trying to get at is Iran's position vis-a-vis the Elahi judgment is the same as its position vis-a-vis the other two attachments on the Elahi judgment.               That if Iran ends up with the money, you can subtract it from other money the United States owes them.        But if the attaching people end up with the money, you cannot.              You would take the same position if, in fact, this money which is owed to Iran by -- by Cubic -- that is, Cubic, which then Iran got a judgment on -- instead of a judgment in favor of Iran, Cubic had written them a check, and they had taken the check and bought a house in Manhattan, or they had put it in an Iranian bank account, and either Mr. Elahi or one of the other two people sought to attach the bank account or the house or the grocery store, which they might have also have used.         Am I right --              -- or wrong?              I don't see why either is the slightest a bit more attenuated.                      In either case they are owned by the Ministry of Defense of Iran.
07-636 +++$+++               At the end of your argument, could you just spend a minute because my state of mind is I'm sorry we limited it.                     You've sort of briefed this question pretty fully.              And I'm tempted to try to decide it.   I know you want to make your four points. Go right ahead.   But at the end, could you possibly say, why shouldn't we just go ahead and decide the substance, not as a technical matter.          Are we really going to get something out of remanding it that we don't already know?   But don't do that now, but whenever you want.
07-665 +++$+++                That seems to be the problem here.    And what I have in this is the -- the problem I have is that we seem to be applying these subcategories in a very absolute way.                    Why can't we call this what it is -- it's a mixture of private speech with Government decisionmaking -- and ask the question, as we do in election cases, is the restriction proportionate to a legitimate objective?           I know how you're going to answer that question.       You're going to say:               Of course, it is. But what's interesting me is, are we bound in these cases to apply what I think of as an artificial kind of conceptual framework or are we free to ask what seems to me to be at the heart of the matter?                   The answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetically is:                   Of course the Government can't do that because it's disproportionate.              So what is the answer to the -- what is the answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetical?   What is the answer to the homosexual hypothetical?   What is the answer?              Because that tests the theory.              But suppose they only accept Democrats who are sculptors, and they reject all the Republicans?              Now, what in the First Amendment -- are you saying the First Amendment would not stop that?
07-689 +++$+++                 The rule I suggested, though there are arbitrary aspects is a better targeted, more administrable -- or equally administrable or not much worse administrable arbitrary rule.                There must be somebody there to get you over 50 percent.                 Thirty-three plus 11 is 44. So where does the rest come from?                 That's 40, and then -- oh, I see, 39 plus 11.                 If they vote cohesively.
07-6984 +++$+++               What happens -- just out of curiosity, a prisoner's lawyer doesn't take the appeal, the time expires, bong, the year begins to run.                 Within that year he files federal habeas.                Then he discovers that he had a right to a state appeal.                 So he goes, just like this man, goes back and, sure enough, he gets his direct appeal, and three years later or a year later they finish the direct appeal.             Bong, he can file again. Is that his first habeas or his second habeas?              Yes.               No.               Yes.               I doubt that one -- I mean, one may never arise but --               The first one is proper and on your view so is the second one proper.                So they are both proper, and there are two of them.                 And --             No, nobody knows about this.             No, but nobody knows that the State made a mistake in not giving him a direct review.             Oh, forget my hypothetical. They're never going to come up.

I mean there -- we don't know quite a lot about whether they would have gotten a warrant, how -- how dangerous it was, whether the drugs were likely to be hidden.              And I was thinking of it, and that's why I am saying this, is that it's a perfect reason since constitutional questions in this area are -- are like the stars in the sky.   There are so many.         Rather than having the judges answer each one and getting everything mixed up, why not just have them take whatever is the easier path?             As a judge I like to take what is the easier path.             And if it's easier to deal with the qualified immunity, deal with it and forget the rest of it.              I see that, but unless we do that here, they are never going to get the right message.   And so what we will have is 1,000 judges trying in an average in a year 50 or 60 cases each with multiple facts, and we will have approximately over a 10-year period hundreds of thousands.                   I've exaggerated, but there will be many, many -- many, many conflicts, many, many confusions.       And unless we say, no, we are not doing it ourselves, how will they ever get the message?              We don't always have to do it, but I mean once.               -- to the question.        I mean, look, if I have to answer the constitutional question -- and what bothers me is this consent at one remove.    What?   You are saying a drug seller who lets in a disguised policeman in order to sell him a drug because he thinks he's a druggie is suddenly consenting to the entire LAPD coming into his house?                    I would think that is the last thing he would have thought about wanting, not the first.               Well, maybe they both should be the same.       I --
07-77 +++$+++               What happened -- I have a factual question.     In around July, Mr. Sam Jones is sworn in and now he is in office until sometime after, I guess, September 1988, a little over a year, and then the Governor appointed him.             Well, he must have gotten paid during that year.              And then when the Governor appointed him, what does the appointment look like? Does it say it's retroactive?             No.      I would be surprised.   I mean, you're not going to tell me it is. So my guess is he's appointed as of -- let's say he's appointed by the Governor.          It must have said as of when, and it probably said as of September '88.              Well, I think it's important to me because, for this reason:                 I would guess they don't make it retroactive or you'd know it, and therefore we -- we have more.             We have the facts, the following facts, as to whether -- and this is what Fordice says; it says this is a practical question. It's not some theory about whether it's unconstitutional or not unconstitutional.         The question is as practical matter was it in force and effect?                 And, as a practical matter, one, there was an election under it; two, somebody was elected; three, he took office; four, he held that office for a year and was paid for it.                All right?   Why, as a practical fact, as a practical matter, we do not say that special election law was in force and effect for about a year and two months?              Yes, their registering is a precondition of voting.         Not one person had ever voted. Moreover, they all had to register again.                  So the net practical effect of the election, of plan two in Young v. Fordice, was null, zero, zilch.                  And the practical effect here is that somebody is elected under the law, holds office for a year and two months, and is paid.                    It seems to me quite a big difference.              All right.      I mean, that's what I wanted to know.        I mean, maybe it's different if this was a retroactive something or other, but I -- you're not aware of that.              So I assume it wasn't. -- tell you as I'm standing  -- that the appointment was               All right.         Suppose I reject that on the ground of what I said.                     I'm not saying I would, but suppose I did.                  Isn't that the end of this case?    Because then, if I reject that, there is a plan.   The plan is called "the special election plan." It is in effect for a year and two months.                     People hold office in election and they're paid.                     And then a new plan comes along, the governor's plan.                     Now that seems to me a change, and the statute says that if you have a change, which this would be, you've got to preclear it. End of matter. Now, what's your argument about that?              No, I'm just using that as shorthand, the shorthand for a system under which the officeholder is appointed by the government -- by the governor.              And I'm saying if we start from the base that the plan is special election which was in force and effect for a year and two months, then for whatever set of reasons there is a change, and the State has to preclear the change.               Now, what's the answer to that?              All right.      So you're saying that if the cause of a change is a court decision, then you do not have to preclear.               So that if in Mississippi in 1975, there had been a ruling of a court which said segregationist plan number one here is no good, so we're going to go back to the even worse plan that was before, that that wouldn't have had to have been precleared?              You see where I'm going, and I'm not phrasing it correctly, but you can answer it anyway.              But what my question is, is there any authority for the proposition that between 1964 and today, it mattered whether the cause of a change in a State plan was a decision of let's say five members of a court -- of a State court -- or whether it was a legislative decision.               Because that's what I think you're arguing, and is there any authority that supports you on that?
07-772 +++$+++                Can you help me with this? Suppose I'm a trial judge and I instruct the jury in a technical matter, an important but technical matter, and when they have questions about it I say read the instruction.    Suppose I'm right as far as the instruction goes.     But say the prosecutor gets everybody mixed up.    Now, I guess if the prosecutor gets people mixed up enough, that could becomes a due process violation.     But I suspect that it has to be quite a lot of mix-up, that intuitively is what I suspect.              Are there any cases I should look at, one that would tell me how mixed up the prosecutor has to get everybody before it's a due process violation?               In Brown, in that case did they find that he did get them too mixed up or he didn't?             He did not.       So unless in this case the prosecutor got everybody more mixed up than in the Brown case, we should just reverse.                But what he's saying, I think now, is if there was no gun in the car -- suppose the jury thinks there's no gun in the car, then he didn't even know there was going to be a shooting, but that the prosecutor in the context of the trial had given the jury the impression that they could convict this person even if the person did not know there was going to be a drive-by shooting. And he's saying that the finding to the contrary, the statement to the contrary in the Supreme Court of Washington is wrong.               When I look at that, I will find, he says, that the prosecutor gave the impression, as I just said, that even without a gun your involvement with this gang is enough to convict him of murder.   What is your response to that?                  You know the record.   I don't.
07-773 +++$+++              There is a dispute between people.   You look at their underlying dispute, the underlying one, and you say:            Is there diversity? What's the problem?             Why -- why wouldn't you do just what I said, just what we started with?                       You take out the arbitration agreement, and then you look to see what this dispute is about.             And if it's about something that happens to involve all people from one side in one State and from another State on the other side, there is jurisdiction.    Why is that a problem?                  I don't understand.             Why?             Why?              That's your view, but I mean believe me, I think I can keep that problem under control.     That was your original point.                I see the point, it's going to spread too far; you'd have to have some rules that cabin it. Assume I got that under control; maybe I don't.     This is a case of "well, his brother was worse." What do you want to say about the criticisms of the horrible things that happen if we adopt your position?
07-8521 +++$+++ 
07-854 +++$+++              I suppose the distinction he's trying to make maybe -- I'm not sure I've got it right, but you see there are certain kinds of systems that maybe administratively an office ought to have. And where it turns out that this is really an administrative system, a lot of offices do have it, some don't, but where it was negligent not to have it and the very presence of it would have prevented the -- the individual in the courtroom from behaving the way he did, well, that's a separate kind of a claim.                    That's an administrative claim. Just as if, for example, suppose you had no secretary or assistants.        He says, look, everybody should have secretarial assistance.                    And if only you had secretarial assistance, these people would not have misread everything the way they did or would have gotten the phone calls or would have done something like that. That's the kind of line -- so he's trying to draw a line there between something that is pretty purely administrative and -- and something that is really supervisory and training.         And he is not saying supervisory and training.         He is saying that was a separate claim.              Training in today's world or he wants to say in that day's world, whatever it was. They have information systems.               They existed, and every office ought to have them.           And now he says I might lose on that claim; but, nonetheless, it's not the kind of claim that falls within Imbler.               I think that's his point.    I'm not positive.         He doesn't have to take my --
07-869 +++$+++                  But if in fact there is a charity, which charity in Idaho is a charity that makes all of its contributions to help support right-to-work laws.     All right.    So that charity goes and says, could you -- we'd like a payroll deduction.                        Can they get it, or not?                 You don't know.          Okay.   So, then, we do know this.           We do know -- what I'm wondering is:   Isn't this case, to me, quite confused about something fairly simple?           The question would be:               Look, one, do you or do you not in Idaho allow anybody to have payroll deductions for anything?                 And I take it your answer to that question is:              Yes, we do allow some payroll deductions for some things.                       Okay? So then we look at this one, and it says: No payroll deductions for union activities that are political.   All right?        Now, you either do have or you do not have a justification for that difference.                        If you have a reasonable, or whatever the sufficient test is, justification for the difference, you win.                        And if you don't, you lose.     And, indeed, whether you are the State or the county could have to do with the plausibility of the justification. Here we are, end of case, traditional.                       You just -- you didn't argue it that way, I guess, below. What's wrong with that?               There certainly, I would think, would be a problem if the right-to-work people can get there.     And you are not going to let the unions get there.   But I don't know the facts.                  So shouldn't we just send this case back and say:                  Please look at what the situation is?     If they have to treat some people one way, some people another, bad; if they don't, everybody is treated alike for good reason, probably okay.
07-901 +++$+++              Am I right in -- I just want to get the facts right.            Am I right, you did this historical research, and if you start with Apprendi we can go all the way back to Nebuchadnezzar and you haven't found a single case ever where it was a jury rather than a judge that made this question of how you put together sentences for two separate crimes committed on the same occasion?      Is that right, or is it an overstatement?             I didn't say how far you went back.   I said as far as you went back.             I don't know what Nebuchadnezzar found, but I take it you did look to see what was true at the time of the writing of the Constitution.               And at the time of the writing of the Constitution, which sometimes some of us feel is relevant, in that instance they did have the judge, not the jury, decide how to create a total sentence where the person had committed two crimes on the same occasion.             What about the -- what about restitution, forfeiture, taking a child and having him tried as an adult?       What about probation?          What about alternative drug programs?               What about diversion? I mean, I can think of five or six where there might be a factual finding necessary to proceed to a situation where the total amount of punishment is greater rather than less.             And doesn't the sentencing -- doesn't the Federal law define a sentence to include restitution, to include what is the equivalent of probation?   I mean, there is a broad definition of the word "sentence" in the law which includes some of the things that I mentioned, though not all.
07-9712 +++$+++ 
07-984 +++$+++              I -- I perhaps am missing this.   I -- this is in general what I don't understand, how this works.    My understanding is that under 404 something is "fill" -- they have a definition.             And it's "fill," among other things, if it changes the bottom level of any portion of water in the United States.                Is that right?             And somewhere I have the idea -- but I can't find it in the briefs now -- that it has to raise the bottom level by 55 feet.             There is some number of feet.              That's the result of this case.   But, anyway, it raises the level.                   I guess it has to raise it some significant amount.                    All right.   So what happens in this situation? Let us think of the worst pollutant you can think of.   Think of that.         I don't know what it is. Maybe it's saturated fat in potato chips, something absolutely terrible.              All right.         We are going to think of that pollutant.         And now let's suppose that with the agreement of the Army Corps of Engineers a company takes this pollutant, which is the worst one you could think of, that the EPA would never let you go within 50 feet of it, and they take it, and they fill a lake with it up to the level of 55 feet, or 20 feet, or whatever number of feet. I mean, it just can't be that simply because they poured a lot of it in and it fills up the bottom of the lake that suddenly the EPA can't regulate it any more.   Now, that -- that -- since that's so counterintuitive, that all you have to do is take a terrible pollutant and fill the bottom of the lake with it and now it's up to the Army Corps of Engineers and not up to the EPA -- that's so counterintuitive that I assume I don't understand the statute, and you will explain it to me.                Uh-huh.             It is identical.   So it doesn't make any difference.             I -- I heard you say before that it was not identical.          That -- I mean if, of course, EPA takes all its regs and applies those regs when the Army Corps of Engineers considers a permit under 404 so that you couldn't get an Army Corps of Engineers permit unless you complied with the 402 etcetera regs, then this all could come to nothing.             So there must be something missing in that.             What?             What is the most important thing that is missing?             I think what might be missing --
07-9995 +++$+++                There could be a thousand reasons why under State law a particular jury is improperly constituted.       So you are saying whenever the State under whatever State laws it has says that the judge made a mistake about who to put on the jury, that that violates the Federal Constitution.                 Well, why?      One qualification is that a jury -- a juror can't be prejudiced.    All right.          I think it's a very common thing for prosecutors and defense lawyers to get into arguments about whether a particular juror is or is not prejudiced.    Okay. So sometimes the judge excuses them, maybe five million times a year; and probably in a certain percentage, maybe 5,000 or 500 or 50,000, the judge is wrong.   All right. So the State appellate court says he's wrong.     So the jury wasn't made up properly. Now you are saying in every one of those cases that violates the Federal Constitution.                 I have never heard of this before.               It may be there is some precedent for it.     I don't know.              That's why I am asking.               So that means that held -- we have held in that case -- I had better look at it -- that in any instance where excusing a juror violates State law that that is a violation of the Federal Constitution.     Which is the case that says that?
08-1008 +++$+++ 
08-103 +++$+++ 
08-1065 +++$+++              Why do we need that theory? I mean, why not just say what Newman said and the others said?     There is no free-standing right.                 There is just a right not to convict a person with made-up evidence, and of course a prosecutor insofar as he's involved in the prosecutorial stage is absolutely immune.                    But if he's involved in the investigatorial stage of that event, well, then he's not immune absolutely.                    That's a policy decision.     That has nothing to do with free-standing rights.             All right.         Then I'm making that argument.             Mere foreseeability.           You can fill in those boundaries, Toffler, not Toffler, as you wish.   But the basic theory isn't a problem because, after all, we're just drawing a line somewhere within the stage of an ongoing tort on the basis of policy, and Buckley suggests such a line.            I don't see a conceptual problem there, is my problem.            Maybe there are practical problems, but I don't see a conceptual one.             I interrupt you right there.   I would say they are not absolutely immune for the whole constitutional offense.                That's the line I'm trying to draw.               So I agree with you on that.   I agree with you.         I won't do it.             I'll take it as one tort.     Began before the investigation stage, ends with conviction.     One tort.          Now, within that tort we draw a line and we draw a line based on policy purposes as to when the prosecutor is absolutely or qualifiedly immune, and where that line comes is Buckley, approximately.     Okay? Now, I don't see a conceptual problem with that and I'm having a hard time finding a practical problem.
08-108 +++$+++                So what if it isn't?         I mean, suppose you had a statute, and the statute says it is a crime to mug a man from Denver.                      That's a Denver ordinance, by the way, because no one else would pass it.   I mean, but if those were the elements of the crime, I guess, we do normally apply knowingly to each of them.               Whether -- even if it isn't ordinary usage.               I was thoughtfully trying to push you on to the next argument.
08-1107 +++$+++  
08-1119 +++$+++              Now, but when you say it isn't referred to, it seems to me to be referred to.                It says "The term 'debt relief agency' means 'any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person."    And the term "bankruptcy assistance" is defined to include "appearing in a case or proceeding on behalf of another or providing legal representation with respect to a case or proceeding." Doesn't a lawyer provide legal representation?             All right.       So doesn't the term "provide legal representation" include a lawyer?              Yes; they include other people besides lawyers.              I don't know.        What is it getting at with "providing legal representation with respect to a case"?              It would seem to be a lawyer.              Yeah.        Those are other people who are covered.             What the attorney says is, Here's what we will do; when we file for bankruptcy, I will ask the Court to approve my own fees as something that is continuing after bankruptcy.            And he says, This is what they will be. So what is the harm --            -- since that's what he has to do, of making him tell his client that that's what he has to do?            No, you -- you can't?       This prevents you had from saying, What I'm going to do is ask the bankruptcy judge to approve what I just said?            Of course.       And so what's wrong with the law that tells the lawyer that's what he has to tell the client?
08-1134 +++$+++           What's the strongest case, I mean, that you can muster in favor of this proposition, my question being the same as Justice Sotomayor's?     What s the strongest case where you can find any court that said a matter is void -- it s void, not -- not just legal error, so you can attack it 90 years later -- it's void just because the lower court that made the error didn't apply a clear statute?          Give me your strongest case.          But I d like an answer to my question, because I can -- I have read the treatises, which I have in front of me, and they say that it's void only if you show a -- the same thing that Justice Sotomayor just said.           And so, since I don't think there is some kind of constitutional due process error here, and there s clearly jurisdiction over the parties, I guess you are saying there wasn't subject matter jurisdiction, which is a little vague. And so I want to know what's the clearest case, strongest for you, where a court has ever said that a failure of some -- of some other court to apply the language of a statute properly, no matter how clear, is a lack of subject matter jurisdiction?           What is your strongest precedent?   That's all I'm asking.          All right.          Well -- we're conceding that they violated the statute, the bankruptcy judge. The question is whether it's void.               And void, as you just said, was three categories:           One, was there a violation of basic due process for your client?                I don't see it.   Two, did the bankruptcy judge have jurisdiction over the parties?   It seems the answer is yes.                And, three, did they have subject matter jurisdiction?                 Which we started by saying was vague. So I asked you for your strongest case.           You said Vallely.   I have only looked at it quickly, but it's only four pages.    And what that case seems to say is that there is a statute which says there is bankruptcy jurisdiction over all commercial businesses except for insurance companies and two other categories. This party here is an insurance company, and and therefore they can attack it later, because there was no jurisdiction over an insurance company. Now, if that's your strongest case, I don't know what the others are going to say, but it seems to me you don't have much precedental support to put this in a category of lacking jurisdiction.           Well, what about the consequence of -- there happen to be -- well, I counted -- 14 different kinds of things that follow that comma, including criminal fines, sentences.              There are all kinds of things.   And is it the consequence of my accepting your argument that anybody who is a creditor in respect to any of those 14 things can come in at any time and announce under Rule 60(b)(4), even if it's 10 years later, that the district court -- the bankruptcy court made a mistake?           Now, that would be quite -- to me -- extraordinary.     So I hope the answer from your point of view must still be no.          Wait a moment.    What would it be in the case where you have a discharge order and it says things in it which somebody feels fall within 1 of these 13 categories?     Now, are you saying that that somebody can come back and make his argument 15 years later, because he will say that, since it falls in that category, the judgment is void insofar as this language covers what I don't want it to cover?           Well, but you see, it's the same problem that s bothering us.              I would like a yes or no answer.           Is it the case if somebody feels the conditions were not met with in the 13 categories that -- or 14 -- that follow the comma, he -- you feel that they were met.              The other side says, they weren't met.     I sent him a notice, but it was in a balloon, okay.     You know, was the notice a real notice, wasn't it?     People argue about that. So in any case where you have a person who says, no, they weren't met, and the other side says, yes, they were met, that first person can come back 13 years later and say that the judgment was void?               Is the answer of the government yes or no?            All right.   Is there any --          Oh, they may not have said it right, but they -- but they -- that s a different problem.   But the -- the -- why doesn't the Treasury just say to people:     We re not going to insure your loans where you don't object.          All right.     Then the government is harmless.
08-1175 +++$+++              What about the right in Miranda that says -- in Miranda -- "We hold an individual held for interrogation must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with the lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation."     Okay? Where does it say that?                Interpret it any way you want.     You know, we are used to grand juries. In a grand jury, he can go consult with a lawyer, but he doesn't have the lawyer with him.             So, where does it tell him that?             Yes.             I'm just asking you to point to the words that tell him that.             Don't have you a right to talk to a lawyer at a grand jury?             Yes, correct.     And so aren't you supposed to tell this person, that unlike a grand jury, you have a right to have the lawyer with you during interrogation?       I mean, it isn't as if that was said in passing in Miranda.           They wrote eight paragraphs about it.   And I just wonder, where does it say in this warning you have the right to have the lawyer with you during the interrogation?             It doesn't use the word "present," Miranda?     It says right here:           "We hold" -- it says -- "not just prior to questioning, but also to have counsel present during any questioning."              That's what Miranda says.     And then Miranda, after discussing it for five pages, goes on to use the words I just said. You have to tell him he has the right to have counsel with him.   So it does use the word "present."           Well, what FBI are we talking about?    Because the FBI advice of rights says: "You have the right to have a lawyer with you during questioning."    Were they -- and -- and I was taken by the fact, "We hold that an individual must be clearly informed." And so, is there some other case that says -- or some other FBI statement that they give people that doesn't use the words "with you," that says you don't have to say "with you during," or doesn't have to say "present during"?       Was there some other case that said that?            Excuse me.   Can you just devote one minute before you finish  -            -- to the question of why these are adequate?     If you remember my question, I tried to explain why I thought they might not be adequate.            But there were four. One is to have during, in the presence of, the right to have a lawyer during the interrogation, in the presence of, with him at the time.            Now, that's one of the four.   That's one of the things they devote two pages to Miranda, and they repeat it when they summarize what you have to say.       I just want to know where in this statement does it say that?          Really?      I guess anybody who has had prior experience with the law, as this man might have done, might be familiar with a grand jury proceeding.          No, no, no.      But I tell you:   Here's your right to talk to a lawyer before questioning.          Now, you then repeat, you can assert that right whenever you want, to talk to him before questioning.          And my question is, how does that tell him he has a right to have a lawyer with him during questioning, that the questioning he has a right to have take place from beginning to end in the presence of a lawyer, a matter that the Miranda Court repeated three times in the summary and wrote eight full paragraphs about why that was important?            Where does it say it approves that?            It wasn't though, actually.            It isn't -- it isn't consistent with it.     That's interesting.            They didn't say anything about during.            So anyway -- then they don't need to mention  during  at all because if that's right, the FBI warning at that time, J. Edgar Hoover's letter or whatever it was, just talked about telling you, you have a right to counsel.             It doesn't say anything about  during.          So then you think that, in fact, going by that warning, that there is no constitutional right to have them say a word about during.     This would be okay if they said nothing at all about it.
08-1191 +++$+++                Now, that's -- I would like you to follow that up specifically.                       That is, in my mind the difficult issue in this case is not the jurisdictional issue under principles of international law.   It's the question of the scope of the statute. And there the things against you are three.                       One is Professor Sachs's argument, which I would like to know your answer to.    The second is in Judge Friendly's two opinions. The first opinion -- the second one, rather, Bersch, he says if you had a foreign exchange and foreign plaintiffs as -- and there was no foreign plaintiff, the security issued over a foreign exchange, even if that fraud takes place totally in the United States, the statute wouldn't cover it.                        That's Friendly, which started this. And the third thing is what he says in Leasco.    He says:     We cannot see any sound reason for not taking your position, at least for the plaintiffs who are Americans.        Okay? Now, France, Britain and Australia have filed briefs in this case giving what they consider very sound reasons, which are reasons that Judge Friendly never considered.       And those three reasons, as we know, is they point to a number of conflicts, that if you win, how that will interfere with their efforts to regulate their own securities markets, right? That's all one question:                      Professor Sachs, Friendly in Bersch, and Friendly in Leasco.                        But that's what I'd like to hear your answer to.             What do you -- do you want to finish?             Then -- I mean, I can see. I will give you all that.            That isn't what is bothering me.     I think you are right so far as what you have argued.     But the part that I think is most difficult is why I -- I shorthand referred to Professor Sachs' article.             Because what Australia is actually saying is what we don't like about -- about the American system, you know, their -- their common criticisms of class actions.              We say, first of all, the American rule means even if our companies here are right, that they are going to have to pay their legal fees.     We don't like punitive damages.                 We don't like that we have the opt-out.            And these are all our citizens, and we don't want to subject our companies on our exchange to that stuff. Now, fine, they have a reason on their side. Then Professor Sachs says:             Read the statute, because they argue -- it was never intended to cover that kind of stuff.     Now, that's what I would like you to address specifically.
08-1198 +++$+++              But there is no such answer.             I thought, in contracts, there is no such answer.        When you interpret a contract and it doesn't say, you try to figure out -- I used to be taught that; probably I am way out-of-date -- you try to figure out what a reasonable party would have intended.             And I thought that's what Bazzle said, that --             Not as out-of-date. (Laughter.)          Yes.          I see that now, but then -- but there are two separate questions.          My question was, first, the same as Justice Ginsburg.          And I have a question for you on that, because in reading these briefs, I thought your description of who is to decide this matter of whether there is to be a class action was just what you said:   The question of who should decide it is a matter for the parties.          So when I looked at -- I just have been reading Bazzle three, five times, and there seemed --          All right.     But what it seems to say is that that's a matter to figure out from a contract and background circumstances.              In Bazzle, the contract was:     Any -- all disputes relating to this contract. Here, it doesn't say that.           It says:   "Any dispute arising from the performance, termination, or making of the contract." Now, a class-action determination does relate to.     Maybe it doesn't arise out of, okay?            That's an argument.          So why are all these briefs saying that what Bazzle said was:              Whenever this is silent, it goes to the arbitrator; the who question is answered at arbitration. I can't find it saying that.           Yes, I know.     I know.   But what I actually thought doesn't matter.              What matters is what is said.          Now, you're -- so the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question is, as to the who question, who shall decide whether or not in your case class actions are permissible?          The who question in Bazzle, because of the contract and background, was the arbitrator.          The who question here, irrespective of the contract is the arbitrator for the reason that Justice Ginsburg said.                There's a separate saying:   You are the who; you, arbitrators, are the who.          So now we look to the what. They then decided it.          What -- what did they decide? And you are saying that's wrong.            And there you run into all the authority, Misco, who used to be in other places, saying when the arbitrator says something, unless it's in Marrs, follow it.                 That's what you are addressing.          That -- isn't that -- you and I have a contract.     I'll ship you 17 pounds of durum wheat, and you will pay me $43.           In the meantime, a green worm eats up all the durum wheat, and therefore they can't send durum wheat; they send some duhu wheat. All right?      Question:        Is the contract valid or not?             Answer that purpose.   We have arbitrators for that purpose.             Arbitrators will look to see what it says.     If it says nothing, they will try to determine what the parties thought.                If they can't determine what they thought, they will look to custom, analogy, et cetera.     Now --             They won't?
08-1200 +++$+++              So what -- the part that's worrying me most is where the lawyer is the debt collector.     All right?      So he's within the act, and he has a client of debt collectors, and the clients all say:   Please go collect the debt.                 And they say:        We want to do this, like in this -- suppose in this case, they say:    Tell us if you don't owe it; ask them to write a letter to that effect; we won't collect it; now, is that legal? And the lawyer looks up everything in sight and says, yes, it's legal.            And then that's what he thinks.     All the circuits have said this.                   And then he asks the FTC and they say, yes, it's legal.                      So there he is.    Everybody's told him it's legal.                    And lo and behold, this Court, surprisingly, holds the opposite. Well, he shouldn't be liable.              And if he has to worry about that, he can never defend his client.                      The only answer is:     Whatever the man says who is opposed to your client, that's what you have to do.                      That can't be the meaning of this statute.             No, no.          What the FTC said is:   We won't give you one.             So he is a lawyer litigating for a client.        That was my hypothetical.             Yes.             It's not a mistake.         The point is, in a sense, that any decent lawyer would say that's what the law was; that sometimes lawyers get surprised because courts don't always act the way they think is reasonable.             Why aren't they in good faith?             Both.             Ah, but that's in your view of it.     I am saying that the opposite view of it is that your view of it puts lawyers in an impossible position, let alone the client.             It -- it's not just that it's unfair.     It's worse than unfair.                 The lawyer is under an obligation to represent his client, and he cannot do anything but tell the client:                 Just pay money to this particular plaintiff whose view of the law is totally contrary to every circuit court that's ever decided it.    Now, how can you put lawyers in that position?            But it -- but it suggests that you would like a -- a sensible interpretation of this that avoids the result I said, if possible.             And there is a different way of going about it, which is you could say that a bona fide error in respect to a lawyer imposes much higher standards on that lawyer than it does on most -- and it's simply a client -- that before you can call an error bona fide, that lawyer really has to look into it.     He has to have asked the FTC.          He has to have gotten -- and made an effort to get a letter back.     And if there are one or two circuits that hold the other way, well, where?             And if you don't, you are not bona fide. Now, that would get to virtually the same place but it would protect the lawyer against true legal surprise.             So how -- how do we do that?   Because you see, you are quite right.             The client runs the same risk in antitrust law in a whole other lot of areas.     Absolutely right.           But once you bring the lawyer into it, the lawyer has what he doesn't have in an antitrust case under your reading, which is an incentive to distort the law in order to protect his own pocketbook.     And that is, to me, a big problem. So you say there is -- there is a -- a way around that.     And what?                The lawyer writes a letter to the client.    The first thing the lawyer tries to do is to settle the case.         "Dear Client:             Please send me the money, and by the way, if you don't owe it, tell me in writing." Okay?      That's what the lawyer does.                 That's a legal activity.     It's at the heart of practicing law, because nobody goes to court anymore.                    And -- though he will, if necessary, so he's part of this. Now, how do we get out of this problem that I'm putting?     I'm really looking for an answer to that, because I think it's a big problem.             Well, maybe your colleague can, but how -- so they define a -- the reasonable error falls in is because he's a person who regularly collects or attempts to collect consumer debts owed to a -- you know, owed to another person.           That's pretty broad. That doesn't come about until '86.               You are saying the bona fide language there is before, in '77?               Okay.       But then what -- how -- but I still can't figure out how we get this thing to work here, and -- and you just came up with a new idea.               So -- I get -- okay.
08-1214 +++$+++          So suddenly it's all a lot of things that would have been pre-empted to go to the board.   For example, you have a labor dispute on a construction business, and one union's out there telling the other:     Keep on going.              And then some other group comes in and says:            Don't let them do that to you.     And another says:         You don't have to do that under your contract.     And there are 19 unions and they are all fighting about -- each other, and everybody is going to end up suing each other in Federal court. I thought the purpose of the LMRA was to stop that.     The purpose of the Labor Act, the Wagner Act was to stop that.      They didn't want Federal courts any more than State courts interfering in that kind of thing.     So why should we read an exception into this?        It would reproduce the situation that led all the Congresses and Presidents in the 1930s to stop it.        Yes, that's right, and they said:    Here's how we ll deal with that.          We ll deal with that by giving the employer and the union a right to go into court and enforce the contract or get damages for its violation.            That we figure furthers labor relations. But it's pretty hard for me to see how it could further labor relations by letting any third party under the sun come in and say everything that went on during a labor dispute is a -- is a tort in respect to the contract that might not even have been signed yet.         Yes, but what -- there is no doubt about the formation, just as Justice Sotomayor said.    There is a contract, the contract that was signed on December 17th.             It is formed.     You don't doubt that it's formed.            They don't doubt that it's formed.   And that contract has an arbitration agreement in it.    And one of the questions that will be arbitrated, I take it, is whether that December 17th contract, because of its retroactivity provisions, provides damages for what happened in July.   And part of that will require the arbitrator to interpret the December 17th contract --         -- to decide whether it does cover that event of July 2nd.                Now, what has this got to do -- I mean, I would have thought -- is that - I mean, what is your argument?        So, why isn t --         I think people are not communicating.     Imagine on December 17th you and I enter into a contract and it's all written in red, all right?   And one of these red sentences says:                I will pay you $32 extra an hour from the moment that the blue contract went into effect.             See? Now, whether -- that moment when the blue contract went into effect is a question, isn't it, that we would turn over to the arbitrator, the person who is arbitrating the meaning and application of the red contract.     That's simply a question of fact and contractual meaning like any other. Now, what have I said that's wrong?           Why is that a difficult issue?    I can easily modify the hypothetical.              The red contract says:       Joe Smith will be paid $32 extra an hour from the moment when this red contract takes effect. Okay?     And, now we have an issue, when everybody's agreed, we'll send the meaning of the contract to arbitration.          We ll send the application of the contract to -- to arbitration.                One of the questions is:       When, for purposes of the $32, did this contract, which we have admittedly signed, take effect?    Why isn't that question for an arbitrator? Is there any authority at all --           -- anywhere that says it isn't -- I can't -- I can't even know what authority - what reasoning it would be.         I thought of another way of putting this because I am having a hard time with it. You and I could do this, couldn't we?              We could try to enter into a contract on May 1, and who knows what happens, we disagree about what happened, and by the way that had an arbitration clause in it.              Now, whether -- since we disagree about it, that would go to the judge, whether we formed that contract with its arbitration clause, because everything's up in the air. A year later, we enter into another contract, and what that contract says is, we are going to arbitrate every dispute between us, including that old dispute about whether there was that old contract, okay?   And we could do that, and then you would -- you would certainly arbitrate the issue of contract formation, even for the old one, because we said we would do it, right?         Okay.      So why isn't the December 17th contract that second contract in respect to the July 2nd?          Well, that may be, but then you might have -- then you d have a remedy in State court.   I think the argument was that -- anyway, I have this argument:     301 doesn't pre-empt anything but the contract claim. Now, go bring your claim in State court. You might have a good claim in State court that isn't pre-empted.   Suppose one of their employees hit somebody over the head.       You d have a great claim, and that isn't going to be pre-empted.                 Now, yours might be, because there is a set of tort actions in State court that the labor acts pre-empt; in particular, those that involve conduct that is arguably protected or arguably forbidden by the labor acts. So, if you fall outside that category, you are not pre-empted.     And if you fall inside the category, you should be pre-empted; not by 301, but by the labor law which gave this kind of decision to the labor board to make.     What is -- is that argument sensible?    Is it right?    What do you think?
08-1224 +++$+++ 
08-1301 +++$+++           Well, what is the basic purpose of this statute?       I'm having a hard time with it.   Is it -- is the purpose of the statute to try to get a lot of people to register who haven't registered at all?   Or is the purpose of the statute to get the people who had registered in one State and then moved, and make sure they register in another State?          No, I mean, if they are just trying to get people to register in general, and they are not particularly worried about travel, then they are using this travel as a kind of jurisdictional hook.            And if they are using it as a jurisdictional hook, they d like to get everybody, as many as possible.          That argues against you.             I -- I have a hard time seeing just what they re aiming at.             Basically, at the time they passed this --             -- most States didn't require registration.           Would you say this at the moment -- you may not know, but I think it would be helpful.   At the time this was passed, would you say almost all States had some kind of registration act?           Yes.     Okay.           Now, thinking of that -- thinking of that set of registration acts in virtually every State, did most of those or none of them or a few of them or how many made it required that a person register who had committed a crime, a sex crime, in a different State and had moved to that State?            Most, all of them, none of them?          Universally.          All right.     So -- so, therefore, every person who has committed a sex offense, or almost everyone, would have been subject to a requirement to move when he committed the offense and would have been subject to a requirement to register when he moved under some law.           Now, Congress's purpose then must have been just to try to get uniformity here.           It doesn't.   He said, first the crime has to take place, before the travel.         And, moreover, there s a statutory limitation, because after a certain period of years, you don't have to register anymore.           So the hypotheticals about the infant and 20 years ago are out, because the longest it could last is 15 years.           And then you wouldn't have committed the crime as an infant, so there we are. But it's still a long time, 15 years, I grant you.

08-1322 +++$+++               Is there a way for the lawyer -- a lawyer sees that his client has a good case against the government, and thinks he can get an EAGA fee, so he says to the client:                I'd like to represent you and I can get paid for this.                 But the client says: There are a lot of debts I owe the government. Now, is there any way they can work it out so he can get the representation?              What?               In other words, the lawyer and the agency and the client sit down, and the lawyer says:   Here, I can get some money for this client and that will help everybody, but I want to be paid.              So I want you, Agency, to agree that on the repayment schedule if I get an EAGA fee, then I get to keep it and I don't have to give it to my client, who will have to give it to the government.             And then they can sign a piece of paper and then that's done and the lawyer gets to keep the money.               And has that ever happened?             But it could now.   Now people would know about, and they could do it.

08-1371 +++$+++           Doesn t this say the opposite?   It says we are -- you have to let anybody in -- anybody -- regardless of their status or beliefs.                      So you can't discriminate on the basis of status or belief.                That's what the policy says I just read.                It doesn't say you can; it says you can't.            That's what you say, but that's not what the policy says.               The policy says that you have to let everybody in, regardless of their status or belief.            So you cannot discriminate on the basis of status or belief.            -- you have to -- you have to let these organizations discriminate on the basis of belief.    And they say:            No, we don't want to; that's too complicated for us to figure out which ones we should, which ones we shouldn't.                 We'd rather let them work off-campus.    We just don't want to get into this business.    It's not just against religion.              It might be against a Turkish-speaking society that thinks Turkish is extremely important to speak or a chess club that thinks the same.   It could be a lot of people. Now, why do you -- what's wrong with us, a First Amendment -- an organization itself affected with First Amendment interests, saying we just don't want to have those on campus organizations, too much trouble.          That's their way of doing that.          Let me make an imaginary example, and that s --              If -- if a homosexual person said, I want to belong to this club, and I believe in its principles, I don't believe in sexual relationships before marriage, and that's why I want to work for homosexual marriage, which I do, so my consistency there, is that person -- I am consistent in what I work for, what I believe, and on -- as far as premarital sex is concerned, it's totally 100 percent with your organization that you are representing; would they admit that person or not?               He shares the belief that there should be no premarital sex --               -- and he says that's why I am working for Proposition 8 or whatever the proposition, or against it --                I'm working to legalize homosexual marriage in which --                So they would not -- the answer is no, that person --                No, he's not --                -- because his sexual conduct --                -- he will refrain until marriage is made lawful --                That person.  educational theory.             They say that we are going to apply that to everybody because that's how we do it.               And --             -- if there are any ideological organizations that suffer --             -- so be it, but it's fantastical, and therefore --  -- of that program.              -- my question is, if I can think of this policy -- but I tend to sympathize with your view that it's so hard to believe that they really hold it, maybe they do, I don't know about it -- what do I do with this case? How can I say whether this, let's call it "hug your neighbor policy" is -- to put a label on it that's catchy --              -- how do I -- how do I evaluate that?
08-1394 +++$+++             How do you say we -- in your opinion, if we agreed with your basic idea -- if, which is totally hypothetical.          If we agreed with that, how would we sketch the lines?        That is, when does the jury -- does the judge have to do more than is ordinary, and what counts as more than ordinary?            I mean, I -- what I have fear of, to put it out for you, is that jury selection can go on a very long time.          And judges have to -- have to run their trials.     And if we tell the judges that they have got to do more, that will become exaggerated, and they ll administer it in a way that will make it hard to select juries. That's the harm I'm worried about.           So I'm asking you, how would you sketch a line that prevents that harm?        I didn't ask you -- I just asked you to do your best.        So we ve got the wave of public passion --        And what about the second half?        All right.       Now, what's the second half?    The second half, which I'm really worried about, is that we get into the business of running the trial court's trials.     So I want to know what it is that the trial court at that stage, in your opinion, other than transfer, has to do?          What happens if -- I gather -- that a -- that a trial judge has a panel in front of him and people say, yes, I think he is guilty?               And -- and the trial judge says, now, if you listen to the presumption, can you be fair?   You look him in the eye, and if he says, yes, I can put this aside, trial judges do accept those jurors. Now, if that is the practice, and others would know more than me, then our -- our -- I'm worried about changing that ordinary practice.          Then on 932, she does answer it, and says,  He's assumed innocent.                  And can you conscientiously carry out that assumption?                    I could honestly say I will give it my best.          And so the judge looks her in the eye and says -- fine.          I see.       And I'll --          I'll read that again.           But my question is, can we get a hold of these 238 questionnaires? Are they in the record in front of us?
08-1402 +++$+++          The -- I don't know if this is relevant or how to use it, but years ago, I took a course in this kind of thing at the Kennedy School.         I was teaching, and they said the only way you could figure out what -- what's what here is you use something called  binomial theorem,  and you have to have, like, urns, and you imagine that there s an urn with 1,000 balls, and 60 of them are red, and 940 are black, and then you select them at random, and -- and 12 at a time.   You know, fill 12 -- fill a hundred with 12 in each. And when we tried to do that, just for the interest of it, I -- I found that you would expect, with these numbers, something like a third to a half of juries would have at least one black person on it. Now, that may be wrong, because I am not a mathematician, but -- but putting that together, it looks as if there is a pretty big disparity.         On the other hand, that isn't what they testified to, so I guess you re going to tell me just ignore it and forget it.        Well, you know, maybe it s the only way to do it, that the statistician stays with these urns, which I guess they have computer programs for.        I -- I don't know, in other words, and maybe I should just -- I hate to write something, like, saying 2 and 2 is 6.        No.     You can skip it, if you want.    If there's any comment, fine.          For example, it had the example of, like, the eight:             There are eight out of a hundred, and you run this thing a thousand times, and you ll discover that there is one black juror on about half the juries, or a third, anyway.              That's much more than I would have thought intuitively.             And I might not have even read the example correctly.              So you see why I -- I m at sea, as soon as you tell me to be a statistician.    I even got a book called Statistician for Lawyers.    That didn't help me very much. (Laughter.)           Okay.       So, is there anybody who said whether -- if all -- they all take their jurors first, the districts, and Grand Rapids uses a higher percentage of jurors.              So now there -- and they have more of the black jurors, so that there are fewer left over --           That could be.       Now, is there any -- in this record, does anybody say whether that's okay or not?     I mean, to -- to have people serve jury duty near where they live or nearer where they live, on its face, is not so bad.              Did -- did anybody say whether this is good or bad?         Are you --
08-1423 +++$+++        You are talking about the first sale doctrine.     The perfectly consistent rationale would be whether there is a first sale.     So -- so 109, though it doesn't say it, but if you look at the history and title, there has to be a transfer. So in fact, if a British publisher with a British right given by an American author or publisher makes this, 109 doesn't apply -- I mean, 109 doesn't apply until there's a sale. Now, that makes -- you -- you haven't adopted that.     Nobody -- I guess maybe one of the amicus briefs does, but I don't see why that isn't perfectly sensible and I find no authority against it.       I know it is, but it -- the trouble with your position is it gets everybody, I think, going to be -- I mean, I don't know what all these contracts say.     There are hundreds of thousands of them, if not millions.     What I don't see is why you don't just say:     The first sale doctrine has always meant there was a transfer or sale. It meant that in 1792, when I took Phil Arita's antitrust course, and he used to bring it up. You go back to the 18th century.     It's always meant there has to be a sale or transfer.     So why don't we just read 109 that way, and there you give meaning to everything, and there is just no problem? Now, I raise that not because -- I raise it because since there's only a few people really supporting this, there must be some problem with what I say.     So what is it?       Of course, if you say there has to be a first sale, there is no problem.     You block that British manufacturer from sending his books to the United States, but you don't block the person to whom he sells it.     Gives meaning to everything.       I mean, no, I'm putting that to you, because since you haven't advocated it, I must be missing something, and I'm not an expert in copyright law.     What am I missing?       Oh, you mean you are talking about jobbers?     Somebody goes and buys, and so they're -- and so then you lose, because if that's what we are supposed to follow, those excerpts in the legislative history, then it would mean that a person who buys from the British publisher cannot import into the United States because 109 doesn't apply.       I have to say, I didn't even see it in the legislative history.     I didn't think they made a big deal about jobbers.     I like history here.     Go back to 1792.       I do read legislative history, but I didn't really find anything that said that they were worried about an American and a British publisher dividing rights, and they want them to do that.     There is no problem with that, because there has never been a sale.     So they divide the rights. And there isn't even a problem with -- with buyers from the British publisher, because a reasonable vertically imposed territorial agreement or other restriction on resale is lawful.       And if it's reasonable, they don't even need copyright.       If it isn't reasonable, why should they have it?       That's all you -- yes, I just want you to respond.       Here.     But in Europe, I guess, they were lawful.       I think -- I think it's always been true.       My question really wasn't to argue with you.     My question was:     Where in the legislative history does it say that the point of 602 is to prevent a foreign publisher from selling copies to a distributor and then that distributor resells them to the United States?     I'm not saying it doesn't; it's just that I didn't focus on those particular words directly.       Oh.     In other words, somebody wanted that.     I understand the industry wanted it.     But -- but I -- is there anything in there that suggests that this is what Congress wanted to do, members of Congress?     Even I draw the line somewhere. (Laughter.)
08-1438 +++$+++        What do you say about -- I think I read in one of these briefs that what I think is the most relevant similar statute, RFRA, has been held not to encompass the same word -- not to encompass the monetary relief, and also there was some legislative history where people testified and told Congress at the time that the word "appropriate" won't encompass monetary relief.     Am I remembering that correctly?
08-1448 +++$+++        Why wouldn't you, if necessary, simply say that -- that a -- a video game that appeals to the prurient, shameful, or morbid interests of those 18 or under, but let's take 18, and it's not suitable in the community for those 18, and it has no redeeming importance of any kind, no serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for those 18, that at least as to those, you can't sell it without -- the parent can buy it, but the child can't buy it.     So you can't sell to a 12-year-old something that would be horrible for an 18-year-old.     Is that - would you be willing to accept that, if necessary, to make this okay on its face?       Okay.       But, on the principle, I mean, it's been quite some years, hasn't it, before this -- since this Court has held that one instance that courts -- that the country, legislatures, can regulate are fighting words?     And we regulate fighting words, don't we?       Because they provoke violence.     And the American Psychological Association and the American Pediatric Association have said that certain kinds of video games here create violence when children are exposed.     There are 80 people who think to the contrary.     There are two huge things of meta studies that think that -- not to the contrary.     All right.     So what are we supposed to do?
08-1457 +++$+++                 You should -- you should have a very direct answer to this question. Were you finished, because I don't want to interrupt that train of thought?             Can you -- can you -- if you are right, it seems to me you should have a very clear, concise answer to the question that I'm just going to ask you.     And this is the question:                    Imagine that there was no delegation, none.                       Now we have five members; is that right?          One of them dies.               So there is a vacancy.     Now, can the remaining four exercise the board's power?             Clearly.         Okay.   So what is the difference between the situation I just described and this situation where the Board simply delegated its power to three people and one of them dies?                       What's the difference?     I can't find any difference in the language.     So what is the difference?             Correct.             Except that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to the first sentence, which says "The board is authorized to delegate to any group of three all of the powers which it may itself exercise. " So, what's the difference?              Well, I know that, but I'm asking why does that make a difference?              Except.             Then what is the reason -- I now see.     Your answer to my question is that the vacancy clause applies to the full board but not to the group.             Okay.        Now, got that answer.     And now I see how you could read the statute that way.     So, now I would like -- and that would be in your favor.             And -- and, therefore, I would like to know, since you could also read it the other way, why should it be read your way?                    I mean, I can think of a lot of reasons why not.                    One is something that Justice Scalia was raising:                  It may work havoc as to what remains effective, what doesn't, what about the board staff decisions, which are, which aren't.                       I can see a lot of reasons for not doing it. But what are your best reasons for reading that vacancy clause the way you want me to read it?             So I would have thought, but this is only me -- other people don't necessarily go in for this kind of argument.            But in thinking of the - the -- the arguments in your favor, the one that sort of resonated a bit with me was that this is a very Republican Congress in 1947 that passed Taft-Hartley, and one of the things they were really aiming at was to move the board from three to five.                 And this is a way so that that just doesn't happen. But I assume from the briefs filed that there is no supporting legislative history for that, what I've just said, so I better wipe it out of my mind. (Laughter.)
08-146 +++$+++                What are the instances in which somebody who is not a signatory might seem to have a right to enforce it?       I can think of one.           Suppose he's a third-party beneficiary of the contract.                Are there others?               What?               Okay.               I mean, which one applies here?             Estoppel?        I don't understand estoppel.             I know what estoppel is in the law. (Laughter.)             I know, but I haven't unfortunately had a chance to read all the practice treatises.    So could you explain to me quite simply what is the theory of equitable estoppel that allows someone who is not a signatory to an arbitration contract to have it enforced?              In other words, whenever I sign a contract with anybody -- I sign one with Smith, I ask him to buy some wheat, I sell him some wheat, and there's an arbitration clause.                And now I sue all kinds of other people, and the contract is part of the lawsuit.    Are there many cases like that?               Maybe it was a shipper, or something, who they sent the contract to, and he had to figure out what to do on the basis of the contract.    Or maybe there was a cousin who told me to go to see Smith in the first place.                 Maybe -- I don't know. There are a lot of people.            So, now all those people have to go to arbitration? Because you're saying whenever I go in and have a contract with X and there's an arbitration clause, then in any future lawsuit where I sue anybody and that contract is an essential part of it, the breach thereof, he could put me in arbitration.                    Boy, that sounds extreme.   I mean, I guess there are -- there'd have to be several treatises on this, but it doesn't sound intuitively sensible.                Oh, okay.        That's all I wanted to know is what's the theory in this case.                If that's the theory, I -- unless I think it always applies, I could just say I don't have to decide about a third-party beneficiary.                I just have to decide whether you can enforce it.              Now -- so you'd better say some other things. (Laughter.)              I wouldn't have asked my question if you hadn't said we have to go beyond the question whether they had jurisdiction and answer the merits, which is whether you can in fact enforce it.              Now you're saying, no, we don't.              I could just rely on my third-party beneficiary example?
08-1470 +++$+++            That happened about 2 hours and 15 minutes into the exercise, didn't it?           Okay.       So -- so what we have here is a course of conduct, 2 hours and 15 minutes of saying nothing.             Would you say that that s -- that's gone past the point where --             In Butler he said talk to you, but I am not signing any forms.             What they say is,  a course of conduct  -- we will not hold --  This does not mean a defendant's silence, coupled with an understanding and a course of conduct indicating waiver, may never support a conclusion....           But the prosecution's burden is great.           But going back to Justice Sotomayor's question, is there anything during the 2 hours and 15 minutes that could suggest a waiver?           I thought Miranda held that you can't question a person unless he waives his right.           You can question him even after he -- it's clear that he hadn't waived his right. Is that -- that's Miranda?          Or at least that's unclear? Is that --           No, I'm not talking about the waiver.     I'm saying, imagine that it's clear that a person hasn't waived his right.             Now let's suppose he says, "I do not waive my right."             Okay? Now, is it clear law that once he says "I do not waive my right," the police cannot continue to question him?          Is that clear law, yes or no?          Okay, yes.    If that's clear law, would you say that at some point before the 2 hours and 15 minutes expires where they're continuously asking him questions and he says nothing, that it has become clear that he has not waived his right?          For the question is not this.     The question is whether, after 2 hours and 15 minutes of silence, it is clear -- it's nothing about Supreme Court law.     Supreme Court law is clear:           You cannot question him after he makes clear he hasn't waived his right.     So then the question becomes, is it reasonable for a State court to say -- after 2 hours and 15 minutes of asking questions and he says nothing, is it reasonable to hold that he has not -- conclude that he has not waived his rights?             Is that the question?          What would you do with Miranda's statement "But a valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused" -- I grant you, as modified in Butler to say that the State has a heavy burden of showing that the silence followed by a confession -- the State has a heavy burden of showing that that is an affirmative waiver.           Now, those I think are the two statements of law, the third being that after, if there is no waiver, the police cannot continue to question.     Now, I thought that was the clear law.           I grant you, you might argue for a change in the law.            Why do you say it would change the police's behavior?           Inbau and Reid and, you know, the -- the NAC -- the Defense Lawyers  brief here is filled with quotations from typical police manuals, and they all seem to say things like you have to have at -- once the waiver is given, the police may proceed with interrogation.   That seems to be what police today are instructed across the country. It says you cannot question people until he indicates after the warning is given a willingness to answer questions.   That's the police manual. So why do you say this would extract a price on law enforcement when the typical police manuals seem to say what the Petitioner here is saying?           I mean the Respondent.           Which -- which are the police manuals that go your way?           Because I want to look at those, too.          But I don't think that was the question.   The question, at least as I understood it, is that Miranda says you cannot admit a confession into evidence unless he has first waived it.          Then it says, clearly, that even if the police and the prosecution testify he did waive it, even if they say he did, explicitly, still, if there's a long questioning, even then, the court should be very careful about admitting it.          And doesn't it flow from that a fortiori that if he doesn t admit it and all there is, is the long questioning that, there has been no waiver?          He answered three questions.          All right.       One, do you believe in God?   Yes. Two, do you pray to God?            Yes. Three, have you asked God for forgiveness for shooting the boy?      Yes. Okay.   So, where -- where did he waive it?          So, in this case, after 2 hours and 15 minutes when he gave the answers I just said, when did he waive his Miranda rights?          No, I think any then -- then Miranda is --         It says you can't admit the stuff after a long questioning unless he waives.               Obviously, he says something or there would be nothing to admit.

Hypothetical one, your clients, let's say, or some other people, know that what the Kurds' hypothetical plan is, is to pretend they're a political advocacy organization, but to go around shooting the people who don't agree with them.   Okay?   Case one, the hypothetical defendant knows it.    In case two, he doesn't know it, but it's true.
08-1521 +++$+++            Okay.        How does that work? I think that would be useful for either you or Mr. Clement, if you've thought this through.                Is this right different from others?           There are two ways.        One is that -- look at -- all you have to do is look at the briefs.   Look at the statistics.           You know, one side says a million people killed by guns.               Chicago says that their -- their gun law has saved hundreds, including -- and they have statistics -- including lots of women in domestic cases.   And the other side disputes it.               This is a highly statistical matter.            Without incorporation, it's decided by State legislatures; with, it's decided by Federal judges. Now, think of this, too:               That when you have the First Amendment, or some of the other amendments, there s always a big area where it's free speech versus a whole lot of things, but not often free speech versus life.     When it's free speech versus life, we very often decide in favor of life.          Here every case will be on one side guns, on the other side human life.            Statistics, balancing life versus guns.            How are Federal judges in your opinion, rather than legislatures in the States in a Federal system -- how are Federal judges supposed to carry this out?     I want to see where we re going.            Heller, I didn't think, explained that with great -- I was dissenting, though.    I didn't think it explained it with total clarity, but that's a dissenter's view. (Laughter.)            Let me be specific, suppose Chicago says, look, by banning handguns not in the hills, not hunting, nothing like that, nothing outside the city -- in the city, we save several hundred human lives every year.     And the other side says, we don't think it is several hundred, and, moreover, that doesn't matter.   How do you decide the case?           You re saying they can have -- no matter what, that the City just can't have guns even if they re saving hundreds of lives -- they can t ban them.          But there is a difference.          There is a difference here with the other amendments.        There is a difference, and the other amendments -- you have the First Amendment s, the First Amendment expression. Here we have right in the amendment written a militia-related clause.       And the way that -- the way -- the way that the right might be incorporated in respect to that is light years different from the way it might be interpreted if you think what it is, is the right to have a gun to shoot a burglar.          They re just two separate things. And as to the first, it's pretty hard for me to see why you d incorporate it, for reasons I won't go into.   As to the second, I understand it.         So we re starting with a difference in purposes at the least. And shouldn't that make a difference in how you incorporate?           Because the -- one of the reasons --           -- at least, is that -- you ve read, I'm sure, that all the law professors at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, London, et cetera, that say even Blackstone in the 17th century thought that this is primarily a right to raise an army through Parliament to -- well, I can't go on here.           I'm just saying think of that brief, and you ll see the differences, even accepting Heller.

08-1553 +++$+++           Is this the language?   It says the     -- see if it helps with Justice Scalia's question. The language says "a rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of  the STB  shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it receives."          And so that's what it has to do, is a bill of lading for property it receives. And you are saying "receives" means receives from the shipper.          It does not mean receives from another carrier.          Is that right?           Is -- is there a way to -- are you finished?           We don't even get into this problem if -- unless the ship line is a rail carrier?           Well, it says,  A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the STB  shall issue a receipt or a bill of lading. That's what leads us into the problem.           But mid-carriage -- it only talks about -- they use that word "received."           That's why I thought possibly it didn't because it says --           That's a separate argument?           Did the Ninth Circuit pass on that argument?          Did the Ninth Circuit pass on that argument?          It did not.          So that's not right in front of us?          It's quite different.           How -- how do you get out of the language that says that a rail carrier providing transportation  shall issue a receipt  for property it receives? Now, the boat, oddly enough, is a rail carrier under the definition.           And, therefore, it should have issued -- since you agree it's a receiving character, it should have -- or -- it should have issued a bill of lading, that then, if it's within Carmack, as I've just tried to put it, requires it to have certain things in it that they say aren't there.        Oh, yes, right; and now we see a rail carrier --       You can get the definition there, and it includes somebody who provides intermodal equipment.    And you look at transportation, and transportation includes services related to that equipment.        Ah, now all right.      Fine.        But --        Now just give me how -- what I would write in the opinion that would in fact -- because what they did here, the ship, is it took a container and put it on the train.     Okay?        So that's inter-service equipment.     What's the language that does it your way?
08-1555 +++$+++            Suppose that the -- the Department of the Army orders clothes for the soldiers at a time when the department is a separate agency of Government X in 1940.      In 1950, this department is bought by the Dior clothing company. Now, it's a private entity, and someone would like to sue the department because they didn't pay the bill.    It is now a private entity.              They are suing them for what happened years ago when they were part of the state. Is it sovereign immunity, this statute that blocks the suit, or some other principle?          The statute would block the suit.    There s precedent with -- you know, famous precedent with King Farouk, which says the opposite.                It says:    You were king, you are not king now; therefore, there may be a different principle, but we can sue you now.          All right.        And you re saying if a state disappears, it no longer exists, so you couldn't possibly be interfering.               You couldn't possibly be interfering in the workings of the state --          -- you still can't sue anybody --         -- who was part of the official operation --           -- even though there is no present interference?           Why?     Why?         Because if the state doesn't exist, why is there any stronger reason than in the incident where the entity is no longer part of the state?           Oh, no, you may have act of state doctrine.    At that point, the State Department comes in and says:    You can't maintain this suit because of the act of state doctrine for the very reason you ve said.            And that's my question you need the act of state doctrine or does this statute cover it which removes the discretion from the Executive Branch to decide on a case-by-case basis?          Why can't you say that if the person, the individual you are suing, is a member of the foreign state, is engaged in the kind of activity that you re complaining about, is subject to the orders of the foreign state, and the relief would affect the foreign state, you are suing the foreign state? But where he was a member of the foreign state, and you want money from him, even though what he did in the past was an act of a foreign state, this lawsuit is not affecting him in his capacity -- is not affecting the foreign state.             Indeed, there isn't even one.   So in the first set, he falls in the FSIA.            In the second set, he doesn't.      And you happen to have the second set, and, therefore, he may still be immune for what he did in the past, but that would be a different docket.             That -- that's where this is all leading me.
08-1569 +++$+++            What is this to do -- I mean, the obvious question, to me, is -- since I wrote the -- I think I wrote the opinion in Castillo -- is we looked at the language of the statute, very similar to this, and we said:     Machinegun means a separate crime. And they recodified it.      And it looks to me as if all they did was take the things that we previously said were separate crimes and put them in (B), and take the things that are obviously sentencing factors and put them in (A) and (C). All right.      Now, that's what it looks like if you just read the statute.            I didn't find anything in the history that suggested any other intent.            So why do you think that that change makes the difference?          To make your life a little more complicated and difficult, though perhaps it makes it easier, we reach the questions that Justice Scalia was raising, I think, and they are important only if you win, only if we say that it is a sentencing factor.          If it is a new crime, we don't have any problem, because if it's a new crime, the jury has to find the fact. But if it's a sentencing factor, then we get into the problem of Harris versus Apprendi.         And then you have to decide whether it's maximum, minimum, et cetera. But in Harris, I said that I thought Apprendi does cover mandatory minimums, but I don't accept Apprendi.          Well, at some point I guess I have to accept Apprendi, because it's the law and has been for some time. So if and in fact, unfortunately for everyone, I was -- it was 5-4 in that, I think, so my vote mattered, and I don't know what other people think but in -- on this Court.      But if that becomes an issue, if that should become an issue about whether mandatory minimums are treated like the maximums for Apprendi purposes, should we reset the case for argument?          Or do you feel, in your opinion that -- that you ve had enough of an argument because you devoted two or three pages to this topic?          Well, I think basically Apprendi did significantly change MCMillan, but that s --          Does the government believe that it has sufficiently argued this, or would you suggest on the government's behalf that if it becomes an issue it's set for reargument?        That was really my question.          Is there anything other -- do we have anything other than the statute itself?   When I looked at the statute itself, I thought, well, all that's happened here is nobody's thought of this issue at all; nobody's read Castillo.         What really happened is somebody in the legislative drafting section was focusing on what he said they were focusing on, Bailey, and then they have a form manual.         So they followed the form manual. Now, is there anything to suggest that isn't what happened?

08-205 +++$+++              And the individual contribution also covers people who would like to give $2500 instead of $2400, which is the limit.              And maybe there are 100 million or 200 million people in the United States who, if they gave 2500 rather than 2400, nobody could say that that was really an effort to buy the Senator or the Congressman.             So is that unconstitutional, too?             Yes.             Yes.             So here the obvious argument is:    Look, they said the compelling interest is that people think that representatives are being bought, okay?    That's to put it in a caricature, but you understand what I'm driving at, okay?                   That's what they said in Buckley v. Valeo.          So Congress now says precisely that interest leads us to want to limit the expenditures that corporations can make on electioneering communication in the last 30 days of a primary, over-the-air television, but not on radio, not on books, not on pamphlets, not on anything else.                   All right? So in what respect is there not conceptually at least a compelling interest and narrow tailoring?               It's important --               Well, of course, it did -- was a basis for prohibiting speech by, in the sense of giving contributions above $2,400, by 300 million people in the United States.       But the point, which I think is the one that Justice Kennedy was picking up, is are we arguing here between you and my questions, is the argument in this case about the existence of a compelling interest?      Because Congress seemed to think that there was certainly that; it's this concern about the perception that people are, say, buying candidates. Are we arguing about narrow tailoring? Congress thought it was narrow tailoring.              Or are we arguing about whether we should second-guess Congress on whether there is enough of a compelling interest and the tailoring is narrow enough?              Yes.             If that is so -- this is a point that is concerning me.            I don't know the answer precisely.     But suppose you are right.                Suppose we overrule these two cases.           Would that leave the country in a situation where corporations and trade unions can spend as much as they want in the last 30 days on television ads, et cetera, of this kind, but political parties couldn't, because political parties can only spend hard money on this kind of expenditure?                   And therefore, the group that is charged with the responsibility of building a platform that will appeal to a majority of Americans is limited, but the groups that have particular interests, like corporations or trade unions, can spend as much as they want? Am I right about the consequence?                 If I am right, what do we do about it?              No, I'm not -- I'm not -- I am saying am I right in thinking that if you win, the political party can't spend this money, it's limited to hard money contributions, but corporations and trade unions can spend unlimited funds?            No, I'm not suggesting that.   I am suggesting we will make a hash of this statute, and if we are going to make a hash of this statute, what do we do about it?                And that's why I want you to take a position on another important part of that statute, and that is the part that says political parties themselves cannot make these expenditures that we are talking about except out of hard money.              Actually I read that sentence that you just read as meaning the corporation is an artificial person in respect to which the State creates many abilities and capacities, and the State is free also to create some disabilities and capacities. Not a statement about balancing rich and poor.
08-214 +++$+++                  Is -- how many -- how many would you say there are in a typical year, maintenance and cure cases?     About, roughly?              I mean, say in the late twentieth century, 18 -- 1980, 1990.                 Have you have any guess at all?              All right.              So how many would you guess?              Uh-huh.          And they usually have maintenance and cure aspects.              Can you get punitives under the Jones Act or not?              What about unseaworthiness?              Okay, so if I have about 30 cases -- no, I had, actually, to be honest, I thought we found about 12 in the period around 1980 - 2000 where they do give some punitive damages.                All right.       Then I found about 10 cases in the period before the Jones Act where there was something given -- punitive damages being given for something, and there was something sort of like maintenance and cure in there.                Over here, there is one called -- Unica v U.S.         The master should have put the -- into the hospital.        Given him $1,500.            It was partly punitive.   Considering -- De Troupe -- I mean, I found some that are sort of -- sort of -- I don't know what to say.   I don't know who to make of it.              The Troop gave them $4,000. Considering all the circumstances of the aggravation. Gross neglect, mistreatment.           "It is useless to parade more of the sickening details."

08-267 +++$+++               But suppose -- suppose that the problem was a professional soldier convicted a certain number of years ago of a particular crime, a few years later through some amazing mistake they wrote the wrong number down.      The clerk just wrote the wrong number of the code provision.               That's all.              And it made it a felony instead.   It was actually a misdemeanor.                 What's he supposed to do?     I mean, normally you go back to the Court and say:    Judge, you know, they just made -- everyone admits it's a simple transcribing error.                     Would you please correct it?         Now, how -- how is that supposed to work in the military?              Yes.      No, he's -- he's finished his sentence.         This is several years ago.             They just now discovered it, and it could affect him in the future that it happened in fact to be a misdemeanor he was convicted of.     But the -- the code section they wrote down is a felony.              Yes.      Yes, that's right.              No, this is 7 years. (Laughter.)              He can't even do that.         So nobody in the military, in fact, once their thing is final -- then it has nothing to do with it, in your view, that he has left the military?              You are saying -- you are saying, whether you are in the military, whether you are out of the military, no matter how egregious, no matter how obvious, there is no route for a military person, a professional, to go and get an obvious error corrected if -- if he has missed the statute, that there was an -- the civil statute of limitations, it's hard for him to go to the Tucker Act.      He's been in the Philippines the entire time.             Yes, it happened.       It really happened.             What I'm trying to do is suggest that I think you -- I can't quite decide what stool you want to rest on.          Part of this you say, well, he's a civilian that has left the military.                 And then I read that.   It seems to have nothing to do with it.                   But your other argument seems to be that doesn't matter.             No military soldier can correct an error, no matter how egregious, even a technical -- you know, they just wrote the wrong thing down, because Congress didn't want them to.                 Now, I doubt that Congress thought about that.                 I'm just not sure they didn't want them to.
08-289 +++$+++                Nogales was doing great?          I mean, I asked my clerk to go get some figures out of the record and she says in 2008 in the sixth grade, just to take an example, 77 percent of the English learners in Nogales failed the tests as compared to 32 percent statewide.   In the tenth grade 84 percent failed the reading exam compared with 34 percent statewide.                   In 2008 the reading exam fourth graders, 67 percent failed in Nogales, the English learners, compared to 30 percent statewide. Now, I'm sure that progress has been made, but it doesn't seem to me, looking at that kind of thing -- and the record is filled with that kind of thing -- that that -- that you could say that the objectives are achieved.              Well, isn't the point of this to teach the children to learn English?                He doesn't actually have the right to ask me questions. (Laughter.)              All right.       Let's take the one you mentioned. Let's take the one you mention.                   The one you mentioned, I take it the student academic achievement in mathematics, which is something called the AYP guidelines test, they are for high school, which you mentioned.     It has -- I think it's 2008, maybe it's 2007 -- we have limited English proficient students, this is passing their test, 22.4 percent of the English learners are at students scoring at or above proficient. The overall rate is 68 percent.                So it seems like about a third. Now, if you look at the reading language arts, the average is 73.5.            Limited English proficient is 15.4.     And that's quite a difference, 75 percent as to 15.4, in the high schools, on the tests that you have mentioned. So I just say -- my only point is that we have a couple of findings here; you are right, they have made progress, but they are not quite home yet.                  And I would say that, looking at this record, it seems to suggest that.              Let's do another one.           What they started out in the year 2000 is they said one problem with this State is we don't know what it costs the average -- the increased program.                       They haven't done a good study to tell what it costs.                       But we think it's somewhere around $1500, maybe it's $1300, maybe it's $1400 per student.      And as of this very moment, the State is providing 3 to $400, leaving it up to the school district to find the rest of the money, which it has to take from other things like English, or -- is that right?                What is the one State funding?   Because I looked at your brief, page 22 to 23, and if I understand it correctly it says that the educational expenditures, that is to say monies, increased in this Nogales and USD --                -- maintenance and operation budget, by 30 percent.                 Well, I'm sure they did.   But that's I take it the entire maintenance and operation budget.     The numbers I had -- and I am quite interested to know if they are wrong -- the numbers that I have is that the only survey they've done across the State, or the most recent one, says that the English language instructional costs range between 1570 and $3300 per pupil.    And then if you look at the amount the State provides outside of the reading, writing and arithmetic, which they provide, et cetera, for all students, what they provide is -- currently it's $340, and if that law had gone into effect, 2064, it would have been $450.    Now, are those numbers totally wrong?              There is a minor thing that I -- I think -- I'm not sure that Justice Ginsburg said. I thought that the funding order was not fund the plan you come up with; but rather, come up with a funding plan that bears a rational relationship to -- to the plan you come up with.      So is that right?              All right.       And now the district court is at considerable remove.                He says they have not yet come up with a study and a plan that seems satisfactory, and they haven't shown how the funding is rational in relation to the plan that they haven't fully developed, though they've made progress.                That's where we are -- is that where we are?
08-295 +++$+++                Is there anything you want to say about the practical thing I have in the back of my mind which may be false?             That language permits your position, but it certainly has rarely been implemented, if ever.   And I see that, but in the back of my mind is the fact that if we start mucking around and give narrow meanings to these things now, there are going to be hundreds of thousands of people who won't get compensated who have asbestos --               Is that true?               Is there anything to back that up?               I said that.
08-304 +++$+++               The arguments in this case, my initial reading of them, are more balanced than any I can remember, really.         For each one, there is a counterargument and I'm somewhat left up in the air. So if -- since we have to decide it, it should -- should I take this into account:              That if the Respondents are right, you are absolutely correct that there will be a lot of people, perhaps, who get rewards at the Federal Government's expense who shouldn't have them.    No question.      They front-run the government. They read the report, run in court fast, before it's in the newspaper. But if you are right, then they are going to have to assign people to look at these obscure administrative reports that didn't even get in the newspaper.    So they want to do that, they don't have people to do it, and they say these people are performing a service of sorts by reading them, the reports, for them and telling them about it.            And there it is, balanced. But they are the ones who suffer.          You see, they suffer both ways.        They suffer if people don't tell them; they suffer if in fact too many people are getting unjustified rewards because the money comes from the Federal Government, the 10 percent, 25 percent.            So if they're the ones who suffer, should I not pay special attention to their views as to how the balance works out?            As you can tell, I have taken that point in.             So my question wasn't that. My question was, Should I or should I not give them a little expertise weight on the grounds that they are the ones who know it best, that they are the victims?             Now, I agree with you about that.   I think it's the silence, though, that might cut against you.             And the reason that it's -- it's basically silence -- the reason I am thinking that cuts against you is because of this sorting of the context where they are focusing on Federal. And, if everybody is working in that context, then nothing said about State means they are just assuming it's all applying to Federal. Now, what I'm looking for, you might be able to put your finger on, is something that shows that my last statement is not right.              I think in the -- it was -- it probably came out in governmental affairs in the Senate, which I think had 17 members at the time.             So your point here is -- I will put it in cash terms, is the Federal government, who will pay a lot of qui tam lawyers some percent to go and look through all these State criminal hearings and State reports and all these things that didn't get into the newspaper and to bring cases, so it may be cheaper to pay them then it would be to hire staff to do that. Now, your point is that they get a little over-enthusiastic sometimes, and they can bring actions that maybe not be so well-justified, and the -- the Federal government is going to have to hire people to sort those out anyway, and so would the States in that kind of mess. Is that your point?
08-305 +++$+++              Well, what happens -- what happens if the hearing officer can't, but why couldn't the court?    I mean, they see an unusual situation.                The parents were justified, and it doesn't say there are no circumstances other than -- where you couldn't -- where they may not pay.     So the judge says, I think this is a situation where it is -- it is equitable to pay the -- the reimbursement.                 Why not?         What says you can't do that, other than your basic point about the "may require"?                 All right.        But anyway, the regs don't say anything about that.                 You're saying the statute says the hearing officer can't do that no matter what. That's a separate argument.              All right.
08-310 +++$+++               May I ask one other question before you leave this, which is where Justice Kennedy started?   Suppose a State says:                In our State, we want to tax all oil and gas property, and here's how we do it.   We assess the value of all oil and gas property, ships and everything else included.                 Then we impose a tax of 20 mills per dollar of assessed value, something like that, on all of it. Now, the State will collect all of it, and we make one exception.       We define which property the State will directly get the money from, and then the city can do the rest, if it wants.                 Now, here's what we do with the State money.         We give it to the city.          So if the city wants to, it can put the same tax on that little bit of property left over, which is a subcategory of oil and gas property.         And by the way, the name of that little bit of property left over is called "a ship." Now, is that a tonnage tax, and is that what Alaska has done here?              I described to you the entire tax.     We know no more about it.              The way it does is just as I said.     And maybe I was -- it was too much for you to take in.     So the point is that it's a tax on oil and gas property.     That's Code section 1.               Code section 2 is defined subcategories -- (a), (b), (c), (d, (e), (f) -- all of that.     Code 3 says (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e). The -- the State government collects and remits it to the city.     (G), the city can assess the same tax if it wishes.     It doesn't have to -- and keep the money.              (G) is ships. And the reason I have asked that question is I read something from a -- Alaska Department of Economic and Community Development which suggested to me that that is Alaska's tax.        I might have that wrong.           I just read a sentence or two, and maybe I am wrong that that is Alaska's tax, and --              But if it's Alaska's tax --              -- what's wrong with it? It's a -- it's a tax on all oil and gas property, and all they do is they let the city collect some of that if they want, and they collect the rest of it and give it to the city.              What I'd like to know is Do you think what I said was a misdescription?              What's worrying me about this aspect of this case is a possible need to send it back to find out what Alaska's tax system is.    Now -- now, if what I just said is a -- is a correct description approximately and if the other side thinks it is, too, then at least I -- I know how to go about deciding it.      And if I don't, I don't know quite what to do.
08-322 +++$+++              No, I'll ask you that question because I'd like to hear your answer to that.              Can I ask you this question for a second, please?        And just take 2 minutes to answer it or not.     You don't have to answer it, but it seems to me this is the question.          This whole issue depends on the evidence before Congress.              So, in reading the briefs, I have six categories of evidence.                  Compared to the City of Rome, the registration turnout still has two States, Virginia and Texas, with significant disparities. As to minority officeholders, there is a big improvement, but if you look at Mississippi, Louisiana, and South Carolina and a couple of others, it is still not great. The DOJ objections:               The number of DOJ objections has fallen a lot, but it still exists. In terms of election observers, which were not mentioned in City of Rome, we have their statistics that two-thirds of the observers are focused on five of the six States that are covered.                        In terms of polarized voting, not mentioned in Rome, we still have testimony that the polarization is significant and common in certain places. And as to successful section 2, section 5 suits, once again not mentioned in the City of Rome, but since 1982 there were at least 105 successful section 5 suits and 653 successful section 2 suits.               All right. I just summarized that because I'd like to hear in a couple of minutes, or five, or whatever you want to take.    I'm trying to lead you to what I think is the heart of the case.        It seems evidentiary.         That is what I read.    What is your response?               Whatever you want.            You should have a chance to answer the same question.          You heard my question, the time question.    What's your estimate?
08-351 +++$+++           I mean, he was just talking about probable cause.      How could that be duplicative?          Look, I thought this case, though I grant you I could well be wrong, is not about a final forfeiture hearing where you have to show that it's more probable than not that the car was used for drugs.   But under the Illinois law, just as Justice Alito said, you can seize a car without a warrant.          And there are lists of circumstances.     But in the Florida statute that Justice Thomas wrote about, it said that a person whose car it is, is entitled to a hearing, I thought, in a brief time to see if there was probable cause, just as a person arrested.     You have to bring them before a magistrate within a short time to see if there's probable cause. Now, how do you do that in Chicago?          So you're saying the answer to the question is there is no way?                A person who doubts this probable cause has no way.              He has to wait 6 months until there's a forfeiture hearing.                He's out of luck because then it merges with the merits.          Okay.        That s your answer. There is no way.          Then I don't see why you win this case.          What?          I mean, is there a way or not?   You have pointed to three statutes.                Do they give him any way?            Look --          Am I right that what is  - what is the rationale your supporting it for the following:   My car was parked on the street.           There happened to be some big drug crime nearby, and the policeman took my car.     In my opinion, there was no probable cause.   I would like my car back. Now, I take it that in Illinois there is no proceeding, as there was in Florida, so that I can claim there was no probable cause, and I -- none at all.              I never get that determination made; and, moreover, I have to wait, for 6 months possibly, before I get a different determination made, which is whether they had  - more likely than not, whether that's entitled to forfeiture on the merit. Is that the law?           If anything like it is the law, what s the constitutional justification for it?          You mean they can keep my car even if it's more likely than not that it was never involved?          But it's still -- okay, fine.          Thank you.       That is   all right.   That's a burden of proof thing at the final thing.   That's not the thrust of my question. The thrust of my question is:             Do I have to wait for up to 6 months before I have any magistrate, any neutral official, pass on my claim there was no probable cause to take my car?          And the Florida statute, by the way, doesn't do that.       It says of course you get a hearing on probable cause.          Am I right?          Okay.        So nobody gives you -- they go around taking cars even without probable cause.   There s no way to do -- it happens in every State. What s the constitutional justification for making a person wait for 6 months before he gets a neutral judicial official to say whether there was even cause to take his car?
08-441 +++$+++               What they are trying to say, which is -- which is making me think -- it is a lot about -- we have a human being who did certain acts. And we know this.    We know that human being had a mix of motives and that the bad motive played a role.            It was a motivating force.    And that might be sufficient.          It is under Title VII.    And if you want to interpret this by Title VII, that's fine.         That's the end of it. But then we are going to let someone off if we imagine a different, but hypothetical, situation. The hypothetical is where the bad motive isn't there. Well, it's hard to prove what human beings would do in a hypothetical situation that isn't the real situation.   And I take it that's the reason we have imposed this burden upon the employer. Is there an analogy to that in tort law?
08-453 +++$+++                How is it supposed to work? This is what is bothering me at the heart of this case. I imagine that banks, particularly right in these last few months, are in situations where there are three categories of -- of borrowers.             One might be a category of people whom you are reasonably confident in, and the second is a category of people who are borderline or less so, and there are also minorities. Now, where you make the decision as a bank to deny them the loan, it sometimes is difficult to say whether that decision was made for a discriminatory reason, namely race, or for a legitimate reason, namely because this was a person unlikely to pay the money back. Now, how is a bank to function if 50 different attorneys general plus the Federal agencies all look at the books of the bank to look at the individual loan and to make that kind of determination about which quite honestly reasonable people will often differ? And how -- how is that really a problem, or am I just creating that?        And if it's really a problem, how in your opinion does the Federal law deal with that problem, if not in the way that your opponent suggests?                If I may say so, that response overlooks the question.                I don't doubt the single standard.   What I do doubt is in the -- in the category of uncertain cases, that 51 different individuals, 50 State attorneys general plus one Federal individual, will reach the same result.                These are hard and, therefore, they will reach a lot of different results under the same standard.                Okay.      So you deny the hypothetical.   You are saying that my analysis of the problem is wrong; there simply is no such problem, and since there is no such problem, it doesn't matter if everyone enforces it.                Is your answer yes or no to what I just said, that you deny that the statement of the problem is realistic and therefore there is no problem in your view about having 51 different people enforce the same standard.                And should such a problem arise, what?               I want to --             You are just at the point of getting to what I -- the blank in my mind.                     And the blank in my mind is when you said, but if there were such a problem, as I had described, but if there were, then they could -- and now that's the blank.                     Then they could what?             For example, just give me two, a couple.               Is it -- could they -- could the Federal authorities pre-empt the State law, in your opinion?
08-472 +++$+++                 I don't see why that's the issue before us.   Look, procedurally this is a little boring, but it seems pretty well established in the law. I read a case called Toledo Scale and then there are a bunch of cases on jurisdiction, which I'm not going to name them because I'm sure you looked at them, but Travelers Indemnity, et cetera.               And it seems to me they make absolutely clear that once a litigant, you and the others, have had an opportunity to raise a matter and now the case is over, done, but for an injunction that stays in, all those issues that they previously raised or could have raised are gone; that the only question left is whether the government has complied with the injunction. So I read the injunction.                    The injunction says the government is enjoined from permitting the display of the Latin cross, period.                      Once this law takes effect and you follow it, you are violating that injunction.     You don't need nine proceedings to see that.     You are violating it. Now, if you don't like the injunction because you think the statute has so changed the circumstances there is no need for it, there is a remedy.     You go back to the district court and you say: Judge, change the injunction.              But you haven't done that.     And therefore, the only question before us is whether the Ninth Circuit is right in saying when you carry the statute into effect, you are violating this injunction, which I think no one could say you aren't. Now, now, that -- that's a very technical boring issue.     I don't know why we heard this issue, but I don't see how we could reach any other issue in this case.             But that's not what I'm talking about.             We are talking about the first.     We are talking about the first injunction.                 The first injunction says that the government may not permit display.     You've covered it up, so you are not permitting display.      You are in compliance.             But what the plaintiff here said is that when you comply with this statute, you will not be in compliance, because you will turn it over to the VFW that will uncover it, so you will have permitted it to be displayed.      Now, that I can see is an issue before us.     But I don't see any other issue before us.             But just I want to just get this clear procedurally.          I'm sorry.             It'll take one more second. As I read this, there is no modification of any injunction.     What the -- what the Respondent asked for, he said:     Judge, either hold that the transfer violates the current injunction, or modify the injunction.    Then what the district court did do is he said the proposed transfer violates the permanent injunction.    The permanent injunction is in the, like, the third paragraph of the July 24th order, and it says, you are permanently enjoined from permitting the display of the Latin cross.      Therefore, he rejected the need to modify it, and held that --             -- this violates the injunction as written, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed that. So is there any question in this case of modifying?    Is there any question other than the one that I think Justice Scalia was taking a good argument about, whether the proposed statute violates the July 24th injunction?      That's what the case is about. Or why am I wrong?             Thank you.
08-479 +++$+++                But aren't there things here that are a little extreme?               I mean, if she's to be believed, then she was really naked, and the two administrators deny that, but you have to take her side of the facts.    So taking her side of the facts, why couldn't the school administrators just do what they said they did?    That is, you leave her in her underwear, tell her:   Go shake her underwear.                 No reason to do any more than that.     Or if she is really embarrassed about that, say:     Go put on a swimming suit, you know.               Shake the swimming suit, no problem.                People see you at the beach all the time.       Or call your mother. I mean, you know, we can think of another -- a number of things that seem a lot less restrictive than her version of what went on here.               Yes.               I know, but I mean, here she is embarrassed if -- if what she says happened happened.    There seems no reason for that, and it seems so easy.    Put on your gym clothes, okay?                I mean, she does that every day.        It is just such obvious alternatives to having her be really naked.  So that's what I -- I don't see any basis for saying to the school administrator, you know, you can do that.    You can just turn her naked.                I mean, it just embarrasses her.        What's the need for it?              I know, but she says in the record that they went further and required her to be partly naked beyond just her underwear.                     They say --              Okay.       So that was my question.   My question was:           Why wasn't it?           I wasn't asking about the law.      I was asking:                 Why didn't they choose one of these alternatives?             -- putting things in their underwear.              And a teacher is there thinking what's reasonable?              And I've already got the thing sort of away from -- I see your point.                      I'm not quite talking about that.            I'm worried about what to write in this as a general standard.                      And so am I supposed to say, look, school -- school officials who think that children could hide things in their underwear when they know they're not supposed to have them, is that school official really unreasonable except in a special case?   That's what's bothering me.
08-495 +++$+++  
08-5274 +++$+++               Why?      I can't get anywhere with the language, to tell you the truth.                       I could read it either way.     It -- the House language is the same. The person "discharges," yeah, but what if he discharges it accidentally?    Is the accidental case or unintended case meant to be covered or not meant to be covered?              And you don't get anywhere -- I just can't get anywhere with the language.                       The reason they put the "is discharged" is probably for parallelism.    It was a drafting section in the Senate, and they do their job in a stylistic way.                       I found nothing that suggests anything other than that. So -- so where am I?               Sometimes a person who discharges the weapon accidentally is really much worse than the one who does it purposely.                       Purposely, he shoots at the ceiling; accidentally, he kills a person dead; okay?    So I mean, I can't get too far with that. So where -- so there we are.                     Is there anything else -- there is the post problem that the Chief Justice mentioned.           Is there anything else you can say to me, who really doesn't see it one way or the other way in this statute?                Would you say, look, this is why you win?                Why -- why do you think that?   I mean, it is absolutely true that a person who is a bank robber and has a gun and has already shown it, and it goes off accidentally is, is -- has caused a tremendous harm in certain cases, which traditionally has been thought meriting a higher sentence. And it is also true that he doesn't have the same state of mind as the one who does it purposely. That is true, too.      Both are true.               And so now what should I do?    I know what you want me to do, but why?               It's in relation to the -- I mean, you know, in a sense it is, in a sense it isn't; same problem.              He sees a duck fly by the window and he's a hunter.              Is that helping?       I mean, this did take place during, and you would have thought when something goes off accidentally it's in relation to.   I mean, you know, I can imagine an argument to the contrary, but it isn't obvious.              It just is --              They have during, in relation to and in furtherance of, so their in furtherance of doesn't carry over.                 The first two do. An accidental discharge is it not in relation to the crime?
08-538 +++$+++             In that case -- in that case, I guess there wouldn't be a -- a lawsuit.          I mean, in that case, the debtor is never going to object.            So we're never going to have that one.          Why?    I mean, you sit down with the creditors, and you look at the list and you try to work things out.     That meeting goes on as long as you want.   And if it appears there s an argument about valuation, you file an objection.           If it appears everybody can work everything out, fine.          What's the problem?           The rule is -- and that's what it's about -- the rule is about where you object, the trustee objects to the list.             The list.           That's called Schedule C. If you have an objection to the list, then it says:    Here's what you do, trustee.               Meet with the creditors, try to work it out.            And if in fact 30 days thereafter and you don't need any more time, so you don't ask the judge for more time, file an objection.           What's the problem?          That sounds very complicated.     I -- I mean, the thing that sort of persuaded me so far on this is this is what Collier says, the other side -- it's what all the bankruptcy judges.     Ambro is a bankruptcy judge.           This is a simpler thing.          Look at the procedural rule.     It's just what I ve said.           It says:   If you have an objection to the list of property -- the list of property is C, okay?      So here's what you do, trustee: Sit down with the creditors.              See if there's really an argument.     Now, if there's no argument, fine; they'll let you do what you want. If there is an argument and it has to do with that list, C, particularly valuation, which is what these things are all about, then file your objection. That's so simple.    And it seems in most places they do it. So why do we want to run around Robin's barn or something to get somewhere we can get to much simpler?          But Rule 403 doesn't say that.   My Rule 403 says:      "A party in interest may file an objection to the list of property claimed as  - as exempt within 30 days after the meeting."            Okay?          It says  the list.       So that's where I think you're becoming awfully legalistic, to try to distinguish between the list and the property in A and B. I mean, what do you -- these are about valuation, says Collier.       That's all we're interested in.
08-586 +++$+++              I thought, by reversing that, picking out what the essence was, you would get pretty close to what you are arguing for, without getting into all this thing of whether it's just like a trustee or whether a lawyer should be a trustee or -- you know, there are a lot of questions here that could float around, of any language we use.
08-598 +++$+++               I understand the argument that the issues are not quite the same, that the Atkins issue of mental retardation is not quite the same as the issue that was litigated.           Let's try and get that out of the case.    I think that's where Justice Kennedy was going. Suppose it was a gun case and the Supreme Court originally thought you could convict people who sell drugs of simple possession of a gun.                There's a finding, because it's a bench trial, that he simply possessed but did not otherwise use the gun.                Then the Supreme Court holds that that isn't enough under the statute.   So now the State wants to argue, because the proceeding on appeal or whatever is still going on, we want a second shot at this; we want to show he did more than simply possess.      Is the State bound by what it previously lost on or can the State -- can he get a second shot?              I'm not -- I'm not going to go into double jeopardy.         I don't think necessarily that it's double jeopardy that -- that is relevant here.              But I have a -- have you run into this in a different context?   They wouldn't use the word "double jeopardy." It would be some kind of due process problem.            Maybe there isn't a problem.       Have you run in your research to anything like what I described?
08-6 +++$+++                What now?       As far as I understand, there's a procedural problem.                    I tried to figure out the Heck line once in Balisok.                    My impression of it is that if, Mr. Prisoner, you're bringing an action challenging some confinement or the effect of your action is going to be to let you go out of solitary or out of prison, then proceed your habeas.               But if what you're trying to get is relief that may or may not mean you get out of solitary or you get out of prison, then you go to 1983.     But, by the way, if you're in 1983 you are complaining about an action or inaction by a State official that violates a constitutional right. Now, as I look at this case the prisoner, if he wins, is not going to get out, and he is complaining about the State violating a constitutional right by refusing to give him DNA.            It seems to me that second question is the question that's the heart of the case: Does the State have a constitutional obligation to give him the DNA? So I would appreciate your telling me why it doesn't.             Is there any reason to think that if, in fact -- sorry.                 I know your time is up, but I really have only one question this morning and I would like to have a chance to ask it, and I am trying to clear away some undergrowth.              And the undergrowth first I have cleared away in my mind is this Heck question. The second is the Alaska court decision.                    And my impression is that Alaska refused the test because, among other things, they couldn't say -- they said the conviction rested primarily on eyewitness testimony, and they have a bunch of reasons.              But the Ninth Circuit, as a matter of fact, tried to blow apart those reasons. Okay? Suppose I agree with the Ninth Circuit. Then my question is this:           Does the Constitution of the United States require you to give this evidence to the defendant?    And one of the relevant points in my mind is I see it would be of significant advantage to the defendant.    Even if he's guilty, he can be proved to -- whatever.    It is an advantage to him.                   Okay? Now, why don't you want to give it to him?              No.     The procedure has the tests in it that the Alaska court -- didn't the Alaska Supreme Court say, we will not give you DNA evidence unless you can demonstrate:              One, that the conviction rested primarily on eyewitness ID evidence; two, that there was a demonstrable doubt concerning his ID as the perpetrator; and, three, that scientific testing would likely would be conclusive.              Wasn't that their test?              And then -- are different -- then they'd give it to him?                In other words, all he has to do is file a new piece of paper tomorrow, and he gets the DNA?                Okay.              And is it true that all he has to do is file a piece of paper in the court that says:   Whatever I said before, I did it under pressure; I am innocent.   And if he says those words, "I am innocent," then he will get this DNA?             Why can't you do this? Look at the consensus of the statutes in the States and the Federal Government and say there's a range of appreciation here, and there is a right but it catches only the outliers?      And so, the worst that would happen is that the outlying States would have to bring themselves into conformity with the outer reaches of whatever the set of statutes is now in all the other States.                 I'm not saying every instance in which there are outliers is unconstitutional.     I'm just saying in this instance for other reasons it might be unconstitutional; namely, you have a good way of proving guilty or innocence, and if that's so, the practical problem is not great.              You solve the practical problem in the way I just mentioned.                 So the constitutional right is bring yourself within any one of them, unless that any one of them is a real outlier, which you can make as an argument that you will never win?              We would like to know what you do --              Okay.       This is where I -- look. He files a new piece of paper.                Now, if you're going to oppose that, on the ground that it wasn't procedurally correct, one; on the ground, two, he didn't ask for this DNA at trial, though he might have met with the charge, what was at issue at trial is something very different; three, that he wasn't guilty -- you know, too much evidence against him, met with the claim, there wasn't much evidence against him -- okay, we have the case in front of us; we'll decide it. But if you're prepared to concede "I'm not going to raise those things," then their client has what he wants -- the DNA.        So which is it?              I'm going to just repeat it.     He -- His client follows your procedure.               "Please give me DNA." Now will you give it to him?                Or are you going to meet him with the same defenses that you raise here?              Wrong procedure.     You ask -- you could have gotten it at trial, which he says isn't true, and there was too much evidence, which he says isn't true.    Okay?       So what are we going to have, Mr. Rosenstein?              If the only defense is procedure --
08-604 +++$+++              It's the same argument -- it's the same argument, as if you had an APA case, and the words in the APA are "arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion," so somebody who has an unfair procedure says it violates those words.             And I don't really see that it's any different, except we normally go to those words before we would decide a due process question.                 It's the similar kind of question.          Why wouldn't we do the same thing here?                Can you -- could you go back for a minute?     I mean, this reads as if it's very complicated, but for me, I read the AFL-CIO brief and that's what I am thinking of and it seems this is not such a hard case.     Basically, there is a statute filled with words of procedure, and it isn't too difficult to interpret that statute as meaning that the board should have fair procedure, not unfair procedure. Now, if you are willing to make that giant step, the remaining issue in the case is whether the procedure here was fair or unfair.                  And the Seventh Circuit is filled with pages of opinion that explains why it was unfair.       And the reason basically it was unfair is because no one in his right mind previous to this case would have thought that you should fill up your brief with a lot of facts that nobody's going to contest.    And after this case, the board said:                  By the way, you have to put in a whole lot of jurisdictional facts even if nobody is going to contest them, and since you didn't do it, you are out, and we won't even give you a chance to do it now. Okay?     So I read that.               I thought, is there something wrong with that?              And then I thought I'd ask you, because you would know. (Laughter.)            It must be what they think of as an interpretation of the rule and the statute that they already had promulgated.             The rule and the statutes say, the rule says you have to include all known relevant argumentative facts.             So if the circular says we mean it, we mean the facts that people are having an argument about. And then the statute says, a full statement of the facts bearing upon the dispute.                  And the circular and then this document say we mean a full statement of facts that somebody might think have something to do with an argument that people are having. And, so, only after this case did the board say, oh, no, you have to include some disputes that nobody is disputing, some facts that nobody has ever disputed or seems to. Now, what's -- what's the response to that?             -- and you are going to say, that's right, that's the correct statement of what happened?
08-6261 +++$+++ 
08-645 +++$+++            If that's so, imagine a well-educated American woman marries a man from a foreign country X.       They have a divorce.            The judge says, the man is completely at fault here, a real rotter.    The woman is 100 percent entitled to every possible bit of custody, and the man can see the child twice a year on Christmas Day at 4:00 in the morning. That's it. Now, there's a law like Chile's that says you can't take the child out of the country without the permission of the father too, this person who gets to see the child twice a year.                 And you re saying that that's custody.     It s custody, and -- and what is the woman supposed to do? She can't get a decent job worthy of her education.     The -- the -- all the courts said that she's entitled to the child.                 She has to choose between her life and her child.                 And -- and is that what this -- this convention is aimed at?           Now -- now, of course, what I'm asking you with my example --           Is why interpret it that way, where all that you have is a rule of law that applies to everybody, even in the case I've tried to imagine, where to say it's a right of custody would ruin the life of the woman, would give the husband something which he should -- certainly shouldn't have in any moral term, it would seem, and she comes back to the United States and is forced to give her child back to whatever this country is.              I have called it X. Now, why give that kind of interpretation to this statute, which seems to have a purpose that s looking after women and children?           Well, that's your conclusion.    I'm just trying to get -- to see if there is any humane purpose underlying the interpretation that you have advocated, and certainly there are two interpretations here.      Your opponents will soon present us with a different one.           That isn t my question.           I'm trying to get at what the humane purpose would be, given your interpretation of the law in this kind of situation?           What s the law -- what is the law if a mother and a child -- sorry.              What s the law if a couple living in a foreign country has a decree of the court, and the decree of the court grants certain visiting rights to the father, and the father, violating those rights, takes the child to a different country.    Can the mother get it back?           What s the normal law where you have a couple -- they re supposed to leave the child in the country, but it doesn't say that. There s no ne exeat thing.          They ve just agreed to certain visiting rights.           And in violation of those rights, the father, say, takes the child to another country in violation of the divorce decree of the first country.           No, you are not understanding my question.           My question is, outside this convention --           If -- forget the convention.   Suppose there s just a divorce decree.           And suppose a parent, violating the decree, takes the child to another country in violation of an ordinary divorce decree. Does the injured parent have a way of getting the child back?           I'm sure there isn't, but under the law --           You would go and take the court's order to a court in the United States and try to enforce it?           And the American court would be under obligation, I guess, to enforce it?           Well, all right.        So our question here is which of the two mechanisms should we use?           I know you think that, but I'm still worried about my mother in the case that -- that you gave me.           I ve read through that, and I ll tell you that, on the basis of my reading through all that stuff, my mind is in equipoise.                 I find some one way, some the other. I think maybe each side does a little overstating here, but -- but I -- I am in equipoise, having looked at that quickly.            So I know -- I know the stuff, you can -- but that's why I am trying to get to the underlying humane idea that s supposed to underlie that, and see if it applies here.         What they seem to be thinking of -- this is -- maybe you can get at what is bothering me.     I m perhaps not articulating it very well.    But the -- where there's any kind of a custody right, I normally think there was a human being called a family law judge who has a very tough job, and he has looked at the situation of these two people here and the child.     And he said, at least:              Smith and Mrs. Smith, you are each going to have a little bit, at least. Now, but in a situation where he says to Mr. Smith, nothing, I want to give you nothing -- he thinks this is Frankenstein's monster; he does not want to give him a single thing -- that, on your interpretation of this statute, that doesn't matter. Just because Chile has a general law that says you can't take anybody out of the country without permission, just because of that, even Frankenstein's monster is considered to have custody for the purposes of this, though the human being who looked at this, called the family law judge, said:                 Don't let him near that child.     All right? Now, that's -- don't pick up on my errors in that I know I haven't stated it quite right, but look at what I'm driving at.      And that's what's bothering me.        I know there are ways out, but why should we include custody to be a situation where the human being who looked at this couple thought that that individual, the husband, should have nothing but visit him occasionally on Christmas?       Why should we interpret the word "custody" in this treaty to include even that situation, which turns the treaty into a general  return the child  no matter what?        Well, could we interpret the words "great psychological harm" to include, for example, a situation where an educated woman with an advanced degree is unable to get work in the country where her child lives and has to live under conditions that are -- that are really -- we would say are fairly primitive because of her inability to find an appropriate employment?     Can you include that under great psychological harm, so that the child wouldn't have to go back?        Well, has there ever been -- would you advocate that kind of very broad standard of great psychological -- and what would be your position, or what's the government's position on that?        Can we read that exception there to say -- "grave injury" and so forth -- can we read it as in essence saying, look, do what's best for the child?
08-651 +++$+++ 
08-660 +++$+++               Why isn't it also a party under all these other rules?              Under all of the rules of discovery?
08-661 +++$+++            All right.       So I thought -- I thought -- as I read your complaint, almost every word of it had to do with pro -- per se violations. So I forget those here, right?           You forget -- just yes or no.   I forget it.     Okay.           Now, I've suddenly heard you talk -- the only thing left I could see was where you say, by their agreement to grant an exclusive license to Reebok, they unreasonably restrained trade in the markets.      That's what I'm supposed to focus on?           What other paragraph do you want me to focus on?           No, I'm interested in the complaint at the moment.        Yes.     Okay.   So I'm looking at the complaint.        You want the Red Sox to compete in selling T-shirts with the Yankees; is that right?        I mean, I don't know where you re going to get your expert from that is going to say there is competition --        But you re going to go back and prove that actually there is competition between those --        Is that what this case is about?        All right.       You think -- I guess you have a right to that.          I'm not -- you have a right, but that's what you re going to have to try --        Yes.        Yes.        But I'm trying to look -- what I'm trying to get in my mind is what specific restraint you are focusing on. You listed three or four, and one of them is you want, in effect -- I'm joking about it, but it's true -- you are arguing that the Yankees should compete with the Red Sox in selling shirts. Another thing you are complaining about, which is the one I understand less, is that these teams got together and they agreed that they would just have one person sell all this stuff together. And what you think is that they individually should have decided whether to choose that one person, or maybe to choose two people, or three.        Is that right?        No.          I find --          I find it easier --          -- to think about the case if I know what's going on.           And I'm not certain this is irrelevant, but given Justice Scalia's persuasive remark, I will withdraw my question. (Laughter.)
08-67 +++$+++              It's an obvious question, I guess.   I would just like to hear your answer directly. Case 1, count 1, selling drugs; count 2, using the telephone to sell the drugs.            All right?         The jury acquits of the first, convicts of the second.                   Logically impossible, but permitted under the law, right?             Okay.       Case 2 --             Okay.       Absolutely illogical.    Case 2, there is no count 1.                Case 2, telephone count, hung jury; we retry it.                  Permitted, right?             All that happened was that they hung.             Okay.       Case 2, hung jury, telephone count; we retry it.              All right.      So now why is it when we put them together and, case 3, count 1, substantive drugs, acquitted; count 2, telephone, hung jury.    Well, in case 2 we could get a retrial of the telephone count.    Why can't we get a retrial of the telephone count now?               All that happened is they are retrying it just as they did in case 2.                    Why does the presence of count 1 there mean that they can't retry it?               I -- I'm going too fast because you didn't take the cases in.                    Do you want me to repeat them?   Maybe it's too complicated. I'm just saying case 1, count 1, the substantive count, conviction.               On count 2, telephone count, acquittal.    Everybody agrees that's permissible. Case 2 is only the telephone.              That's all they indicted him for.   And if they have a hung jury, you can, can't you, retry him?               So, now, when we have case 3, which is the same as case 1 except that, instead of convicting him, they had a hung jury, why can't you retry him, just as you could in case 2?               Oh, everybody agrees it resolves nothing, and that's why you could retry him in -- that's why you could retry him in case 2, because it resolves nothing.    So if you could retry him in case 2, why can't you retry him in case 3?                  What does the presence of this other substantive count have to do with it.   Since it never would have blocked the conviction on count 2, why does it stop you from retrying count 2? It would never have blocked the conviction of count 2.    Why does it stop you from retrying it? Do you see -- do you see my --             That's the logical point I thought the other side was making, and maybe they're not because it seems to be striking you as surprising or maybe I'm not making it in a clear way.                  But what I wanted was a clear answer to it.
08-674 +++$+++            It isn't in the case.           This is a case in which, as I think most cases where they approve contracts, what they're finding is that the contract rate in this circumstance, or here the settlement rate in this circumstance, is a just and reasonable rate, because. All right?   So what are we supposed to do?             I mean, are you going to say he's wrong, the lower court's wrong, because they got the whole thing mixed up.              I mean  - could we say that?           But then if we were to do that --          But you would -- would you agree with my assumptions there?          That what this case is about -- and it's a fortiori from the ordinary contract case -- is that sometimes an agency, because of particular economic circumstances, concludes that a particular rate-setting system is a just and reasonable system, and once that's in place, then as part of that system is the rule you can only challenge it when it violates the public interest, for example. Now, you can go and attack the whole business on the ground the whole business is an abuse of discretion or it departs from the statute.        But if the whole business is okay, that's the end of it.          Now, have I just said the correct law in your view or not?          Sorry?          But I'm not interested in if you have a back-up or not.             I'm interested in, is it correct or not?             How can we?       I mean, that's a -- why not answer a case -- a question about employment discrimination law?            Where -- where in this FERC thing does this say that these are contracts of a kind that Mobile-Sierra was about?                 I mean, I don't even know if Mobile-Sierra -- whether you could -- a third party could attack such a contract under public   under a just and reasonable standard, unless I knew first what the Commission thought about it in this context, because then the Commission's question would be:                Is that a reasonable view?     So what am I supposed to do here?             We would have to take it on the assumption -- wait, I don't want -- you have 5 minutes left that you're reserving?          What's the assumption?           The assumption is the court of appeals thinks that the contract between -- among the generating -- the generators, that that is a Mobile-Sierra contract.                  So we're supposed to say, if that were a Mobile-Sierra contract, which it isn't, then we should decide whether a third party could attack it, about which the Commission has said nothing.            Is that right?          The transition rates?          But the reasonableness depends upon the other.      The validity depends upon the other.   It's all part of a package.          That's all true, but I would want to know what the Commission thought about that one, too.
08-678 +++$+++             Why do you think that your -- that this privilege -- or is it -- more important than any other privilege?                     I mean, Justice Scalia's question and your answer convinced me that you can protect this the same as you can any other trade secret -- any trade secret. Of course, you do disclose it to the opposing party, but that is also true of any breach of any privilege, so husband-wife, priest-penitent, psychiatrist and patient.          I take all of those are privileged.    Do we allow collateral appeals there?              Well, if we don't allow collateral appeals with the husband and wife, with the priest and -- and someone in -- you know, confession or something, I don't -- with a priest, or with a psychiatrist who is dealing with a patient, why would we allow collateral appeal here?              But then if we grant your collateral appeal, don't we have to, perhaps, equally grant it in every situation, where a judge arguably makes an erroneous ruling on a question of privilege?              It's the lawyer.             So it's -- in your opinion, it's more important to protect the lawyers, who talk to clients, from erroneous rulings, than protect the priest or protect the wife or husband or protect the psychiatrist who is dealing with a patient? Now, that's hard for me to see why.                I mean, I think lawyers are very important, but it's a little hard to see why they are more important than these other people.            So -- so, I think any system of -- that denies you the interlocutory appeal, will, in fact, work some injustice.                     I have no doubt about that.    Any system that allows too many interlocutory appeals wrecks the judicial system through delay. Now, I think on that kind of question which is here, maybe there is some information that you come across with the ABA, for example, that has 300,000 -- maybe 600 -- you know, hundreds of thousands of members. There might be instances in the circuits where appeal was denied, where the lawyers would say, my goodness, appeal was denied, I want to tell you the hardship that that worked. Has anyone gone around and tried to find if there are such instances, as there must be, how serious it was?     How harmful, how often do we have any empirical information on that question?             Is it wrong for me to expect that if this would work, a lot of instances of serious hardship not allowing the appeal, some lawyers in their meetings would be upset and they would raise a few examples?    So doesn't the fact that you have been unable to find any tend to count against you?
08-680 +++$+++              Now, I know that you're going to go into the question of how we shape a rule, and I would like you, and perhaps on rebuttal your other counsel, to comment on the following:                    I don't see -- as Justice Kennedy had a problem, so do I have a problem with anything that just says break in custody, and taking time seems fairly arbitrary. Suppose you -- could you try to shape a rule on the civil situation, the codes of ethics, where you are not supposed to talk to a client who is represented by a lawyer?   That's where my mind is going.                 And the best I could do at the moment is you would say:                  When, due to a breach in custody and the passage of time, the questioner did not and would not reasonably believe that the suspect was looking for or was represented by counsel? What I've tried to do is take the purpose of the civil rule, the ordinary ethical rule, and then use it to shape a standard.       So I would appreciate any comments on that thought.              Quite a lot of what I read was about the problems of counsel.                Counsel has nothing to do with this, nothing at all?              If -- are we interested in counsel or not?   If we are interested in whether he's represented by counsel, and Miranda covers both, then I would repeat my question.              If we are not interested in representation by counsel, then I would withdraw my question and you don't have to answer it.            My thought is, can you use the rule for lawyers, which has worked, to help shape a rule that would work here?
08-681 +++$+++               1225?              Was I right or wrong?   -- you didn't mention it. If I am right, why didn't you mention it?
08-6925 +++$+++               But what -- what -- before we can even get into this, I think we have to decide if those words "striking or touching" describe one crime or two.   And what we said in Chambers is that the nature of the behavior that likely underlies a statutory phrase matters in this respect.        If you think of the seven different things covered by one statute in James or Chambers, two of them, failing to return from a furlough and failing to return from work in day release, seem to me quite possibly to describe one thing, not two. Now, how do we know that striking or touching describes two things?             I couldn't find any instance, and we had the library looking.              I couldn't find any instance in Florida where those two things have ever been charged separately.            And they looked at hundreds. So -- so why do we think it's two crimes, rather than just one called "striking or touching"?               It does, too, in Chambers. It's "not returning from furlough or not returning from work release."     You know, and I'd -- I would say the behavior is the same.        It's not like burglary of a dwelling versus burglary of a boat.                      Those are two separate things.               Here, why do you think they are two separate things?               Okay.      If they are separate things, what is the evidence?              There is a legal question.    You say the touching.               Spitting, is that enough to rise under the -- to fall within the Federal statute?    Suppose I agree with you on that; the answer's no. How do I know whether touching as applied in Florida as a separate matter in the mine run of cases, involves spitting or involves something that causes far more serious harm?     How do I know?              Well, there -- most -- this statute actually, we looked into it and it seems to be used, particularly the touching part, also to cover unwelcome physical, sexual advances.                   And it's not hard to consider such matters to have involved force of exactly the kind that the Federal statute is aimed at. And there was no striking, but there was in fact use of harmful force, touching.        That was serious. Now, how do we know which is more normally the case when this statute is used in its touching respect?             I would say that's certainly wrong under our cases.               I mean, I would have thought that the reason that burglary, for example, is a violent crime is not because in every instance there is a risk of physical harm, because in the mine run of instances there is a risk of physical harm, and I thought we said that in at least three cases.             I know, but an element -- you mean we should interpret "element" in the first part of this in a radically different way than we have interrupted equivalent words in the second part, and we should say that burglary -- in other words, assault or -- or -- in other words, unless in every case of prosecution there is going to be force actually applied or something like that, that it doesn't fall within one? I'm surprised at it.     I mean, I guess it's possible. What would be the argument for doing that, which would be totally different than we have handled the other one?             So -- so what about an assault?    I guess, using a law school hypothetical, I mean, a statute for assault -- I guess you could assault somebody by threatening to throw a marshmallow at them.             Okay.       Now, assault is out of the statute.             No, no.          But I mean, on your definition, as you and Justice Scalia were suggesting, because it is conceivable that you could assault somebody by threatening to throw a marshmallow, that means assault is no longer a crime of violence, and that can't be right.            Assault is not a crime of violence; it's not a use of force.            What about attempted murder?            But it didn't --              Well, but --            Well, what worries me more than -- than your application to battery is the methodology, because, if it's true that in Section 1, unlike Section 2, a single instance of where you could commit the crime without using force is sufficient to take it out of the statute, then, just looking through this, generally, you would take out assault, probably have to take out kidnapping.             You would probably have to take out domestic violence.            You would have to take out extortion, certainly, explosives laws. I mean, the very -- laws that I would think Congress certainly intended to include in that first definition.            So that's very worrying, and why I don't think it's the right methodology.            Yes, but an element could be an element that is a -- the word is "element," the use or threatened use of physical force.                 Now, an element, say like abduction, could be an element that uses physical force if in the mine run of cases it uses physical force, even though one can sometimes think of an exception.   That's how we have interpreted 2. So if we interpret 1 a different way, we are going to take outside the statute the very things that Congress wanted inside; and, if we interpret it the same way, I think we would get to the right result.              Rape can be convicted without -- rape can be conducted without force.              All right.       So now rape is out.              Well, the element of rape is not force; it's lack of consent.            You do?          You agree that, then -- in other words, Section 2 is not about property crimes that involve force, which is what Congress happened to say nonstop in the legislative history, which I know isn't read by everyone.                    But it seemed to me reading that history, the first part is dealing with those things that aren't property crimes.                    The second part, like arson, extortion, which they had in mind of a certain kind, and whatever, the explosives-related things, were things that they thought didn't -- could be property crimes that also involved harm to people.            Well, you can't say yes to both of us.             They wouldn't have to say that.    They would have to say that it is not a crime like the three that are mentioned, which I can't remember -- it's arson, extortion -- and what's the third?    Using explosives.             Yeah, burglary, arson, extortion -- all right.        You would say it's not like that.    It's DUI; it was not like that.             And I get --
08-724 +++$+++ 
08-728 +++$+++               You are right, (D) has a special time limit built into it -- I mean, (h) or whatever the number is now.             It says not to exclude 30 days.   Okay?              None of the others do.       So I would say right there, Congress doesn't want the judge to have it for more than 30 days.                  Congress doesn't say a word in any of the others that says anything about preparation time.              No, I know.       But there is not an indication about preparation time.                  Their argument is a literal argument under the statute.                  Is it from other proceedings?        Yes, we know that because of (D), okay?    Does it result from other proceedings?                   Yes, because, in fact, the preparation time is a direct result of the other proceedings as defined in (D). Therefore, it is an ancillary matter related to other proceedings that was caused by the other proceedings. QED, their argument is literal and there is no policy against it.    That's what they said. Now, as soon as you get to the last (h), you would find a big policy against it.                     Called not exceeding 30 days.    Now, I take it that's roughly their argument.            At least my interpretation of it.               Does six days make a difference to your case?          If they lose six days, do you win?

08-7621 +++$+++           Can you do what you have just done with the category non-homicide cases?          Life without parole?          Under the age of 18 when committed?          One hundred and eleven.      Of those 111, how many are in Florida?          Seventy-seven.      And of the remaining,   how many States are they in?          Six.
08-769 +++$+++                 What if I made --                Well, look what you have done, and this is what is bothering me.                  You take these words, which are a little vague, some of them, "serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value," and you say that's a standard that a judge or prosecutor will apply.     And people have to understand it because they have to know what to do to avoid the risk of being prosecuted. Now, as I have gotten out of these briefs, you then require people to apply that standard, not simply to the crush videos or to the dogfighting, but also to, as Justice Scalia pointed out, bullfighting, sheep hunting, bear hunting, deer hunting, fox hunting, humane slaughter, and for, I think somewhere I found, the stuffing geese for pate de fois gras. All right, so there is a whole long -- quail hunting.    There's a whole long list in here of things that people might want to do.              They won't know if it falls within this exemption.              Nobody in every State wants to forbid these things.              Sometimes they are, sometimes they are not.         They won't know whether or not they can make this particular film, picture, or other. That's the overbreadth argument.                 And I would like to hear your response.              So you want to say "cruelly kill"?              Now, "cruelly kill" is not exactly crystal clear.        And therefore my question is why, given the need for you to save this statute to read so many words that are so general, those contained here that I've read, cruelly kill, cruelly wound as opposed to just wound or kill.        You are doing that in order to prevent chilling people who are engaging in activities that aren't intended to be covered by this statute. Why not do a simpler thing?                  Rather than let the public guess as to what these words mean, ask Congress to write a statute that actually aims at those frightful things that it was trying to prohibit.                   Now, that can be done.     I don't know why they couldn't do it.              I'm just saying why -- why can't you here write a statute that does not force the courts into the work of interpreting these very vague words to prevent the statute from being held unconstitutional?
08-810 +++$+++            Well, the SG says that isn't trust law.     The SG says that trust law -- when you make a mistake and you send it back, that the district judge has a choice here, which would make sense.     The district judge, if he thinks he s going to get something out of the trust -- the administrator, listens to him. I mean, it sounds like common sense would be:     Listen to the administrator, but you don't have to do it.           Because it's very complicated.     He may understand it.           So, is she wrong?   You re saying if I look at those cases, I ll find --           It's not -- it's not a standard of review.     It's -- he's trying to figure out what the word "duplicative" means, okay?                And the -- and the administrator did his best.                He says it means what it meant before, which is, like, 14 pages of who-could-understand-it.        Okay.           And then it turns out that that isn't what it means, and the district judge says: That's affirmed.   So now he says:            Give me another shot. If it were me, I d listen, but if I thought this isn't really that great, I would try to figure out something else.     And then if I were a court of appeals judge, I d say it's up to the district court.           Now, luckily, the SG says that is the law. (Laughter.)           Yes.           Says it isn't the law.           What about just that?            He came back, the administrator, I think, the second time, with something that very closely resembled the first time.           And what about that for a reason thinking he s not in that good of faith? Go ahead.           It's -- it struck me if -- it's hard.     I don't necessarily follow it at all, but the -- you had this original plan where, basically, you were trying to figure out how much money they took away, and you compared it with what it would have made if you had invested it in certain funds.                So now we have a new word, which is called "duplicative"; you can't be duplicative, something like that. And then the Second Circuit says that new word called  duplicative  for new plans doesn't really pick up this old phantom system; at least, it doesn't give notice. Now he sends it back, and the poor district judge, since he thought that was perfectly sensible to say it did pick that up, says:            Well, they told me it didn't, so I ll ask the administrator what do you think we do now?    The administrator says:            I have a great idea; the plain vanilla system.              The plain vanilla system happens to be very much like the old system, except in following your own funds, you re not doing it; you re following the -- the insurance industry's funds.           So, I mean, that s -- it's what they ll pay for an annuity.           And that's called -- that's called their funds.     That's called what they think they ll earn.           Right.           Right.           Yes.     Correct, and the question is:     What is attributable to?          And they struck down your phantom system for doing it, and then the administrator comes back with a new system, which new system is going to take the judgment of the insurance companies about what was accrued.           All right, fine. And then what he's thinking is that's awfully similar.     We just substituted different people here --           It's similar in a sense, and it's different in a sense.           But the -- the more you hypothetically grow it, the less chance they ll get the floor.           And so they d like it to get the floor, and so they d like it to be --           Is that right?           That's true.           Up until this time?
08-861 +++$+++            Well, they don't have to -- they can't issue a subpoena without the board's approval, I take it -- the commission's approval.           What?           Or what?           And the commission can't change the sanctions?           And it can't -- it can't pass a rule saying, we don't want you to do that?           So as far as -- if the company was ever certain it was right and that the Accounting Board was out of control, completely wrong, the company would just say:         I'm not complying --           -- fine, do what you want.           And then at that moment, the group that would decide whether they were right or the board was right would be the commission; is that right?           It says you don t -- you can get it even without a subpoena?           Where does it say that?    Or I'll take your word for it.         I ll look it up.            I don't want to delay you, so forget it.    I ll look it up later.          But I've got one thing on my list.   I'm looking to what they control, can't control -- the commission.         And so far I've written that in your view the commission can investigate people without subpoenas, and the commission can do nothing about it, okay?     That's one.          Now, what's two?          Okay.        So we only have one on our list.          Okay.          I'm not saying it's good or bad.     I just want to be sure I have a complete list.           And if you have a statute that says each Department -- Commerce, Justice -- the Attorney General of the United States or the secretary shall appoint an inspector general who will in fact inspect and find ethics violations and that office -- he cannot be removed from that office without cause.              In your view, that's all -- and it would be unconstitutional.           Yes.     Well, why?   What's the difference?             So you are saying that the -- the chairman of the SEC does not under the Constitution have the authority or the SEC does not have the authority to appoint individuals who cannot be removed without cause?             Or -- or you might be saying they do not have the authority to appoint inferior officers of the United States.            I don't know why they wouldn't have that authority if the Secretary of the Interior has that authority.             What's an independent agency?             Well, what is an independent agency?             But why isn't -- so why aren't they subject to the President's plenary control?             The SEC.     What -- what restrictions?   Because, interestingly enough, my law clerks have been unable to find any statutory provision that says that the President of the United States can remove an SEC commissioner only for cause.             It's silent.             But that was not what I have asked.          I know. I'm not interested in that.     I'm interested in an answer to my question.          And the answer to my -- my question was --          -- is there anything in the law, as far as you know, any statute, that says that the President cannot remove a commissioner or the chairman of the SEC but for cause?          The answer is there is something?          Where -- where is that? Would you refer me to that citation?               Because we couldn't find it.             I don't agree with that, but I mean, you do agree.      I thought an independent agency is a function of a number of different things: where it is on the chart, what people's customs have grown up to, expectations about it -             -- what the President might expect he can do or not.        But all those things are not what I'd call hard law.             Well but if it's not hard law, then I wonder.             I mean, that's why I asked the question.   It's not what I have the answer to.             Why?     In Humphrey's Executor there was no provision that said --          There was a provision, which we know, that said the President cannot remove an FTC commissioner but for cause.           Have I been wrong on that all those years?          It would render the board unconstitutional?          If an executive appointee who is a superior officer of the United States appoints an inferior officer, which inferior officer can be removed only for cause -- I mean, my goodness -- I can -- there are lots of shapes and sizes.             I can't imagine what would be unconstitutional about that.            What?             Does the chairman serve as a chairman for a fixed term?          No?    Okay.          So, therefore, what you had said before would not apply to the chairman, that is to say:     The President can remove him at will --          There is no statute to the contrary; he does not serve for a fixed term, and so you cannot imply that.     Since the chairman cannot --          -- can remove him at will -- you do not have what you would call the gearing into play, this somewhat mechanical jurisprudence, of what's an independent agency.          So you are saying that the chairman, not the commissioner, is the person who does the appointing?          Okay.
08-876 +++$+++ 
08-88 +++$+++                -- with that particular period.    The trouble that I have with that particular period is August 1, 2003, to June 14, 2004, isn't that right?    That is Donaldson -- or that's Moore?               All right.      Donaldson was the first one?                Go ahead. (Laughter.)               Well, there -- as I understand it, that that first year the Vermont Supreme Court agrees with you.               They said, we're not counting any of that against you. Now we go into the second year, and the second year had to do with Mr. Donaldson, a lot of it. And it turns out that Mr. Donaldson actually had left the office within a few days of his having been appointed to do this and then he never did anything.                So the Supreme Court of Vermont says, as far as Mr. Donaldson is concerned, we do hold that against the State for the reason that it is the equivalent of not giving him anybody.     The guy they gave him wasn't even a public defender, he never did a thing.                      All right. Now we go to the third group.                    The third group, the State agreed they should be charged.                      That's Mr. Sleigh.    The third one they agreed with it.                    They said lightly, but they agreed with it. And as to the final group, Mrs. Moore, well, it looks like from the record as if the reason that was held against the State had nothing to do with her performance.    It had to do with the fact that the State didn't give certain records to her, which everybody would agree, if it's true, should be chargeable to the prosecution, which is the State. So we have four periods.                    In one of them you won; in the second one he had no lawyer at all, according to the court; in the third one you agree it should be chargeable to you; and in the fourth one it has to do possibly with prosecution errors, not defense errors. Now, what are we supposed to decide?                    Are we supposed to decide whether my statement is, in fact, a correct statement?      If so, why isn't it?                  I guess we have to read the record.           But what else is there to decide?               And you won that.              Is that point in the case? Where -- where is that in this case?                      I don't know who -- I didn't see anywhere where the Vermont Supreme Court said anything, said that, except in the instance where you agreed with them. Where is it in their -- where is it -- who are they are referring to when they said that?                     Is that Donaldson?     Because I thought the claim with Donaldson was it -- it was not his attribution, nothing he did was attributed.     Rather, it was the State's failure to appoint anyone, because to appoint Donaldson was to appoint no one since he had left the office and since he did nothing. Now, is that what we're supposed to decide: When a State appoints a person who has already left the office and does nothing, under those circumstances is it correct to attribute to the State their failure to appoint anybody?
08-905 +++$+++           But the -- I take it the point of general principle, as opposed to this case, is I take it you will concede the following:         Let's imagine on January 1 some investors look out and there are not only storm clouds, thunder, whatever you want, lots to put them on notice.     So then the statute begins to run.   But it could be the case that once they start to investigate, there is a key element, say scienter, the only evidence for which would take them an extra six months to find, because it's in the hands of a person who is in jail in Burma.      All right? (Laughter.) So, you are prepared to say in that situation the statute does not begin to run on January 1; it begins to run on July 1, if they really look into it.   But if they don't really look into it, then it s January 1.     That's I think the basic difference, as I gather, between the sides, or one major difference in this case.             All right.       Now, if that's correct, why?     That is to say, it seems to me that, in treating these differently, you have proposed a real morass for courts to get into. Did they really investigate on January 1? Was it an inadequate investigation?                Was it a thorough investigation?     Along with the difficulty of drawing a distinction between why it should be that that difference should exist, why not just apply the same rule to the investors whether they really do investigate or whether they don't and in both cases the statute begins to run on July 1, not January 1?          Then he would have to file a complaint possibly before he has enough evidence to even bring a case.     That is, suppose my guy in Burma is going to be in jail for 3 years; he can't get to him for 3 years.     Now, he's going to have to file his complaint before he could have the evidence that there was scienter.     Now, that doesn't make sense to me.
08-911 +++$+++           So, in fact, if -- if what we have is a motion in the category of grace, except for asylum, saying, of course, the Justice Department makes a decision that can't be reviewed.               But then the department, let's imagine, has a regulation, and it says:   Anyone can ask the department for a rehearing in such a matter, and we'll decide as a matter of grace whether to give you one. Now, you're saying that would be reviewed?          Why wouldn't it be reviewed?          You just said it was.       You said every procedural decision is reviewed, which to me, makes no sense to begin with, because I can't imagine that Congress, while they don't want them to review the substance at all, is perfectly happy to have the courts review every detailed matter of extra time to file a brief, extra time to have an oral argument.          All those matters would be reviewable, I guess, in your view.          Exactly the same is true of the substantive decision.        I mean, that has nothing to do with it. I want to know -- look, this is where I'm going.   I don't think your -- I can't find a reading of this statute that makes sense, except for one which I am trying on, and I'm sure there s a lot wrong with it, that what Congress meant to do here is to take all the procedural decisions, including reopening ones, and treat them the same way that they are treating the substantive decisions.      So that in his case, he wins. Because he gets review of the substance, he should get review of a reopening.      It's the same thing.      And in some other case, they'd lose, because if you don't get review of the substance, you shouldn't get review of the reopening.    Both are the same thing.            They are just filed at different times. So that, to me, is the only reading of this statute that I have yet found that made sense.             But since no one argues for it, I'm sure I must be making some huge mistake.    But that's what you can tell me. (Laughter.)          No, you are on the right side, because he wins.      No, you're on the right side. He wins.    I take that back.        I'm sorry. (Laughter.)          Yes.           Yes.           Oh, but, wait, new things have happened.   He doesn't just want to relitigate it.           New things have happened; that's why he wants it reopened.           No, he's not, but his motion to reopen is -- it's my hypothetical; I want to deal with it; I accept yours.           My hypothetical is, something new came up.     That's why he wants it reopened.           Something new came up. That's why he -- I think, isn't it true, often people want it reopened because something new came up?          Okay.          No, no.          Oh, I'm asking you, what possible sense could it make?          Look, we're -- two issues. One is grace in respect to -- let's call it fraud, and he loses.   Something new comes up, and what does he want?   Grace in respect of fraud in light of this new fact. Now, my question would be:          What possible sense does it make to say the courts cannot review the first, but they could review the second?           Oh, by the way, this reopening is done by regulation, not done by statute. That's where I get to the problem. You are trying to distinguish between whether it's done by regulation or done by statute.                  And I'm trying to distinguish on a very different context. Treat the motion to reopen the same as you treat the initial motion, whether it's done by regulation or whether it's done by statute.
08-9156 +++$+++               Do I have it right, in your opinion, so far?   I'm just interested in the relationship between (d) and (e), and as I read it, just to look at the language, it seems to me, in the (d) case, we're talking about something that was decided on a record in a State court. And you -- you're the lawyer, trying to get the Federal judge to say, that's all wrong.                     You're going to say their facts are wrong, their fact-finding. So you say:    Judge, that was unreasonable, you know, in light of the record.      That's what you do under (d)(2)?            Now, (e) is a different situation.    (E) is a situation where, for some reason or other -- and there are a few -- you are having a new hearing in the Federal court. One reason for having such a hearing could be that there was a factual predicate that couldn't have been discovered and it's very important.                     So you're get into that Federal court hearing.                And now, when you're in the Federal court hearing it turns out that in the earlier State court hearing there was a fact-finding that has something to do with this.                     It may be not so important, but it's over there and you want to get the judge to ignore it. So there you have to show what (d)(2) says. You have the burden of saying that that was an unreasonable fact-finding.           That's what it says.            Those different words make -- seem sensible to me because the proceeding is different, and the way we talk about the proceedings is a little bit different.                But as a practical reality, I guess they come to about the same thing. All right.       Now, forgetting my last comment, have I got the first part right as you understand it?
08-964 +++$+++             Well, if you leave something out, Congress can put it back in, tailoring the protection to what they feel is necessary.             But if it covers everything under the sun, I've never seen a case where Congress would take something out. Now, if we are relying on Congress, I guess the circuit would say, let's go narrow, and we won t have -- you know -- since you referred to Congress, I thought I would bring that up and see what you think.          So that would mean that every -- every businessman -- perhaps not every, but every successful businessman typically has something. His firm wouldn't be successful if he didn't have anything that others didn't have.           He thinks of a new way to organize.   He thinks of a new thing to say on the telephone.   He thinks of something.             That's how he made his money. And your view would be -- and it's new, too, and it's useful, made him a fortune -- anything that helps any businessman succeed is patentable because we reduce it to a number of steps, explain it in general terms, file our application, granted?          Okay.        Well then, if that were so, we go back to the original purpose of the Constitution.   Do you think that the Framers would have wanted to require anyone successful in this great, vast, new continent because he thinks of something new to have had to run to Washington and to force any possible competitor to do a search and then stop the wheels of progress unless they get permission? Is that a plausible view of the patent clause?          It was fabulous.        And I could probably have reduced it to a set of steps, and other teachers could have followed it.                That you are going to say is patentable, too?          Okay.        Fine.   Now, suppose I reject that view, hypothetically, and suppose I were to take the view that this is way too far, that that s not the purpose of the statute.           Suppose for hypothetical's sake I'm still a little nervous about that -- that circuit's decision there.                Have you any suggestion for me?          That's exactly what I -- maybe I can get you to inadvertently help by -- a hypothesis you don't like.          That's why I say it's inadvertent. You said there are two things.        There are actually four things in the patent law which everyone accepts.    There are two that are plus and two that are minus.     And the two that are plus is by giving people a monopoly, you get them to produce more.            As you said, you get them to disclose. The two minuses are they charge a higher price, so people use the product less; and moreover, the act of getting permissions and having to get permission can really slow things down and destroy advance.                So there s a balance. In the 19th century, they made it one way in respect to machines.           Now you're telling us: Make it today in respect to information.                And if you ask me as a person how to make that balance in respect to information, if I am honest, I have to tell you:                I don't know.     And I don't know whether across the board or in this area or that area patent protection will do no harm or more harm than good. So that's the true situation in which I find myself in respect to your argument.                And it's in respect to that, I d say:     All right, so what do I do?          Well, thank you.       I thought that was the issue, not the answer. (Laughter.)
08-969 +++$+++             On cause, why isn't it a causal connection for them to say, look, your clients don't tell them who's bought it.               They're supposed to, but they don't.   And if we got the information, we go write a letter to the people, and half of them would pay.            Yeah.            But why isn't that a direct applicant action, but for foreseeable?            Yeah.       I know, but there is more here.   It is also foreseeable proximate cause.                 I mean, it is absolutely foreseeable, not just but for.            Forget the website.        What if there had been no website?            Is it foreseeable that, when they don't know who owes the money, that the people won't pay, but when they know who owes the money, they can write them a letter, and half pay?            Some pay.        Some don't. They have the numbers there.              They get more than half.             And, if you put people in front of railroad trains and half survive, then it's speculative?             I mean, if you put somebody in front of a railroad train and half survive because they jumped, does that make it a speculative cause?             And you say it's foreseeable that they won't get a lot of money.                   And that's what they're arguing?             Now, what's the answer to that?             The reason is because of what your clients did, so it's but for and foreseeable.             End of case.          Now, we go to the damage section.             I took torts a long time ago.    I thought that was part of it.             No, no.          There can be other things that cut it off.        Proximate cause.              Foreseeable. No kind of an event that would cut the causal chain, like some odd fluke or something.            No policy reason or others for cutting the chain.      I mean, it's Torts 1 in 1962, okay?

08-998 +++$+++  
09-10245 +++$+++        Sorry, I don't understand that.     Don't the guidelines provide for departures?       Well -- and aren't you giving a guideline sentence, if you give your reasons as is required by the Sentencing Commission in 6B1.2 and you say -- the judge says, I think this is a special case and, therefore, I am giving a lower sentence?     Just as he's required to do under the guidelines in order to accept a C type agreement.       Well, how could it not be? Wouldn't the judge have to say it's not tied to the guidelines, because I am varying and I no longer wish to apply the guideline?     If he doesn't say that, isn't he applying the guideline?       Whether he gives the specific robbery 3-point whatever it is, 17 months, or whether he says, I have a special case and I depart under section 5 of the guidelines.     Both of those are guideline sentences, aren't they?       I don't understand why you resist that.     I mean, that's precisely what the guidelines say.     The only ones that aren't guideline sentences are -- are dismissal charges, where it's an agreement to dismiss.     But a type B, type C -- the guidelines themselves say that the judge, here's what you do.     Judge, you look and see if the guidelines sentence is there.     Is it a guideline sentence?     If it is, you can approve it.     If it isn't, you can't. I mean, that's my reading of what it says. So -- so why do you resist that conclusion?       And, of course, the judge now could depart from the guidelines -- I mean, "vary," whatever that word -- technical word, is -- "vary."     He can say, I'm not going to apply the guidelines at all. But if he is going to apply the guidelines, isn't that what they tell him to do?     I've always thought that. You may tell me I'm mistaken.       Well, how could it not be, since the judge has no power if he is to apply the guideline -       -- to accept any agreement other than agreement that corresponds with the guideline?     That's what it says.     It says the court should accept a recommended sentence or a C -- the specific sentence -- only if the court is satisfied either that it is within the applicable guideline range or if it's based on a departure under the guidelines. That seems to me what it says.     Isn't that what it says?       Okay.     Then if that's so, every sentence is -- you're going to say no?       I mean, I thought that was helping you, but if you want to say no, go say no and explain why that is. (Laughter.)       Yes.       How?       Give me an example.       What?       Yes.       Are we supposed to psychoanalyze the judge?     The judge says on his writing, checks the box:     This is a guideline sentence.     It is robbery.     It is precisely within the robbery range.     But I -- I am going to give it the low end of the range because I believe that the -- he has a lovely mother and family and so forth. Okay?     You're saying that isn't based on the guideline.     No?     Okay.     Is that the point?       What he does is he applies the guideline sentence.     He has to do that.     Now, within that range, he has applied the guideline sentence, he got the information.     He says, I am satisfied it applies -- done. Now are we supposed to look further and say what his true reason is?     Is that what you're saying?       You were -- you were just at the very point when we decided Booker, is that right? It was -- your -- your sentencing took place in July and we came out with Booker in -       All right.     So it's quite possible the judge wasn't totally -- but I mean -- I agree; it's much more complicated after Booker.     I don't know how to treat yours.       It's on the cusp.
09-1036 +++$+++ 
09-10876 +++$+++        But it's not just -       It's not just chain of custody.     I think the Chief Justice is trying to get at this problem, or I am:     Lab technician Jones looks at a vial, and it's blue.     She says to Smith, "it's blue." Smith turns a lever on a machine to B. Jason sees the B and goes into court -- you make him go into court; that's our case.     And what I wonder is, is the defendant now entitled to the following instruction:     Jury, because he's in court, he can say that the machine read B, but that proves nothing about the vial, nothing.     All it proves is what someone said in the laboratory to another person, and those two people aren't in court. Now, that's -- you see, that's the problem, I think, of the intermediate step.     I'd either like to be told I'm wrong about that, you don't have to have them, or explain whatever you'd like.
09-1088 +++$+++        Is this right, then? First, for you to win, the first thing we have to say is we're going to look at page 35, and they say, we're looking at the State court record, the State courts were, in effect, unreasonable.     We have to say that was wrong.     We have to look through the evidence and say that was wrong.     Then you're at first base.       And to get home, we now have to look at the new evidence, and there it's some combination of (a) there was nothing to have a hearing about because there's nothing here that lets you have a hearing; or (b) there was something to have a hearing about because this was so new that it was a new claim, and you should have gone to the State court first on that one, but there's no room to do it.     They don't let you do it. So, okay, judge in the Federal court, you have the hearing, and now, when you have the hearing, first see if there was the diligence.     And there wasn't. That gets you home.     That's the whole argument.       Yes, yes.       Well, then why isn't this a part of the thing, if you have a new claim here, go to the State first?
09-11121 +++$+++        But nothing in the majority conflicts with that, that I can see, except the holding. I thought I lost the case, but apparently it's up again, so I don't see why that isn't a perfectly good test. But if you're not going to support it, then I've got no support.       No, no, but I mean what Justice Scalia was really asking is, do you favor something like this test that I read, which is open as to circumstance?     Anything could fit in that blank, as long as both policemen and the -- and the individual know it and it is relevant as to how he understands the circumstance, whether he's likely free to go or not.       Thank you.     Yes, that's right.
09-11311 +++$+++        But looking at it categorically, I've always thought, means you look to see not just what the elements are on paper, but whether the elements as -- as used in reality in the State are applied to cases that do present -- in general, you apply it to cases that do present a serious risk of physical injury.     And you'd think the answer is we don't know because no one's gone and looked.     You could do it through sampling, but no one's gone and looked.     I've just said that's my view of it. The -- the -- so what do we do?     I mean, I can deal with a lot of other States, but Arizona has exactly the same classification of felony when you use a vehicle and when you use a vehicle creating a serious risk of physical harm to others.     It's in the same provision, same statute, same category.     How do we work with that, in your opinion?       Are you following what I'm doing?     You understand the difference between Arizona and 46 other States?       In the other States, they grade it.     But here they don't.       Indiana -- I'm sorry.       Well, I still -- look, what I'm thinking of -- and I need a little explanation -- we look to see in (b), and it says it's a class D felony if a vehicle is used.     That's (A) under (1).     Am I right?       Okay.     Then we look to (B) under (1), and it's also a class D felony -- in other words, the same -- if a vehicle is operated in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury.       So a prosecutor looking at that will say:     Why don't I just charge (A); what's the point of charging (B)? I mean, it makes no difference apparently. It's simpler to prove (A).       I can deal with it more easily then, at least I have -- but what's worrying me now is what we're supposed to do is:     Is the offense an offense that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another?       So we're here trying to decide whether the (A) one does.       And the answer is I don't know, and the reason I don't know is I don't know how that offense language of (A) is applied in Indiana.       My problem is there is arguably not here a gradation. Suppose it only had (A).     If it only had (A), for me -- I'm not saying for you -- this wouldn't be a tough case.     That is to say, I can't imagine a person running away from a police in a car where there isn't a real risk to other people.     He's speeding, you know.     I would think -- I don't see how you get away from the policeman unless you speed, and there are going to be pedestrians.     Who knows?     But I think that was pretty -- at least as bad -- at least as much of a risk as burglary.     So that would be the end of the case.     It would be simple.     At least assume that. Now, then, however, suppose we have a State which says:     But it's a worse thing to run away and create a risk.     In a separate provision.     It's a worse thing.     All right?     Then I'd say, huh, now I'm not so sure.     Why didn't they charge the worse thing?     This must be reserved for cases where it isn't. So here we have a rather weird situation. They're saying it's a different thing but not a worse thing.     So now I say:     Well, why didn't they charge -- Huh?     Now I don't know.     I don't know why they didn't charge the separate special one.     I don't know what the facts are.     I'm puzzled. Now, that's your case.     That's where I needed the enlightenment.     So, what's the enlightenment?
09-11328 +++$+++ 
09-115 +++$+++        Actually, there is.     I mean, it seemed to me when I read this, it sounded a little familiar, and I think whoever wrote it in Arizona copied it out of the Administrative Procedure Act.     I mean, you read the definition of "license" in the Administrative Procedure Act -       -- and this is awfully close.       That's right.     It might have meant something different; Congress might have. But what is, then -- I read the SEIU brief.     I thought that was pretty interesting.     Is that something you adopt as what the Congress did mean?     I mean, what do you think Congress did mean, and what evidence is there -- if it didn't mean the APA definition, what evidence is there for that?
09-11556 +++$+++        I don't understand the answer you gave to Justice Alito.     Maybe I mixed it up. The police stop the car without cause.       So illegal stop.     And you say as a result of the stop they found out all these things in the records, that he had no license, right?       So that shouldn't be introduced into his trial for driving without a license.       All right.     Now the question I had heard put was, suppose after they got this information, they don't arrest him then, but he gets into the car again and starts driving.     You said then they could arrest him?       Is that right?     Why?     Why isn't -- why isn't that just as much the fruit of the poisonous tree?     They found out he doesn't have a license by the record which came to them from an illegal stop.     I just don't understand it.     Did I get you right as to what you said?       So therefore they couldn't arrest him.     So what they do is they -- is that right?       They see -- they see he - they stopped him, they get the records, wrongly.     They see he has no license.     He says:     How did you know? Because we just looked at your license.     That was illegal; good-bye, gets into the car and drives off, and they can do nothing?       Is that right or not?     Is that right?       I -- how could they -- they can impound the car.       Because?       Because?       Well, what -- what is that word, the "bad faith"?     I take it your rule is identical if when they wrongly stop the car, they look up the records, the records say he has no license, and in addition, he's wanted on 17 drug warrants and for 3 triple axe murders.     Again, you can't do anything about it?       What?     Can you?     You cannot do anything about it or you can?       What?     How?       Why?       So if, in fact, a policeman stops a person without cause and learns as a result of that that there are many warrants outstanding against him, he then can arrest the person, and -- but can he introduce those warrants into court as evidence or whatever if it's relevant?       Suppose the way that the policeman stops the person and gets the information illegally is he takes an axe and breaks into the house, the policeman, and thereby -- what I'm showing -- I just think this case has lots of implications, and I'm looking for a rule here that's going to work in a lot of different situations.       Well, you say that if, in fact, he learns that this man from the public records is a triple axe murderer -       -- he can do nothing about it, I said?     And you said no, he can do something about it.     I just wanted to know the distinction.       It happens to be a description of the individual, not a warrant, he gets from the public record which is read off to him when he calls in, a description:     A red tie.     Can he use that and introduce it into evidence? I mean, is this case about -- what's it about, driving?     Or does it have broader implications? I thought that the Court had held that any public record at all is immune.     Is that right?     Immune from the normal fruit of the poisonous tree rule.       Yes, and I was testing that.     I want to know:     Is that, in your opinion, a correct rule in all cases?       I mean, not an incorrect rule, the opposite rule.     No rule.
09-1156 +++$+++        All right.     So -       This is the same kind of question, but suppose I don't really know how drug companies operate.     I suspect, but I don't know, that where you have a serious drug, people are hurt all the time and they blame the drug.     So probably drug companies operate in an environment where they get all kinds of complaints and some are valid, some are not; who knows?     People are frightened.       Okay.     Now, I don't know that.     But you say at the beginning your client says: Look, we get complaints all the time; you know, just put up with it if you buy our stock.     Now, I don't know to what extent that's true.     I don't know how that fits in. I don't know whether their complaint is unusual or not unusual or general. Who is supposed to decide that?     The judge at the complaint stage?     Or the judge after you get some evidence on it?     Or the jury?     And the same is true of scienter, after all, because the scienter, you see - and you have to plead that with particularity.     Okay. What's my -- what's your answer?     What's the -- what's -- I mean, Justice Kagan has an interesting view of this, and could be, that she's putting forward and others might have a different view.     Who is to decide this?       Well, we don't know.     You see, what they're saying is we have one respectable doctor, studier, at -- you know, in Colorado.     He, by the way, has an abstract which isn't in the complaint, which says that they do allege that it's zinc that's the problem, a free zinc ion.     And they say we also have 25 people who were hurt and some burning sensations in people where it didn't rise to that level. You know, I don't know.     I don't know if that's within the range of expectation of drug companies as part of the normal course of business which investors should know about, and I suspect a district judge doesn't know, either.     So how does it work where we in fact just don't know whether this does or not arise above the background noise of a drug company?       But, look -- I mean, Albert Einstein had the theory of relativity without any empirical evidence, okay?     So we could get the greatest doctor in the world, and he has dozens of theories, and the theories are very sound, and all that fits in here is an allegation he now has learned that it's the free zinc ion that counts.       And that could be devastating to a drug even though there isn't one person yet who has been hurt.     So I don't see how we can say -       -- this statistical significance always works or always doesn't work.       They did.     They said - they said the free zinc ion was -- that word on this was told to your client by a person who knows a lot about it, is apparently reputable, and was told to a person who also knows a lot about it.     Huh.     I think they're saying you ought to have been very nervous at that point.     That isn't just a usual background noise, okay? So I'm back to my question, which is -- you can answer the other one too if you like.     But, I mean -- but my question is:     Who is supposed to decide, how?       I know, and we're back at my question -       The question is that are pleaded is -- I think it's assumed that this is above the normal background noise -- they certainly argue that at length -- that there was this free zinc ion conversation, that there are 25 people who were hurt, and there is a lot of burning sensation going on, even though it doesn't rise to the level of people being hurt, and that's supported by some of the zinc sulfate studies in the fish -       -- okay?     Now, they're saying that's above the background noise, and you say, no, it isn't.     Now, who decides and how do we decide? Don't we have to go to a trial?       I know.     I know, but over -       We're not saying -- you're saying if you are a scientist -- now we're back to Justice Scalia's questions and the others.       No, because the sulfate - you see in the abstract, which they didn't put in the complaint, that the problem that they saw arising out of the zinc sulfate studies was the free zinc ion.       I -       All right -       The trouble is, you know, the truth is I don't know -       And so I'm back to my question.
09-1159 +++$+++ 
09-1163 +++$+++        7 and 3 -       Why does that show that?     I mean, why doesn't it show acceptance of Crooker?       I mean, if that -- Crooker was -- was interpreting section 2 -       -- that was the interpretation.     Everyone had followed it, every court. Nobody disagreed.     All your four arguments Judge Edwards went into thoroughly.     Everyone but Judge Wilkey approved it.     And so Congress reads that, and they make it specific in 7, but they say nothing about 2.       How do you know?     What we have is 7(E) in front of us; 7(E) says we want to be sure something like Crooker's interpretation of 2 applies with law enforcement.     It's simply a case -- so they apply it with law enforcement.     Absolutely now it's guaranteed.     Crooker is not guaranteed because it could be overturned.     You never know what will happen. But what in that suggests they don't want Crooker to apply to the Fed for example, or to the Navy, or to -- which is here storing -- it's storing explosives.     Why would -- I mean, I can't get anything one way or the other from the fact they passed 7.       Why should I get one rather than the other?     For every argument you make, I can see an argument the other side -- that they make.       What's your answer to that? It was a question, really. (Laughter.)       Well, why do you want to know?     How wide the corridors are in some Federal buildings, and terrorists could use that to bad purpose, but we want to give it to the firemen because they'll use it for a good purpose.     We want the policemen to know, we want different civic groups sometimes to know, but we want to keep a limitation.     We want it restricted, restricted to minimize the chance it will get into the wrong hands.     I mean, I don't see anything illogical about that.     What's -- what's illogical about that?       Why?       Well, that's a different argument.       I mean, your four arguments seem to me to be the same arguments that Judge Edwards and the D.C. Circuit considered, and they are excellent arguments, and there are arguments on both sides, and then they considered it and came to a conclusion.     But this is a different argument you're making here, and I was addressing that.       I mean, it's only addressed for law enforcement.     It's -- there are many dangerous or -- for example, this isn't law enforcement; this is munitions.     The Navy thinks, rightly or wrongly, I guess you can -- that they don't want these maps circulated because they think it would make it easier to blow up the munitions.     They want the firemen to have them, they want the civil defense workers to have them, but they don't want people who might blow them up to have them.       Now, that's -- that's their reasoning.     Now, that isn't addressed, it seems to me, in 7, because 7 deals with law enforcement.       How is it -- how is it broader?     I -- I looked for the words.     I just missed them, and you can point them out. When I read about the circumvention, what Crooker says is:     "We hold that since the document for which disclosure is sought meets the test of 'predominant internality,' and since its disclosure significantly risks circumvention of federal statutes or regulations," it is exempt. It didn't say anything about circumvention because there is a regulated entity and it is that regulated entity that will circumvent.     It just spoke of circumvention, as far as I saw.     But maybe there's another place where it talks about regulated entity.     Is there?       Oh, that's -- but that - if we're looking at Crooker, I just read the words "would there be circumvention" -       -- and it seemed to me, in this case, the Navy has plans and they use those plans to store munitions safely, and the risk that they worry about is someone will get ahold of the plans and use the positions of those munitions in order to make them unsafe, for example, blowing them up.     So that seemed like a very serious circumvention of what the regulation was there for.       That's correct, and I didn't find anything in Crooker that said -- and I don't know why you'd have such a theory.     I don't know what the point of the theory would be, that you would care whether blowing up took place by somebody who technically was regulated by the Navy or blowing up took place by some other person, whom they're worried about.
09-1205 +++$+++        A totally different party -- if a person, say an intervenor, joins a litigation late, and there have been a lot of procedural rulings, I guess that that intervenor takes the case as he finds it.     Now, he could go to the judge and say: Judge, I want you to reconsider your procedural ruling in light of the fact I'm here. How does the situation I've just sketched differ from this one?     I mean, you have a client who's coming to the litigation late.     He's separate from the litigation, I know, but he could send a representative to the judge and say:     Judge, I want you to reconsider in light of the fact I'm joining.     Now, I know I'm not joining; in fact, I'm bringing a different case. But I'm thinking of the -- of the Chief Justice's hypo, here and I'm -- and I'm trying to apply it.     And is your client analogous to that person who joins litigation late?       Did it ever happen -- did you ever come across an instance before where in a Federal court a judge in the district court says, no, you can't have a certification, no; and then a different plaintiff went to a different Federal court in a different part of the country and asked for a similar certification?     Have you ever found anything like that in precedent, that it's in two Federal courts rather than the State/Federal?       And did they say -- did they say in -- in that case that the second judge is bound as a matter of stare decisis, or is he bound as a matter of collateral estoppel?       So it's the same issue as here?       Do we know that in the record, that the attorneys didn't even know about each other's cases?     Is that borne out?     I mean, is that an issue?
09-1227 +++$+++        What do you say about the one thing -- the strongest point against you, I think, is a single sentence in that TVA case.     It's only one sentence, but it's there in the opinion, and I think what it's saying, Justice Roberts says, well, he already finished, he just finished saying nobody -- Congress hasn't violated some rule against creating a system of regulation in this statute because it isn't regulation. But then he said, but even if it were, even if it were, and if your complaint was that Congress has acted outside its authority, which they might have thought at that time, in creating a system, TVA, that competes with local systems, even if that were so, the appellants, absent the State or their officers, would have no standing in this suit to raise the question. Okay, now, that -- they put quite a lot on to that.     That is what it says.     So are we supposed to say, well, that was an ill-considered dicta?     Or are we supposed to say it was just wrong?     Are we supposed to say the law has changed?     What in your view are we supposed to -- or is different.     What in your view are we supposed to say?       So it comes out of left field, and it's an overall "any, even, if."     So that suggests it's just dicta and doesn't count.       Why didn't it just consider it as outside the Commerce Clause?     I mean, they had a whole lot of law, but what is the distinction between saying, as they said then, "Court, the TVA regulates electricity rates in Memphis and that's beyond the power of Congress to enact"?       In this case, which - because of the Tenth Amendment and a lot of other things.       And this case seems the same, saying it's beyond the power of Congress to enact because of the treaty.       Yes.       How do we know that?     I'm not doubting you; I just want to know.       Yes.
09-1233 +++$+++        The receiver said the best statement that seemed to me to summarize it.     It's in his brief on page 9.     He has about two paragraphs.     And as you read that two paragraphs, it sounds as if overcrowding is a big, big cause of this problem, which is horrendous, which if you think it's accurately described in the mental case in the first page, two paragraphs -- now, if that's a fair description from the record, it's a horrendous problem.       What the receiver says is overcrowding is a big cause of it.     And then he says: think we've discovered you actually can provide care, and certainly our plan and turnaround plan believes we I can provide constitutional levels of care no matter what the population is. So then you look to the care and turnaround plan and it says spend $8 billion building more buildings.     And then the legislature rejected it.     Okay?       Now, there we are.     More time; what's supposed to happen?       Yes, it was 2.31 or something like that.       And did they approve the 2.3 -- is that in place, 2.35?   Did they approve that?       Okay.     So he said -       We need 8, and they approved 2.35.       And is there any evidence here that suggests that 2.35 is sufficient to cure the constitutional violation?       So I take it from your answer the answer is no, there is no evidence.       Well, what he says -- what the receiver says about the 2.35, that it is a significant step farther.     It is certainly better than no construction at all.     However, that is not equivalent to a conclusion that that current compromise will result in sustainable constitutional health care at current population density levels. That's what he said about it.     So -- so we have his views, and I'm back to my question:     What else is supposed to happen?       Which was your question initially.       What would I look at to find this?     It's a big record.     What I did was I -- it refers to on-line evidence, and I went and looked at the pictures, and the pictures are pretty horrendous to me. And I would say page 10 of the religious group's brief, for example, shows you one of them. And what they're saying is, it's -- it's obvious.     Just look at it.     You cannot have mental health facilities that will stop people from killing themselves and you cannot have medical facilities that will stop staph and tubercular infection in conditions like this.     And then you look at them. Now, you've looked at them.     I've looked at them.     And what is the answer to that?     There's nothing in here that -- the special master said $8 billion is the answer.       And they haven't come close.     So how can I -- or you if you were in my position -- what would you say in an opinion that says that these three judges who have 200 pages of findings -- what would you say to -- as an answer to what I just said?       What specifically will happen?     I mean, at the moment, you know, we could go through -- we have all these briefs.     I mean, there are all these experts, all the reports.     Everybody is saying you need to spend the money.     And we have -- if you really want to cure the constitutional violation, we have the legislature rejecting 8 billion but 2, which - 2.35, and so -- and nothing, and a void, and give us more time. I mean, I read the newspaper.     It doesn't seem to me California has been voting a lot of money for new programs.     The -- the -- what is it -- what is it specifically that would happen that would cure this problem were we to say -- I mean, a big human rights problem -- what would we say -- what would happen if we were to say, no, this panel's wrong?     What would happen that would cure the problem?       A constitutional problem which the State itself admits -       -- is constitutional, a State with a governor who has said publicly that there's this tremendous safety and health problem in the prisons.     What -- what would happen?
09-1272 +++$+++        What are the objections to adding in the alternative "or in bad faith"?       Objectively?     I mean, what we're trying to rule out is they -- they hitch -- they get this bright idea, the police:     We'll go knock at every door.     You know.     So what about that, objectively determined bad faith?       My point is a solely unlawfulness test would allow the police to get into the habit of just knocking at every door, but if you say that also it has to survive a bad-faith test, where bad faith is objectively, not subjectively, determined, then you will rule out the possibility of the police hatching -- which I don't know if they would, but hatching such a plan.       Well, there are circuits who have adopted a bad-faith test in the alternative with other things than the word "unlawful."     The Second Circuit uses only the word "unlawful," and I thought we took this case to iron out that discrepancy.     And if we did, I'd like to know your objection to ironing it out by taking the Second Circuit test but adding on an objectively determined bad-faith rule.       Well, the police say I don't want to get a warrant.     It's such a bore.     We have other things to do.     I have a great idea; let's knock at the door, and then as soon as he starts moving around, I know what his going to the -- going into the bathroom means, and we'll hear that, and we'll be able to get in.       Hey, great idea. Okay?     Now suppose that's the record.       No, no.     I mean to add And, in fact, there's probable cause.       In addition, he smelled the marijuana.     I just was trying to stick to the relevant points.       Yes.     All right.     Add that to the hypothetical.       Correct.     That's what I mean, and I don't always spell it out.
09-1273 +++$+++        So what is Santa Clara County supposed do?     They -- they think they're being overcharged.     And in your opinion, they -- the company doesn't, but they do.     So what are they supposed to do if they're right?     How do they get the money?       I'm interested in procedurally what are they supposed to do?       The manufacturer says Okay, you're wrong.     I'm not; I'm undercharging you. Now what happens.       He's busy.       Well, Why can't they -- can they, for example, file a claim with the -- with the Secretary and say we would like the Secretary to order them to give us the money; they're violating this?     They go to an administrative law judge.     Is there an administrative remedy of some kind that would be reviewable in the courts for reasonableness?       Okay.     So why is it reasonable, then, to think that the Secretary would have entered into a contract which is going to benefit them and there's no remedy?       But normally under the law from Marbury v. Madison onward, where there's a wrong, there's a remedy.       And the remedy could be administrative, could be judicial, et cetera.     But you're saying there's none?       But in such cases, there very often is an administrative remedy -       -- and the person always - any individual in the United States can go ask any agency to do anything, and there is even review in instances of a refusal to withhold -- a withholding of action.       Is there here?     You said there was.       Suppose that the State of California says we'd like our counties to be able to enforce this.     Then what happens?       Well, suppose that California -- if California wants to say we could bring this suit like Massachusetts did, you agree they could. And then they say, all right, but we don't have the time; we want the counties to do it.     Couldn't they do that?       Well, what's the difference between -       What's the difference between a State doing it itself through its attorney general and the State saying we'd like the county to do it through its county attorney?       All right.     California comes to you tomorrow and says the attorney general says:     You know, this is a problem.     You don't have time to enforce this.     There should be some enforcement, and we want to enforce it.     And, moreover, we'd like each county affected to enforce it. Do you have the authority?     Is there any reason you wouldn't say go ahead?       I'm trying to analogize it to the Massachusetts one.     You say they can just go ahead and do it, and they say, you know, Santa Clara County is just as big as Rhode Island.     And you say the AG of Rhode Island can bring the suit; am I right?     And so why can't the -- why can't Santa Clara do it?
09-1279 +++$+++ 
09-1298 +++$+++        The two questions I'd have is, first of all -- Justice Sotomayor, sorry; I did not -- I did have her question, because what that suggests is, in this case, it's not unfair to hold your client in this case.     And you just read the two circuit court opinions here, and you think this is a defense coming out of long in the past that doesn't have much substance to it.     That was her question, I think, as I understood it.       In other words, it's not unfair.     But let me give you the other question because, sometime in your argument, I'd like you to get to that. And that is, if we accept as a principle of law what was said in Reynolds, a criminal case or whatever, and apply it to government contracting, where sophisticated contractors are perfectly capable of negotiating their own contract, we are not just throwing a monkey wrench into the gears of government contracting; we're throwing the whole monkey.     That's my second question.       One, that this isn't a case that calls for it; and, two, the threat to government contracting by changing from Reynolds to here is overwhelming.     Now, I'd like your views on both of those.       That's exactly my problem, because when I looked at Reynolds, Reynolds doesn't hold anything in your favor.     It holds the opposite way.     It says to you -- in a criminal case, we said it was unconscionable for the government both to prosecute and not to -- not to tell them a secret, okay?     And it says such a rationale has no application in a civil forum where the government is not the moving party.     It doesn't say anything about where the government is the moving party.       And Exhibit A that it is not unconscionable here consists of the two opinions of the Federal Circuit.     I mean -- now, what do you want me to read to get over that impression?       It didn't limit it.     It said the rationale is unconscionable.     Now, I don't even have to go that far.     I can go to "fundamentally unfair."     All I want to know is what should I read to get over my unfortunate impression, which I got out of the two opinions that I did read, that there was nothing unfair?     Okay? What do you want me to read to get over that impression -       -- which I think you do want me to read something.       Okay.
09-1343 +++$+++        Right.     Can I ask you -       Now, first, the word "distributor" hurts you, so I'm going to take that out, and I imagine a hypothetical -- I know your case differs from that, but I'm going to ask them how it differs, not you, okay? Now, a person walks into a shop in either West Virginia or the country of India where they make pots.     They're very nice pots made, actually, in West Virginia.     And the potter makes several thousand a year, and this individual says:     Mr. Potter, I want to sell your pots; send me a thousand each year.     Where are you going to sell them?     Everywhere.     Great. Okay?     That's it.     Now, suppose that the law were, as it could be perhaps, that it is sufficient for jurisdiction throughout the United States that the distributor or independent buyer said good, I'm selling them everywhere I can.     And two or three end up in New Mexico, but it doesn't matter where they end up. Suppose that was sufficient to find jurisdiction. You've prepared for this case.     I want to know in your opinion, if that were the rule -- that's all that's necessary -- what cases in this Court in your opinion would that conflict with?     I mean, I'm thinking of the facts.     I'm not thinking of statements of law or whatever, but you can bring those in, too.     I want to write those down because I want to read those cases, and you know them better than me.       I don't know what a convenience test is.     Assume I'm very ignorant, which isn't too far from the truth.     I would like you to tell me, are there any cases which we would actually be conflicting with were we to say all that's necessary to assert jurisdiction in every State is that a buyer walks into a shop where the manufacturer of pots makes pots and tells the potter I'm going to sell everywhere I can, and the potter says good, okay.     Now -- and he buys the pots. Now, if that were the rule, can you find a case that that actually conflicts with?       Asahi, okay.

09-1498 +++$+++        Is -- is it right that the Rules Committee then changed it, and it basically said the way the defendant here thinks it should be is that's what it should be?     Isn't that what happened?       Okay -- now -       The Rules Committee said count calendar days.       They changed the rule.       And now you think that the Federal courts are right in saying, judge, when you have a Speedy Trial Act case, look to Rule 45; you think that's right to do?       Okay.     So why shouldn't this defendant whose case was on appeal get the advantage of that?       I know it was under a different rule.     But where -- normally with cases where you have a new rule come in, it does apply to the advantage of the people who were then on appeal.     Is there something special about this, that Federal rules don't, or you just -- too bad, we thought it was a really erroneous thing that they had, we used to have, and we've corrected it, but just -- he's still on appeal, it doesn't apply to him?     Is there some law on that?       I understand.     I understand they followed the rule at the time.       They've changed the rule. His case is still on appeal.     Why shouldn't he get the advantage of the new rule?       It wasn't anybody's fault. Why shouldn't we go back and say do it again, and now, let's -- since his case is still on appeal, it's the same question.     What's the argument against doing that? Why can't we? I'm sure there's some rule out there that says we can't do this, but I want to know what it is because it seems fair.       Any other reason?       I mean, I'm thinking that we normally -- although all this is quite true, what Justice Scalia says, normally we do apply new rules to those who are on appeal at the time.
09-150 +++$+++        What do you mean?     How could it possibly be admissible? First, there has to be a degree of formality, as the Court held in Hammon, sitting in the kitchen; and, second, it has to satisfy State hearsay tests.     So unless it's an exception to the hearsay rule, it is not admissible.       Well, of course, there are exceptions.     There could, in fact, there could be a co-conspirator exception.     There could be a dying declaration exception.     But what we're talking about is whether the Constitution keeps it out, even though State law -- because, say, it's a co-conspirator exception - would permit it in. So the answer is no, it's not the case that whenever you come across a victim of a crime and ask him questions, it's going to be admissible.     It depends. The State hearsay law, the exception, and whether there's a degree of formality, as there was in Hammon.       It would not apply?     There are -- there isn't a Federal hearsay rule?     And there are not exceptions that you have to satisfy?       I thought there were, in my copy of the Federal Rules of Evidence.
09-152 +++$+++        And can you -- maybe this is a good point, but I would like to know what your response is.     I'm not asking you in either a hostile nor friendly way. The -- assume for the moment that the language, I cannot find clear one way or the other.     So I think it's ambiguous.     At that point, what is your response, on that assumption that this brief on the other side from the American Academy of Pediatrics and other physician and public health organizations - what the pediatricians here say is that, if you win, we're turning this over to judges and juries instead of the FDA and other specialized agencies, that the result could well be driving certain vaccines from the market, and basically, a lot of children will die.     And that - that's their claim. And I think that their legal argument there is that wasn't Congress's purpose.     Congress's purpose was the contrary. So leaving the language out of it, I would like you to respond to what I would call that purpose-related, fact-related argument by these particular people.       Well, there is another case on that where we are going to have to go into -- which is, does that mean every bit of it has to be clear? Does it mean the intent has to be clear?     That's a complicated area.     But I will put that aside for the moment.       Right.     I've got -       And that's -- that's why I am asking you:     Is that the best you can find on the other side, namely something I once wrote in a case?     Or are there other -- are there other things? (Laughter.)       Their argument is that the CDC will do it better than juries.     That's what I heard him say.
09-1533 +++$+++        Yes, but she says there's no way -- and she does cite this professor from Yale and so forth, who says if the stuff has the base in it, it can be abused in ways that if it has the salt in it, it can't be abused.     That's all we can look at.       That's her point.     That's her point.     You can respond to that if you want.       She says there is a reason. It's because it contains base, and for many years, it was smoked in Latin America and can be smoked here. That's her reason.     Now, your response is, it's a bad reason?
09-158 +++$+++                 Then -- then you get to - you get to Justice Alito's question, because in fact what we have here is we have piece of paper issued in 1981, and on that piece of paper it says:                  You, Billy Joe Magwood, are guilty and sentenced to death by electrocution.   Then we have another piece of paper which was issued in 1986, and that says:                  You are ordered and adjudged guilty of the offense of aggravated murder and sentenced to death by electrocution.                     So the words are identical.       And one was issued in '81 and one was issued in '86. So you are saying since '86 -- this piece of paper in '86 is a new judgment, you can start all over. So then the question comes up, well, if you can start all over in respect to anything, why can't you start all over in respect to everything?                But you recognize that that would be a mess, because all the things that were never challenged here, like those things related to guilt, they could all come up again, too, even though he has never done it. So what is -- what is -- what is your answer?   Clearly you are going to start saying some things if it wasn't at issue you can bring up, and others you can't; and once you are down that track, how do we know whether these are on one side or the other?               It is something new in respect to the sentence.               It is something new in respect to the sentence.               Ah!      But it is not new in respect to the words.      They are identical.             All that happened -             -- is the sentence was reimposed.   So why not those things? Does your concession on the first part, which I agree is necessary, imply a concession on the second part, that it's not new in respect to what might have been brought up before?               No, I think what you would have to do -- it's a dilemma here.
09-223 +++$+++                 Before you get into that, I have a question that there may be an obvious answer to, but I haven't found it.          My understanding is -- it's a standing question.      My understanding is that they are asking as relief, and the only relief they ask for, is to raise the taxes of a competitor.                       Am I right?                Okay.        If that's correct, I have found no case that -- I haven't looked that hard, but certainly no case in this Court -- that said there is standing for a firm to challenge the taxes of a competitor where the remedy is:                 Raise his taxes.        If there were standing for such a thing, it would -- I'm surprised that there aren't competitors all over the country doing business out of State bringing diversity cases in Federal court, saying:                 My competitor's taxes should increase; it's all very complicated, but the Commissioner didn't properly follow State law. Now, I have found no case, certainly not in this Court, which said:          Where all you want is to raise the tax of a competitor, you have standing.                      So perhaps this is well-settled that you can do it, but I thought I would raise that for both of you at the beginning in case there is something you want to say about it, which might save me a little time looking it all up.             I have no doubt, and the standing rule I think is clear, that if we're saying because I am injured, and they have injury, you can't - you must give me reduction in my tax.                    That's what those cases say.    I have no problem with that.                  Absolutely clear.   You can do it. But where all you want is to raise somebody else's taxes, that I had thought -- and probably wrongly, but I had thought there is a prudential standing rule that says you cannot bring such a lawsuit. And I don't see why you should be able to.                    It seems to me it would be a nightmare if you could, which doesn't surprise. So there we are.           That's the question.            And you will tell me:    No, it's all clear; they can do it. And I would like some citation or something and explain why they should be able to do it.                  But you don't want to, anyway.    It's really for them.             Is there anything -- I see in their complaint, they ask for "such other relief to which plaintiffs are entitled," and therefore the judge, despite what they say, might just say:                 Well what you are entitled to is you are entitled to pay fewer taxes. Is that a plausible thing, in which case it would interfere with the revenue collection of the State.             What is -- what's your - you better give me your accurate assessment, not just agree with me, because I would like to know what you -- I want to know both sides.                But I have no idea -- why I am asking the question is I have no idea or little idea of the underlying State law merits.                       And my suspicion is in about 10 or 15 minutes I will hear that the State law merits are such that it's virtually impossible that they are going to say to us:          Pay fewer taxes.               Rather they will say to our competitors:              Pay more taxes.           So now is your chance to reply to that hypothetical argument just in case they make it. (Laughter.)             Have you found any authority on the following proposition:                      That a plaintiff, an out-of-State company, brings a suit in Federal court, where the normal relief would be to give him a refund.     He says:       I don't want a refund; I just want a declaration; I want to you declare this unconstitutional.       Have you found any case like that?             Wait.        Wait.   Forget comity.     I'm just asking you -- I want to read the right authority.     Can a person, in other words, get around the Tax Injunction Act by pleading his claim and just saying:     I don't want an injunction; all I want is a declaration?     It seems to me it should have come up in history.     So I can have the First Circuit cases to look at.    Anything else?             Well, then why don't they win?     Because their first thing, they say:                  Declaration. They just want a declaration.               Strike their second claim.     All they want is a declaration.
09-291 +++$+++        But why can't -       Why can't they get -- the first question, to go back, is just a confusion in my mind:     Why couldn't she bring this suit?     And she says: I was discriminated against because they did A, B, C, D to him, and the remedy is cure the way in which I was discriminated against.     And to cure that way, you would have to make the man whole in respect to those elements that we're discriminating against her. Do you give him back pay?     Do you restore him?     You do everything you would normally have to do, because otherwise she is suffering the kind of injury, though it was to him, that amounts to discrimination for opposing a practice.     What's wrong with that theory?       Why?     Why?       So what?     She's hurt. Suppose it was a child that they -- what they -- or suppose they robbed -- they robbed the -- the judge's wife in order to get him to do something?     And -- and that's a crime, and suppose there was a civil statute. The judge says:     The way you cure what you did to get me to do something is you make me whole.     And in that instance, it requires making her whole.     What's the Article III problem? Well, anyway -       I don't know that this is crucial, but I'm -- I'm -- I'm just saying -       But that's because the award of money to be paid for somebody else, their absence of money didn't hurt you, but where there -- for example, if you're a trustee, you certainly can sue to get the beneficiary put back.     There are dozens of cases where you can sue to get somebody else paid back money, and -- and why isn't this one of them? But anyway, I'm not -- I don't want to pursue it beyond a quick answer, because there are other things in this case.
09-329 +++$+++        Why "to be sure"?       Of course, you can also read Mead and decide what it says.     Being in the majority, I thought the dissent's characterization was not what it said.     I mean, the dissent -       The dissent can write what it wants to write.     But I don't think that that was what Mead said, but I guess there's disagreement about that. What did you think?       No, no.     But I -- I'm sorry.     You're an informed reader, and I -- I thought Mead definitely did not say that.     That was the dissent's characterization of what it said.       That is one indicator.       But not exclusive.       So in your view, that's staff commentary, the staff thing means -       -- look, if you didn't say -       If you failed to say in your original notice that default is the trigger, then you would have to give another notice?
09-337 +++$+++           This might be tangential, but is there a reason to suggest the Federal Maritime Commission look into this?         Because I read the regs.         I don't understand quite what's going on, because it seems to me they have a rule that is designed to prevent this situation.          Is that true, what I'm suggesting or not?   You know the area better.
09-338 +++$+++              There are thousands and thousands of mistrials every year and hung juries are not all that unusual.        So in this case we have testimony going on for 4 days, 10 hours total.                      And we have jury deliberation of 4-1/2 hours, and we have really very little -- I think you can argue it both ways that the jury was deadlocked.        There are some things for, some against, only a couple. And he doesn't consult with the lawyer, all right.     Now, in these thousands and thousands of cases that must be there over the decades, you probably looked through a few or at least talked to your fellow bar members.     How many have you found where you would say that a mistrial was declared despite facts that are on your side?     In other words, there are going to be millions of cases, not millions but thousands; many of them will support the defense.                Maybe many support you. But I haven't seen any here that say they support you. So how many do?   And what do you want me to read to see that this is not an extreme case that counts as an abuse of the judge's discretion?             How many did you find which will prove to me this is not, this is closer to the norm?               Correct.         That's why I am asking the question.        What they've said is, is it an abuse of discretion?        And they've also said the judge has to be careful.      Okay, so we have like an abuse of discretion scale and this is pretty far over on the abuse of discretion side.            I think anyone would admit. But what cases will show to me that it's on your side, not quite an abuse of discretion?                  Or is this the most extreme case in history?               I know you don't believe it.   All I want you to do is to give me some evidence, like refer me to some other cases or explain to me how you have come to that conclusion, not on the facts of this case, but looking on the scale.             I don't want you to look at this Court.    We don't have a case where we said what was an abuse of discretion.         I want you to tell me -- and I've already said this twice, but I am judging from your answer you found no case supporting it.                  You have found no case in the history of the United States that was more extreme than this -             -- where they said it wasn't an abuse of discretion.               That's what I'm judging from your answer.             There is no note indicating.    There are five, there are notes they sent out, and at 9:30 in the morning they said:                  Judge, we have a concern about our voice levels, disturbing. That's what they said.        Then they asked to see the evidence and they said:         Explain Count 2. Then they said:           Are we allowed to break? And then they said:       What if we can't agree?                 Mistrial, retrial, what?     And at 12:27, the same time, they said: What about lunch? Then he brought them out and he says to the juror:   All right, do you believe it's hopelessly deadlocked?     And the foreperson said:                  The majority of us don't believe that.         And he said:               Don't say what you're going to say.        And then he doesn't have the lawyer there. Okay, that's fairly extreme.                    So that's why I ask the question.             Exactly but I'm drawing some conclusions from your silence.                     You haven't found a case supporting it?              And those are the ones - so as I'm seeing this case, it isn't that complicated. You know, it's pretty clear what the standard is.            The standard is, was the decision of the -- of the State court reasonable in deciding that there was a sound - sound -- the words come from nine wheat, that's - that's, you know, like 100 years ago or something.              Objectively unreasonable. So come as close as you can to that, where they held reasonable, and what case is it?
09-350 +++$+++ 
09-367 +++$+++              But Congress says -- to paraphrase and not get it accurate -- that the Department of Transportation shall enact a rule governing tire safety within 9 months from the effective date of this legislation.                       And the Department of Transportation fails to do that.                      It doesn't promulgate its law for 18 months.                 Is that law invalid? The rule?              Of course, it isn't.              So how is this different?             I understand that point. I'm just asking what s a relevant difference?             Because?             Why couldn't he?             You just read us the provision.             The judge enters a -- an order, a final order.       And that final judgment, as was true here, says:    I haven't decided restitution yet.            He can appeal.    Then what it says is when you get around to the restitution, then enter another judgment, and you ll appeal that, as happens precisely in the case of the 60 days -- you know, that extra stuff that Justice Scalia was referring to.          That's a possible interpretation of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.    I don't see, you know, the appeals thing.               I don't see anything -- I don't have in front of me the language on filing an appeal, but I can't think of anything that s contrary.             That's right.             It's a final judgment, and because there is another provision that says an order of restitution is itself a final judgment.             You read it to us.   I mean the one you read to us.             What?             Yes, the same problem.             Where does it say that?             Well, this is a court-made rule of what counts as a final judgment.             All right.       Is there anything in the decisions of this Court interpreting that rule?   I mean, you could have collateral orders.               You could have all kinds of things.               And doesn't it boil down to the same question? I mean, I agree with you that if Congress wanted to make a 90-day deadline, you really have to do it, and you can't restitute thereafter.                  All right. That's one thing.     But if they didn't, why didn't they equally intend the judgment without the restitution order to be a final judgment?             And then later on, just as in (o), if the judge does impose an order of restitution, then of course, that's appealable, and that's a different judgment.   Is there -- what in the law prevents the -- that interpretation?               Yes.               So you have precedent.              All right.         Well, what about that as a possible answer?          If we accept -- the -- the judge, of course, could say to the defendant:                   I'm not going to sentence you; I'm not going to put that sentence -- I'm not going to sentence you at all --             -- for 100 days.             And your remedy, then, might be to ask for mandamus, if that was too long a period?             And -- and -- so why wouldn't that be similar here?             If the judge is going to go after the 90 days, he d have the power to do it, but it would be like a continuance, and he d have to exercise that reasonably.             No, no.          I know.     You re interpreting it literally, and --             -- and that's --             But I mean, if I thought, for argument's sake --          -- that Congress doesn't care about whether it's after 90 days -- it was just to sort of speed things up -- on that assumption, wouldn't you still have a remedy, because it would be like the unreasonable continuance?          That is correct?        I've got it?          No, no.         I'm thinking of --          I'm thinking of the general problems --          -- of continuances for sentencing.          And your argument is that days is long enough?             Okay.       I ve got it.             Could you go back to -- could you go back to Justice Alito's question, because --             -- that was exactly the same thing.    I think what he may be saying, though, is it makes more sense to read these statutes as saying imprisonment or community -- or community service, a form of supervised release, or fines -- I don't know about forfeiture -- can be appealed as separate final judgments, because then you don't have to wait for 90 days.             And if you read it that way, it's fairer to the defendant, and you don't have to worry about the restitution appeal because of (o). Now, what blocks the reading -- what blocks the reading I just gave?

09-448 +++$+++               Take the case, though -- just take the -- what is the government's position?                        The ERISA plaintiff wants $5 million.                  They get denied everything.     The -- the court says:                    I noticed here there was a 30-day deadline that you had, and he only gave you 28 days, so I'm sending it back, but I'll tell you your claim that there was enough evidence is absurd; you re never going to win it.               And then he goes back, and he loses it.     Okay?       He has had a procedural victory. Does he get attorney's fees?                     Not -- not a chance that he s going to win this claim, and, indeed, he loses it.     He doesn't get a penny.                Does he get attorney's fees, because on a technicality he won a new hearing?             My question is --             -- does the statute, in the view of the government, permit attorney's fees in the case I just mentioned?             Your answer is, yes --             -- it does permit?             All right.         You re just saying it won't be a problem because the district court judges are all reasonable, and I know they think that. (Laughter.)

09-479 +++$+++        I'm not sure that that's right.     I think that -- that this may well apply to the crime that is being -- that is being prosecuted where the crime is defined as a real offense in the world, with the limitations put on that term by the guidelines. I would think that would be a natural reading, in which case you'd look to the conduct of the person. And if the conduct of the person is such that it calls for a mandatory minimum of a certain kind, there we are.     And if that exceeds this amount, there we are.     You can't apply it.     And if it doesn't, you do apply it.       Have you looked into that? I mean, that was my reading of it as -- in the most natural way.     The word "crime" is ambiguous.     Sometimes it means words in a statute.     Sometimes it means an affair in the world.     And I thought this one probably meant the affair in the world.       Well, I read that -       If that's so, then this gives tremendous power to the prosecutor to decide what the sentence will be in terms of how he manipulates the charge.     And I thought that probably this, read with the guidelines, is designed not to -- not to permit that. It's to minimize the discretion, not to maximize.       I mean, I don't know if it makes any difference.     I mean, has there ever been such a case where the prosecutor worked this in such a way that he would produce this? Are you aware if any such case ever happened?
09-497 +++$+++                 Yes, that's -- that s true. The thing I was wondering in this case is there's a -- a dispute that's about racial discrimination and so forth. There s a clause, and the clause says this is arbitrable, but that is being disputed because the plaintiff in the case says that's an unconscionable provision, so it doesn't really apply.                    And then you say but now that dispute is referred to the arbitrator to just read the language.       But the plaintiff says that that language, too, is unconscionable, and as long as that language is unconscionable, then how is it clear and unmistakable that they, he, agreed to do it, because an unconscionable provision is not a provision? So if we apply First Options -- I mean, it's complicated because of the language; it's not complicated once you think it out, and -- I hope.            But just applying it very literally, it would seem to say that you do not have clear and unmistakable evidence that they agreed to submit this kind of dispute to arbitration for the reason that what you point to is itself according to them a product of unconscionability. How do you -- how do you respond to that?             Well, making itself could be, but I think that's a harder question, whether a -- certainly if the person says you see my signature there; that's not mine; that's Joe Banana's, who tries to imitate me -- there is no contract, and no matter what it says, it doesn't go to the arbitrator. All right? Now, we can argue about whether it is or is not analogous to that when he claims it's unconscionable.     There's a very good argument it is analogous.     There's a very good argument it is like fraud in the inducement, and there are some arguments the other way. But First Options I think cuts through that, by saying whether that's true or not, unless it's clear and unmistakable that they wanted this matter, the matter of whether the arbitration clause itself is unconscionable referred to the arbitrator, whether or not they wanted that referred to the arbitrator has to be clear and unmistakable.             And they are claiming no, because the lack -- the provision that says that is itself a product of unconscionability.                    That's to repeat my question.     But, having repeated the question, why isn't that the simplest, most direct, and four-sentence ground for deciding this case?                He s not saying that this whole arbitration clause is unconscionable?                Well, all right.           So he's -- he s complaining the whole clause is unconscionable, and that's part of the clause.                Yes, and in First Options, we said it wasn t clear and unmistakable.                And the rules were what I just described.             So let's go back to that. Maybe the other way is simpler.               You say you agree that if my defense to this contract, which you are trying to enforce against me or which gives me a right to sue you, look at the argument, you put up this four-page document, and I say:      Look, that is not my signature; that is the signature of Joe Bananas.                   We agree that's for the court.             Okay.       Now, we agree it's for the court if my defense is, what he did is he got me drunk, told me a bunch of lies, and I signed it.                     I grant it's my signature, but look at how squiggly it is. And my will was not a free one because I was under the influence of alcohol and lies.              Okay.       Same.     Okay. That s Prima Paint.              Okay?       Now, he says the reason that I did not sign this contract -- I agree it's my signature; I agree it is not squiggly -- but still my will was overborne.            What was it overborne by? It was overborne by those very situations that lead courts to label contracts unconscionable.                    The reason we don't enforce unconscionable contract is because the person who was the victim had no free will.                    He did not sign it of his own accord.           And that doesn't -- there s no other reason, and that's the basic reason, and therefore assimilate it to the other two.                    What's your response?                Yes, but that's what I want the answer to.     I know you don't agree with it.             What I want is a list of reasons why.                But I'm not interested in arbitration law.     I m interested in contract law, and I want to know why as a general matter of contract law an allegation of unconscionability, defense of unconscionability, is why is it not enough like the coercion defense or the inducement defense or the "I was in Alaska" defense?       Isn't it enough like that that they should be treated alike?           And now you're going to say no, and I want to know why not.              All right.       What is the one-sentence answer, one sentence, to the thing, this is a very interesting case, lots of stuff in it that we needn't reach because irrespective of everything else, they in their reply, the district court, and the court of appeals all said these whole four pages, the whole four pages were unconscionable, so none of it s enforceable, and all we have to decide is whether that's an issue for the court.          And the answer to that being not an issue for the court is what, in a sentence or two?              They said, look, there s a four-page document.       They said this four-page document is unconscionable, the product of unconscionability, and, therefore, don't enforce it.              That's their claim.       That issue is at least is for the court, because there is no valid agreement here at all, if that's right.
09-520 +++$+++ 
09-5201 +++$+++               Well, why do you do have to do that?   I mean you read it.            It so complicated.          Just reading this, I -- I think the language should say this: 10 years, he's got a 10-year sentence.                  At the end of the first year you write the number 54 on a piece of paper if he has done well. Suppose he comes in on January 1, okay?                     So January 2, after the first year, you write the word 50 -- the number 54.      And you do that each year.                 And by the time you get to the year 8, what you have done is you have got 432 days. So then you subtract the 430 days from 10 years, and what you get is you are 67 days short of 9 years.     So now you look at the last sentence, and what you do is you take 67 days, subtract that from 365, and you've got 298, and you simply prorate for those 298. And you subtract that, too, so he gets another 10 days or so, or 15 days credit, and that's it. And that's following the statute, it seems to me, absolutely literally.              And it also seems to me to make sense, because you don't want to give him credit for time he never serves.              No, that isn't what the - if you want to know what the sentencing commission did, I think the best evidence of that is you read the introduction to the guidelines.                 And what the introduction to the guidelines says is that, roughly speaking, many of the sentences approximate the time actually served before. Now, what to me that suggests is that the sentencing commission never considered this question. And if there's something more specific than that, that shows they did, I would like to know what it is, because I don't trust memory.              But there is nothing in there -- that's not a policy statement; that's not a guideline.   That's a staff conclusion.                  And the staff conclusion, I think, is conflicting with what it says in the -- in the introduction to the guidelines, which is that all of this was very approximate.                 I don't see how -- how -- a court would be bound by that.             Is this right?   I'm -- I'm sorry to ask you this question, but I get lost in the math of this sometimes. Do you remember my example I just gave, you know, with the 9 years you go and put it on a piece of paper?              I take it what you want is you, in -- in essence, want him to get credit for 54 days for that tenth year?             Yes.      And the argument against that, reading the language and so forth, is, well, look this is an imaginary 10th year.                       He is not actually in prison for 10 years.                 He is going to be released sometime late in year 8.                  And so why should we add 54 days?     I mean maybe it would be a nice thing because sentences are awfully long, but -- but why would anybody want to add 54 days in respect to a year that's never going to be served?               Another way to think, and I think probably you'll -- if you look through the records of the commission, they even thought about this problem, and the -- the -- you will see a lot of talks given by various people who were there, which say that for this reason you are bringing up, that it might have been thought there was no credit for the first year. In other words, you don't cut the sentence in the first year.      You don't begin cut until the second year has been served, so he has to serve 365 days.                 Now when you point that out, that is not the Bureau of Prisons's interpretation, that's nobody's interpretation.    They're all going to let him out if it's a year and a day.        They are going to let him out several weeks before the end of the first year, aren't they?             Everybody's going to do that.    Oh -- there was a technical amendment.             That's what happened.      In other words, the statute made before -             Ah, I better get that -
09-525 +++$+++        What -- what happens if the president of the oil company, knowing that the statement is false, says:     We have discovered 42 trillion barrels of oil in Yucatan.     He writes it on a piece of paper; he gives it to the board of trustees; they think it's true and they issue it.     Joe Smith buys stock and later loses money. Can Joe Smith sue the president of Yucatan, of the oil company, for having made an untrue statement of material fact?       What he is, is he didn't issue it.     What he did was he gave it to the board of trustees, who issued it.       He's the president of the company.       No, no.     I'm asking what happens.     Is there recovery?       He is running the business, the daily affairs, of the company.     Of course, the president of a company is an authorized agent of the company, and so, yes.       Now, if he's subject to liability, why isn't your firm -- your client, subject to liability, who, after all, run every affair of the fund?       Yes, that's what a president does.     The president of a company manages the company.       And if the president is liable, why isn't the group of people who do everything for the company -       -- why aren't they liable?       -- and I want to know. That's an obvious, naive question, and I'd like an answer that anyone could understand.       I get it.     In other words, you're saying, on the papers here, it's -- it's the trustees that manage everything.       That govern everything, and these are like helpers?       They do a lot as helpers. Now, let me suggest to you, if that's one possible distinction, what about this distinction:     That the managers of a fund, even though they are outsourced people brought in, are liable as principals, not aiders or abettors, if -- following criminal law here -- if - they are principals if they get the false statement to the public through a conduit, the conduit being an entity or person that is unaware of the falsity of the statement. That's LaFave on criminal law.     What is - what about that?
09-529 +++$+++        I thought -- this I'm confused about.     I would think you would have to have a State which has a law that permits the attorney general to sue the governor.     Wouldn't you?       I mean, if the State law is the attorney general can't sue the governor, that's the end of it, isn't it?     Or is it -       No.     Suppose the State law is the governor of the State cannot bring a lawsuit against the attorney general, and vice versa.     Okay? That's the State law.     Now, under those circumstances, can either bring a lawsuit on a Federal right in Federal court?       No, but I want just a yes or no answer.     In your opinion, can an attorney general, where the State law says, black letter law, attorney general can never sue the governor; he's fired instantly if he tries.     That's the law in this State, okay?     Now, can that individual come into Federal court and sue on an Ex parte Young theory suing the governor?       He could?       Well, I don't -- I think that is a problem, and is that -       -- what we're saying here?       But my -- excuse me -- I thought -       Suppose I'm right about this and you can't do it.     You can't.     You can't -- the Federal Government cannot tell a State how to organize itself.     If it wants to have an attorney general that can never bring a lawsuit, that's up to the State, unless it's a due process problem. Now, suppose I believe that.     Now, do you lose this case?       Suing in his capacity as attorney general and under his -- that's the plaintiff, not the defendant.     And he has no right to bring that suit, because -- it's not that he doesn't have a right; it's that he doesn't have authority.     He's not a person that can do this kind of thing -       Yes, right.     Exactly.       That's your position.       I'm with Justice Scalia on this.     Well, I'll pass to the other side.       Have you found any case - are there a lot, a few, none -- where one State agency at a State level sues another in Federal court, period? Say they have "arising under" jurisdiction.       Well, are there any?       None?       See, nagging at me is some kind of Article III problem.       And maybe there is none.     I don't know.     It's -- there are none, though?     None?       No, no.     It wouldn't have to.     All -- they could get into all kinds of arguments about EPA and all kinds of Federal rights with each other.     I would think.       Yes.
09-530 +++$+++ 
09-5327 +++$+++ 
09-559 +++$+++           Can you go back --
09-571 +++$+++        Well, how is that so?     The -- I've read the instruction that the court gave, and it seemed to me the instruction the Court gave was word-for-word taken from Canton.     And when I read the question that you presented in your Petitioner's brief -- in the petition for cert, I thought what this case was about was an instance where there was only -- it was conceded that there was only one such instance. But then when I read your second reiteration of the question, which is a little different, and read the briefs, I thought no, there are four other ones. And so what you're really asking us to do is to decide in the case of perfect instructions whether the evidence supports them.     I didn't think I was getting into that, and, frankly, as raised, the brief I think clearly supports it, but others could disagree.     But why are we getting into that business in this Court?       All right.     Then what is it you're asking?     Is there something in the instructions that is wrong?     What?       What?       Sorry.     Where -- I'm reading the instruction.     I have it here.     What is it? I'm not saying you're wrong.     I'm just saying, what in the words stated are wrong?     And where is the request that they be stated differently?     That I should look at that, and that they weren't.     Okay.       What are the words -- I mean, it looked to me like the words on page 828 are pretty similar to my copy of what he actually said.     So what are the words on page 828 that you think he should have said that he didn't say?       All right.     What he says here is, "The situation involved a difficult choice or one that the prosecutors had a history of mishandling, such that additional training, supervision, or monitoring was clearly needed." So it looks to me like, unless I'm reading the wrong page, which I've sometimes done out of my memo here.     It looks to me like he gave those words.       I'm saying what is it that you asked the judge to do that he didn't do or that you asked him not to do that he did do?     That's what happens.     That's the way you object to an instruction.       Okay.     So what is that?       I want you to point out in the record the words that were said to the district court saying, Judge, I want you to say this, and then the judge didn't do it.       Which is where?       Then I think we take it as saying that you not objecting to what -- to instruction.       I mean, your whole brief is objecting to the instruction, and you didn't include the objection?       Wait, wait.     If you don't object to the instruction, then we're back to what I'm saying, that what you're objecting to is you don't think the evidence was such that, given that instruction, the jury could find guilt.     And that's what I thought this case wasn't about to begin with, and there are three other instances.     So I don't see why, given this instruction, the jury couldn't find guilt.       All right.     But, look -- I -- he read the instructions.     They came right out of Canton.     Seems perfect. Now you're saying, well, whether they did or not, you cannot have an incident -- you can't have liability if there's only one incident.     And at that point, I say, gee, I don't know.     I mean, maybe it depends on what the incident is.     Maybe the incident involved somebody saying, hey, Brady?     What's Brady?     Or somebody saying, what's a criminal trial?     I mean, that person needs training. And -- or -- but I don't even have to think of that here, because there were four incidents here. And, therefore, I don't have to try to make up weird hypotheticals.     So where we have four instances and we have correct instructions, what's the problem?       Okay.     Okay.     We have -- we have -- all this case?     I thought that they had several instances in other cases.       All involved -- in other words, there has never in this office been an instance of a Brady violation outside of this case.       After, that's what it was.       Ah.     There were four Brady violations involving this office, okay?       All right.     So now we're talking about not one; we are talking about four --   -- over many years, with tens of thousands of violations, correct?       This is helpful.     Thank you.       So we have to overturn the jury finding?       We don't?       Because they found that the failure to adequately train amounted to deliberate indifference to the fact that inaction would obviously result in a constitutional violation.     That's what they found. Now, how can we -- assuming that's true and accepting it and not overturning it -- find that there was something unlawful?     Because you're arguing -- you're all arguing about whether the training program really was adequate or not.     They found it was not. What do we do?
09-5801 +++$+++        Well -- I'm sorry.     Go ahead.     Finish. Are you finished?       I didn't quite follow this. As I understand it, on what -- say:     On what remedy will there be if you're right?     This is what I don't understand. A child is born abroad.     One parent is American; the other is foreign.     If the two are married, that child is American only if the father or the mother -- one or the other -- has lived in the United States for now at least 2 years.     It used to be more. Okay?     Now it's 5 years after the age of 16. Now suppose they are not married, and suppose the American is the father.     Same rule. Now suppose they are not married and the American is the mother.     Now it's not 5 years or 2 years; you only have to have lived here for one year. Suppose I agree with you.     I just don't see any sense to that whatsoever.     I can't figure it out.     They made a mistake about the immigration laws.     Suppose I agree with you. Then why isn't the remedy, say:     Okay, whether it is the father or the mother, the general rule applies.     They have to have lived in the United States for 5 years or for 2 years?     Now 2 years.       Some people were lucky, and they are already citizens under this, and there we are, because their mother lived in the United States for one year.     Those already are citizens.     Nobody is going to take that away.     We are just looking at a statute. And in the first part of the statute, they have in section (g) of 1401, the first rule I told you about.     In 1409(a), the second rule, and in 1409(c), the third rule. Okay.     If you are right about this, and it's totally unfair and there is no good reason whatsoever for distinguishing on the basis of gender, we strike (g).     Okay? Now, that would seem to be normal, but that isn't going to help your client.     So how do you get to some other thing that instead of striking (g)?     What we do is strike all of (a) and strike the whole thing before, and shove them all into (g), which isn't so easy to do with this language.     How do you get there?       Fine.     So we strike (g). What I'm worried about is, you want me to strike (a) - sorry, we strike (c).     And you want me to strike 1409(a) and 1401(g), and shove the people who are there into (g), which is a little tough to do in the English language.     But I want to know how you get there.       Now, there's another slight problem with that, I would think.     Reading this carefully, which I hope I have done, it seems to me it may also discriminate against fathers.     And that's because (c) says that the woman has to have been physically present for a continuous period of one year. I read at least one article that says that word, "continuous," doesn't appear with the fathers, and that they really mean it.     That is, if somebody is living down in Texas and they happen to go visit on Christmas their father, who is -- or their grandmother or cousin or something who is across the border for 5 minutes, that they cannot take advantage of this clause (c). Is that true?       I will ask the (g) that, but if it is true -- if it is true, then -- then I would think that the fathers are really worse off.     I don't know if that helps you.     And maybe it could turn out that that's really a problem. If it is really a problem, then the fathers are worse off.     Does that help you with the remedy?       The question is looking for a way -- I'm trying to be helpful in my question.     I'm looking for a way that you can get to your result.     Now I'm not saying I would do it, but I just want to know what the best way is of getting to that result, where you shove everyone into (c) instead of just cutting (c).       That would help you.     Is there a reason for doing that?
09-587 +++$+++        Was there a procedural issue in this case before the California Supreme Court?       What was that?       But if, in this case, they did reject it on a procedural ground, and it was a reasonable ground that they applied consistently, then the Ninth Circuit or the Federal courts couldn't consider the claim at all; is that right?       If, in fact, the -- they are right, if in fact that the State was correct that this is procedurally barred -- they should have raised it earlier; they didn't -- and if that was correct and reasonable and proper under both Federal and State law, then you shouldn't be in this subject at all; is that right or not?       So, normally, to decide a matter on a substantive -- to have a presumption that they were deciding it substantively rather than procedurally will help a defendant, though not in this case.       Is it fair to say that this -- in this case, that every party in the lower courts assumed this was going to be a merits-related issue and that some deference was due, and that nobody ever said anything about it being a procedural issue where there would be a procedural bar of some kind that was either waived or not waived?       The first time anybody mentioned this procedural issue was when?       That was on the merits brief in opposition?       There was nothing before that?       Is there any reason not to do this?     I'm just thinking from our point of view -- I mean, I think it's probably correct what you say: Nobody mentioned a word about this procedural issue until the brief in opposition on the merits, not the cert brief.     And the reason they did was perfectly legitimate:     We'd asked the question. Well, if we were wrong to do that, could - and if we took the opinion as being a question of reasonable deference, et cetera, and went into it, is there anything -- any reason not to put in that opinion somewhere, given Ylst and given the Ninth Circuit, it would be helpful if the California Supreme Court, for future reference, explained what their practice does in fact mean, whether it's procedural or whether it's on the merits?       All right.
09-60 +++$+++            I don't know.   It seems to me you go further than you need to and, moreover, imagine a State offense that just says possession of marijuana, zero to 5 years.         Now, our problem is, reading those words, is that or is that not analogous to a Federal -- a Federal -- what a Federal law would make a felony?   And suppose you discovered as a matter of fact that all the people who did have a prior conviction got more than a year.    In simple possession, they got less than a year, which you d have to do research to find out.           Well, if those were the facts, I would say it is analogous to the Federal felony where this person was sentenced to more than a year.           Well, we could argue that one --           -- but I don't see where -- that there s a line, because it seems to me the rule is set forth -- we said in the last sentence here of -- what's the case?    You know -- Lopez?  Is that --           Yes, Lopez.     It says state offense constitutes a  felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act  only if it proscribes conduct."    So we re not looking at what happened in reality.    We re reading some words from a State statute.           That's what proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that Federal law. This would be normal.     We get some words in the State statute, and you have to decide are the -- those words cover some events in the world.             And you look at those words, what -- the events they cover and discover, did they or are they analogous or not analogous to what is a felony under Federal law?            Sometimes that's easy, sometimes it's not. You have a case, I think, that's easy.               But I can imagine the case you re talking about, not easy.           So you say, what do you do? I see no rule there.     I see no rule absolute how you treat it, so I probably would treat it by trying to look at what really happens under this statute in the world.           Why -- where does it say "offense element"?           Where does it say that?           Why?        Well, where in the statute --        -- does it say "offense elements"?        Yes.        Well, you say that it says "elements."   I don't see any of our cases that say "elements."   And I -- and I think that -- that what we could do is look to the conduct that's likely to be at issue under these State words, and if in fact it's regular that the State does punish people for more than a year when in fact they do possess for the third time, at least there would be a good argument --        -- that that counts.        You want to argue it doesn't count, okay.               I don't know why you do.           But, I mean, I'm interested in why you do, since that isn't your case.           I know, but the reason I ask my question is it seems to me your approach, which I think is consistent with Lopez and Nijhawan absolutely --        -- does raise the question you are talking about.      So I want to know:          Why are you talking about it?   Because I might be missing something, because I don't think -- if I'm right, your case doesn't raise these issues.    Or am I wrong about that?        Okay.      Well, skip the question. (Laughter.)        Well, that s -- that --        Because she got to that argument at the end, and she said my -- I wrote that, I think, and I -- when I used as an example or the text uses an example, this provision is one where you don't look to real conduct. She said that was a mistake, really.          It was overstated, because what they re saying is that recidivism analogous to the $10,000 was meant to be a real conduct aspect, not just offense of conviction, and -- and she gave similar reasons.            That's why -- similar reasons are that the States are too mixed up in this; it will be too difficult to look at that element itself.    So she s trying to analogize that to the $10,000. Now, why isn't that a good analogy?
09-6338 +++$+++         So what's -- what's the -- the words in the statute is that it may reduce the term. You can t change the term -- you cannot change a sentence, except that you can reduce the term if such reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements.        Do you see anything -- what's -- what's unconstitutional about that?            Then they issue a policy statement, and the policy statement says you can't reduce it except insofar as our new -- whatever the new thing is -- applies. If you re arguing that that violates the Constitution, what I m missing is why?             What violates the Constitution in that?          I don't remember --          I thought in Booker -- and I have to go back and look at it, but I thought in Booker the Court held that certain specific -- like certain specific words in certain specific provisions of the -- the sentencing statutes were unconstitutional because of Apprendi and because of the other part, Booker itself. Well, 3582 wasn't one of them.            So -- so there must be something unconstitutional if you re right.   I don't see how you get around this statute.          All right.      If it's not unconstitutional, then why don't you have to follow it? Because what it says is, you cannot get a reduction except in respect to what the policy guideline says. And the policy guideline says you don't get a reduction, except insofar as we ve reduced a sentence in a particular respect. What's unconstitutional about that?         I'm -- I'm not saying there isn't.           I want to know what your argument is that it is unconstitutional.           Well, that's what it says. I don't know how you d interpret it some other way --           -- if that's what it says.           No, it just says what we're doing is we re reopening the sentencing in respect to the particular way we reduce people's sentence, not in respect to something else.          That's what I read the policy statement to say.        That if there were 19 things that were considered in the sentence and one of those 19 is changed in a downward direction, then it says we make an exception, says the policy statement.               You can reopen number 19, but not the first 18. Now, why is that unconstitutional?            What in the Constitution prohibits doing that?          You agree.       Now -- now, what -- that's what I -- I could understand that if 3582 said to the judge you resentence him.              But it doesn't say that.   So there s a sentence in effect, and what 3582 says is a -- a sentence can be reduced just as if, to go back to the beginning, Congress passed a statute or the Commission said everybody's sentence will be reduced.     That doesn't change what the sentence was.               It says there s a reduction, like for good -- good time. So it says a defendant, if he has been sentenced based on factor 19 in the case, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, the term of imprisonment there under the sentence.               So I'm back to my question. What s unconstitutional about that?          And what the court just says is the court -- the Commission says:               That's right.   You may reduce it in respect to what we ve considered; you may not reduce it in respect to something which is not considered. So I'm still puzzled about the constitutional problem.          No, no, you don't have to apologize.          I understand your argument now.   And I didn't quite and now I do.            So there s nothing to apologize for.          You wanted to get the idea in my mind.     I'm not expressing that in my question, but I got your answer.          Well, that s what it says. It s -- the other thing that has bothered me, to tell you the truth, is -- is the part of the point that was brought up previously, that it is up to the Commission whether to make it retroactive.     It is.          I don't know why they couldn't take into account that to make any drug-related change, you see, and then make that retroactive, is going to reopen the sentencing for every single person who has already been convicted of a drug crime in the Federal courts, of which there are probably tens of thousands. And -- and I think they would properly take that into account.   And, therefore, they might properly say, we're not going to make this retroactive.          Yes, but they do if Congress says they do.
09-658 +++$+++        But you have to, don't you? I mean, what's the alternative?     I mean, imagine a case where it's clear there was a malpractice or an inadequate assistance, and it happened a long time ago and now you have to decide, well, was it prejudicial or not?     It's prejudicial if in the absence of that he would have gone to trial or wouldn't have pleaded guilty, or -- and what's the alternative to trying to figure out whether that's so?       It can't be the State always wins and it can't be the defendant always wins. So -- so what's the alternative?       Oh, but that is -- isn't that -- sorry, maybe we are just quibbling.     I -- I don't quite see it.     That would seem to me to be going into the plea bargaining process.     Would he have pleaded guilty, what would have happened?       If -- if he had gone to trial, what's the sentence -- what's the range of sentence he could have gotten?       And if they had gone back to the grand jury, as the prosecutor I guess could have done, it could have gone to the grand jury?       It could have gone to the grand jury.     Then what is the maximum he could have gotten?
09-6822 +++$+++        Is there a guideline that says that there cannot be a departure for rehabilitation after an initial sentencing that's set aside?       No.     So there's no guideline.     So as far as the answer to Justice Ginsburg -- what I thought was her question, that is - the guidelines initially said that the Commission has the power to limit departures -       -- but it doesn't do it, except for race and gender -       -- and age.     That's right. So under the guidelines, a judge can depart for any reason except those few forbidden things, which I think are properly forbidden.       Yes.     Yes.     And -       And -- and that's still the law.     That's still the law.       And so it's -- it's the circuits that have made this thing up.       Well, what would the source of law be to make up such a thing?     I mean, what is the source -       What law gives the right to the -- to -- a -- a circuit, to make that up, would have to say it was an unreasonable thing to do. Now, I guess you could have an argument either way on that, but it doesn't strike me off the bat as unreasonable, where a person has rehabilitated himself, to take that into account.       And we would have the power to say that.       I wasn't going to bring that up.       No -       Wait.     Which guideline? What guideline prohibits that?       Why?       But the -- the thing that's worrying me about -- and I don't think -- I agree with you on policy, but what I'm -- what I'm having trouble with is:     Is it better under the law to say yes, we can interpret 3742(g) so it can be constitutional, and then if in some cases it violates Apprendi, let the court say that in this case it violates Apprendi. But it just isn't clear to me, which is why I left it alone the first time.     It's not clear.     So - so -- as to when it is, when it isn't constitutional. You got my whole question there?       And I'd appreciate as much answer as you can give me.       You think that violates Apprendi?       The answer to this case is, I don't think, too hard.     You say it's at least questionable enough, 42(g) you could say, at least questionable enough that it's the same box as the ones that were excised.       And then there has not been focus in the district court on what the district court would want to do, assuming he is free to apply the guidelines or not, on the remand decision that that judge has never made.       Is that right?       They didn't say -- forget that argument.     What I was about -       I do have another point I'd like to get out, as long as I have this opportunity.     It seems to me there's a considerable confusion, perhaps, only from my point of view, but this word "variance" -- I mean, why is it felt necessary to use the word "variance"?     If it's true -- and it's not totally true, but if it's true the judge -- you can apply the guideline, apply it.     Now, the guidelines themselves gives you the right to depart in every single case but, for example, a handful of factors such as race, where you really shouldn't change the thing just because of race.     So what is the need for the variance? Now, maybe this 5K9-point whatever that is -- maybe there are a handful where there is a need, and maybe this is an example of it.     But are there a lot, many, what -- can you just talk a little bit about it?       It's just a policy statement.     Does it enjoy the same status of law?       Oh, I get it.
09-737 +++$+++        How would you put the rule about when you have to renew a motion?     You move for summary judgment.     Can you say this?     You've looked up the treatises and so forth.     If the motion for summary judgment involves either a question of fact or a mixed question of fact and law, it has to be renewed.     If it involves neither of the others, neither of those two things, but it's a pure question of law and not mixed, it doesn't have to be renewed.       Is there any authority for that?     I mean, is there any -- it seems to be roughly what you're trying to argue, roughly.     At least it seems to me a rule that would make sense.     Is it that -- what do you find related to that?     It seems to me that must have been thought about before this minute.       Not necessarily by you, but by somebody.       Yes, but let's imagine it has nothing to do with qualified immunity.       A bread-and-butter case.       You can't appeal a denial of motion for summary judgment.     But there's a trial and the lawyer forgets to renew the motion.     So sometimes he's lost it; I guess sometimes he hasn't.     I would think he would have lost it if it's a mixed question of fact or law or if it's a pure question of fact that the answer turns on.     I would think he hadn't lost it if in fact it's a pure question of law.     But is that the basic hornbook rule out of this context?
09-751 +++$+++        I'm not certain that this is about the funeral.     I mean, I understand there was a funeral in it, but the First Amendment question seems to me a different -- possibly a broader and different question.     Did your client see the signs?     I gather from the record he didn't see what the signs were; he just saw tops of signs.     So he didn't read anything on the signs; is that right?       So he hadn't seen them.     So how does -- how did your client find out that the signs, the tops of which he saw at the funeral when the demonstrators were standing with the approval of the police, 300 feet away -- how did he find out what they said?       Did they say in -- my question is, how did your client find out these very objectionable things on the signs?     How did he find out what they said?       Yes, that's what I'm interested in.       Okay.     So now we have two questions.     One is, under what circumstances can a group of people broadcast on television something about a private individual that's very obnoxious?     And because of the funeral, you said that -- I accept that from your point of view; that is very obnoxious.     And the second is, to what extent can they put that on the Internet, where the victim is likely to see it?     Either on television or by looking it up on the Internet. Now, those are the two questions that I'm very bothered about.     I don't know what the rules ought to be there.     That is, do you think that a person can put anything on the Internet?     Do you think they can put anything on television even if it attacks, say, the most private things of a private individual?     Does Maryland's -- does Maryland's law actually prohibit that?     We know it does.     And what should the rules be there? Have I said enough to get you talking? (Laughter.)       Well, you can go ahead and finish --       I'm quite interested.       What about the -- taking -- if you have an instance where the defendant has said on television or on the Internet something absolutely outrageous.     You show that.     You show that it was intended to and did inflict serious emotional suffering. You show that any reasonable person would have known that likelihood.     And then the defendant says:     Yes, I did that, but in a cause, in a cause.     And now -- in a cause that we are trying to demonstrate how awful the war is. At that point, I think the First Amendment might not leave this alone.     But if it's not going to leave this alone, there's where we need a rule or we need an approach or we need something to tell us how the First Amendment in that instance will begin to -- enter and force a balancing. Is it that you want to say no -- no punitive damages in such a case?     Or that you would have to insist upon a particularly clear or a reasonable connection between the private part of this and the public effort? Have you thought about that at all?     Because that's where I am thinking and having trouble.       Hustler -- Hustler v. Falwell is defamation.       Intentional infliction, okay, good.     Thank you.     Go ahead.       Well, answer then, please.       Compelling.
09-804 +++$+++        So far we're just discussing, I take it, whether under (1) the other side is entitled to their benefits even if they weren't hurt, on a contract theory.       All right.     But I thought we took the case to decide a different issue.       And that is -- I'll assume you're right -- it should have come under (3).     But I don't know if that's harmful, whether it was (3) or (1). And the question I thought we were to decide was, if you're under (3), say, where equity is at issue, now equity is at issue and the district court says:     Here we have 27,000 people, and now here's how I'm going to go about this.     I'm going to look at this provision mistake here, and the mistake it seems to me was likely to cause them harm.     And once that's shown -- and they showed it, it's likely to cause it harm; we can't be sure, but it's likely -- then it's up to your client to refute case by case that these guys were not -- or women were not really harmed.     Okay? Now, that seems very sensible to me.     And - and if that's the issue we're going to decide, I'd like to hear you explain why that isn't sensible.     It's an equitable matter.     This is simply a way of going about it.     What's wrong with that?       I agree, but I don't understand -- I'm with you on this one so far.       You're sounding to me as if you're saying there wasn't likely harm.     Okay.       Are you conceding that the standard that they used, that the standard was -- the question that you raised at the beginning, whether - whether the showing of likely harm is sufficient in the absence of a rebuttal?       All right.     That's what I want to hear:     What's the argument against that standard?       All right.     And does "likely harm" capture that idea?       Why not?     Why not?       That's the kind of harm they mean.     What they mean -       -- by harm is they were hurt, brought about by reliance.       You object to this decision saying the following:     Of course, the lower court said likely harm is necessary.     As we understand it, given the context of equity, what that means here is that there was reason to believe -- reason to believe -- it was probable that, or some words like that, that there would have been harm caused by reliance on the -- the misstatement.       Maybe it wouldn't be too hard.     They're -- they're joined as members of the class in light of a certain set of characteristics, and the judge would find that, other things being equal, individuals who have that set of characteristics which in this circumstance make them members of the class would be harmed in all likelihood, okay?     Done. Now, it's up to -- it's up to the -- the defendant then to show that in a particular case this individual wasn't harmed.       Why?       Well, it depends on the facts.     Maybe they have a union or -       (j).       Yes, but I still have the same question Justice Scalia had, which is -- which is why didn't this (h) thing apply here, because they didn't have -- their claim, the notice wasn't good, and if the notice wasn't good, then -- the plan didn't change, and if the plan didn't change, they should have gotten the money.     Why didn't it -- why?
09-834 +++$+++        Why do you feel the need to go beyond, say, what the AFL-CIO identifies as a normal oral failing -- filing?     They use language like, at the initial stage of the grievance procedure, there is confrontation with an eye to fact finding, and the dispute is joined when the employee or the steward or supervisor come face-to-face to identify, to discuss, and hopefully to resolve a problem. Now that's a formal kind of relationship. It doesn't involve a cocktail party, and yet it is done orally.     And there is a tradition as to how that works. But from you've said, I gather that you want to go well beyond that and provide that cocktail parties -- perhaps not cocktail parties, but just a tap on the shoulder would be sufficient, where I take it that would normally be sufficient in the grievance process.       All right.     Suppose I think that that provides a good precedent for -- for oral filings.     What happens then?     What am I supposed to do in your case?       Yes, we are talking about a filing.     In the grievance process -- I don't want to repeat it, but it seems to me form having read the brief that filing takes place without writing, provided that there are these other safeguards which are described. Now, I want to know in your opinion, is there a reason for not importing that into this system? I take it you win the case -- or maybe you lose it, I don't know how it works on the fact.     I don't know what the filing was.       There is a word "filing" in the AFL-CIO statute as well.     So I am looking for a way of interpreting the one in light of the other.     Do you favor that?     Are you against that?     If so, why or why not?       Yes.     Fine.     It's a perfectly normal use of speech, I accept that.     But what is it that would surround this use of speech on a particular occasion with enough formality that we know it isn't something that could pass unnoticed and bring in a whole lot of things like the cocktail party example, et cetera? I noticed there was a paragraph in the AFL-CIO -- that's why I brought it up.     Is that the right standard?     What we say here may take effect or have influence, so -- so I want to say it correctly. What kinds of oral complaints count as filing a complaint?       But I would like more than that.     The Government sees these statutes as a whole, so I would like the Government's assistance on what words to write to be able to get this right so it will not be too formal, it will not be too informal, it will do the job.       All right.     Now, fill in this blank then, there must be surrounding the oral complaint sufficient elements of formality such that -       But -- but there have been years and years of -- you have just said, of statutes like this, you say that many of them operate orally. All right.     What kind of thing, if you can help, maybe you can't -- which is dangerous, but then we just try to do our best, and we don't have the labor law experience necessarily, but -- but what is the -- the form of words that we can use to separate the wheat from the chaff?       Let me see if I can look, because in about 2 minutes you are going to hear, I suspect and the other side, say see, see, we told you, that's why you have to have it in writing.
09-837 +++$+++        Is it -- is it -- the - the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question -- I was uncertain.     Suppose a student is working 45 hours a week in the grounds department cutting lawns, and he does - cutting the school lawn, and he earns enough money to help with his way through college.     Now, I thought, under this, that he is not within this statute because it's 45 hours and not 40?       All right.       That it's not -- okay. So -- so, what they're doing is -- it started out with the word "student" and the word "service performed" in the statute.     Then, for many, many years, they have talked about the employment, how it has to be an incident to the study.     And "incident" is the key word. And so now what they've done is interpret their own word "incident" as saying if it bulks too large in comparison with the -- with the studying, it's not incident to the study; it's a separate thing.     And that's true whether it happens to be medical school or it happens to be lawn mowing.     They can't -- they don't want it as so big in comparison to the study that it's not really part of trying to get the study.     It's just too big.     And they use the 40 for that.       All right.     Now, if you're going to admit the word "incident to," if you're saying they have the right to put the word "incident to," why don't they have the right to define "incident to" in part in terms of 40 hours a week?       No, no, it didn't as interpreted.     You see, it's not -- it's that -- I concede everything you say:     It's a total learning experience, and it's a special learning experience.     The problem I was having that I wanted your answer to is that they have for many, many years said:     Just because it's a pure learning experience and nothing but a pure learning experience, you still can't get this exemption unless the work is incident to that experience.     And by "incident" we mean it can't bulk too large -       -- in respect to the whole. So the problem for you is not that it's not education.       It's that the work is the education.       I looked it up in the dictionary, and the meaning number 1 b of "incident" is: an accompanying minor occurrence or -- occurrence or condition.     Minor.     In other words, there's the big thing, and then there's the incident. Now, if that's the meaning, well, this says 40 is trying to get at whether it's minor or the whole -       Well, that's because -       And here what it says is -       It says or resulting from something else of greater or principal import. So they're trying to work out, with that word "incident," is the studying of greater or principal import?     And what they're saying is, when it's 40 hours a week, this other thing, the studying, is not of greater import.       Rather, it's, let's say, of equal import.       If you have to draw the line -
09-846 +++$+++        Is there any instance you've been able to think of where an Indian tribe could have a claim for money of some kind and some other kind of relief that they seek where they couldn't get it all in the Court of Claims?       Declaratory judgment.     Is there anything else?       No injunctive relief.       No matter what.     Okay. Well, then they have a problem, because they might want -- they might want some money and they want an injunction.     So what are they supposed to do?       That's a big choice.       Your basic point is this You're just saying it's too bad, go to Congress.     But you don't deny the basic point, which is that an Indian tribe may think the Bureau of Indian Affairs has really mismanaged everything and what they would like is some money, and also they want an injunction so they won't do it again. And now your view is, it's true, there is no way they can get that, because they have to go to two different courts, and really in your view they can't go to two different courts, period.       And hardship is definite. It's just you are saying, that's what Congress wanted.       Why isn't it just as bad as what I just said?
09-868 +++$+++        That's called "it's illegal."       So now it's illegal.       And the odd thing is that -- that kind of appeal takes place either days or possibly weeks after the defendant may already have appealed his conviction to the higher court.       Is that right?       That normally happens?       And what I'm curious about is what happens if the court affirms that sentence, let's say 2 months after it already affirmed the conviction?       Which is the judgment pursuant to which -- which is the judgment that became final by conclusion of direct review?       Why?       The person is not being held in custody pursuant to a judgment of the State court, or at least a relevant judgment, until the sentence has been appealed.     Then there's the conclusion of direct review in respect to the judgment in respect to which he is being held in custody.     I'm just reading the statute -       -- the Federal statute.       Exactly.       And that's why I don't - that's why I am confused.     I look at the language of the Federal statute and it seems to me that this individual is not being held in custody pursuant to a judgment until that sentence is final.       And the sentence is final in the lower court, but they say when the sentence is final at the conclusion of direct review in respect to that sentence, which hasn't even taken place yet.       Okay.     Then you're going to say -       -- all appeals in Rhode Island from sentences -- all appeals on their lawfulness or their mercy take place under Rule 35, and all of them are collateral.
09-893 +++$+++        I thought that Discover Bank is the California case that sets it out; is that correct?       So that's California law. And what they say in Discover Bank is -- they are talking about class waivers in both arbitration contracts and not arbitration contracts.     And they say they are void when it's a consumer contract of adhesion, when they predictably involve small amounts of damages, when it is claimed that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme deliberately to cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money, and the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party from responsibility for its own fraud. Now, seems to -- those seem to be the principles that apply.     Those principles apply to litigation.     They apply to arbitration.     What's the problem?     They don't say anything there about the things you mention.     They just mention four things, which I just read.       No.     I would guess it's like Switzerland having a law saying, we only buy milk from cows who are in pastures higher than 9,000 feet. That discriminates against milk from the rest of the continent.     But to say we want cows that have passed the tuberculin test doesn't.     So I guess we have to look at the particular case. And here, my impression is -- correct me if I am wrong -- the class arbitration exists.     It's not a -- it's not like having a jury trial.     You could have it in arbitration.     You can have it in litigation.     So where is the 9,000-foot cow, or whatever it is?     Where is the discrimination?       Why, why, why?       Why?     That's I think what Justice Kagan is getting at.     If a State wants to have a doctrine which says, you have to have a seal of a certain kind on certain kinds of contracts, they've never done it before, but now they do it, and on that kind you have to have a seal both on the arbitration contract and on the other.     And here what they've done is they have listed the four characteristics from Discover Bank, and they've said all contracts to do with litigation have to satisfy those four. At which point I think Justice Kagan said, so what if they've never done this before?     They sure have done it now.     And what's the basis for saying that the Arbitration Act or any other part of Federal law forbids California from doing that?
09-9000 +++$+++        I assume that this whole case focuses on paragraph 33 of your complaint; is that right?       And what is the "but"?       So, what's -- look, 33 says the District Attorney has violated my rights under the law by refusing to give me the DNA evidence, so make him do it. That's how I read 33.       But not the relief.     That's your complaint. You explain why you think it violates Federal law for him not to do it.     You ask him to do it. Is there anything else to this case?       But that's why you are entitled to the relief.  Is there anything else in the case that you want?  You want the DNA evidence?       He said, and I -       I mean, if you agree with that, I guess there's nothing left of this case.       But I -- but do you agree with that?
09-907 +++$+++        You do.     You do, but the difficulty that I -- I don't get the answer to Justice Ginsburg's first question. Of course you have all kinds of costs dealing with ownership, but what the IRS says, what it says in the statute, is you are supposed to take the applicable costs from IRS.     And what it has on page 5a is it has something called "ownership costs."       And it defines those as $471.       And then on 3a, where it says what ownership costs are, it says the transportation standards consist of nationwide figures for monthly loan or lease payments, referred to as ownership costs.     So when I read that, I said ownership costs means monthly loan or lease payments, nothing else. Now, you have all kinds of other things. It's just these words "ownership costs" don't refer to those other things, because of that definition given right there.     That's what I thought Justice Ginsburg was initially asking.       And I -- and how -- how do you get out of that what I think of as very, very clear language which says what these standards refer to?       Yes, but it doesn't -- for example, suppose you buy a dozen apples every month, and they cost you $48 extra.     You're not going to say the ownership costs refer to the apples, even if you decorate the car with them. (Laughter.)       I mean, ownership costs refers to lease and loan payments.     Nothing else.       Is there something wrong with the IRS saying what they mean?     It says ownership costs means monthly loan or lease payments.     Now, is there something -       That's what it says it means.     Now, is there something illegal about it defining ownership costs in that way?       What is -- we've got about half the courts in the country agreeing with you.     And so you've read all those arguments, and what in your opinion is the best one on the point, again, where I am stuck, which is Justice Ginsburg's original point?     I mean, I can think of millions of examples.     You have a form that says -- the employer says entertainment expenses.     Then it defines entertainment expenses as food and transport, and they leave out movies, you know. Or you could have vacation expenses, and vacation expenses are defined as transport and hotel, and they leave out meals.     And here we have a definition of ownership expenses, and they say leasing and loaning, and they leave out other forms of ownership.       Now, the argument is, well, that's what they mean by it, so that's what applicable. Now, what's the best argument against that in those cases?     Why is it trying -- why to try to get an expense which isn't loan or lease?     Have you any more right to it than if you tried to get an expense to my totally irrelevant apples?     I mean, it doesn't fit within the applicable definition.     What's the answer?       I've looked at the form.       Yes.       Ownership.       But they -- two pages earlier they say what they mean by the word "ownership."       Yes.       You say half the courts say, oh, you just sort of imagine what ownership expenses are, and anything that they can fall within that general English language word is what they can deduct; is that their approach?     Because we -- you say cut off the definition, cut off the definition from the word "ownership"; don't use it.     So what do we use to define what ownership is?       No, I know, but it's for ownership; it's not for, for example, whistling.     It's for ownership.     So -- so how do we define what that $471 attaches to?     Do we use a State common law definition or something?     How have they done it?       Why?       Why don't we?
09-958 +++$+++ 
09-987 +++$+++        Then is it constitutional if we get a new system?     Here's what the system will be: The taxpayers who are religious will be able to check a box, and the check that they send to the IRS -- it's a possible system -- what happens is that that check is cashed by an official, and the cash is given to the local priest to say prayers for the individual who contributed the money.     And, in your view, there is no one who could challenge that?       The difference is, of course, that in the one case it's a deduction, and in this case you're paying it 100 percent with money that would otherwise go into the coffer.       I understand that.     But I'm interested in, conceptually, does the Government think that there is no one who could challenge that?       So, if you go back into history, it could have been the case that the -- as long as they were fair to every religion, the first Congress could have funded prayers throughout the nation in churches for anyone to go and pray, and that would not have violated the Establishment Clause, or if it had, nobody could have challenged it.       Flast is gone; is that right?     Flast is gone.     There is no more -- nothing more to Flast, because it just happened that nobody had thought of this system at the time of Flast.       If they had, they could have had -- what?       Why?       No, but you don't need be, because all you have to do to get around it is to create what we have here.       Something that worried me in Zelman is this, and I might get your answer. Probably Arizona spends some billions of dollars on public schools, doesn't it?     I don't know what the exact amount is.       Well, let's take 30 or 40 percent of that and spend it through this program on religious schools.     Imagine that happens.     At that point, people might get into considerable discussion about what qualifies, when it doesn't qualify, whether it's a valid school, or is it just teaching religion, and what the rules and regulations are.     How is Arizona dealing with this problem?     By saying there are no regulations, by saying that we're not -- is there a system for dealing with the legitimacy and the circumstances under which a particular religion's schools qualify for this program?     Who decides and how?       Yes.       And that must be a set of regulations and rules.       And when do they teach the religious part of their program?       I mean, when does a private school -- normally the schools -- I mean, I'm not an expert, but what you have to do to be a school is a very complex thing, and you have all kinds of requirements that eat up quite a lot of the day.     And I just wonder how the religion part fits in.     Has there turned out to be no problem?     When do they -- do they teach religion at 6:00 in the morning?     Does it matter if the person's qualified?     How does the -- I once had a case on this in the First Circuit, and it came out to be surprisingly complex, and I just wondered how -- if there turned out to be any problem at all in Arizona in this area.       And you're quite right that in Flast that was the case.     But why isn't it -- given that it's a nexus in Flast, what was in Flast, why isn't it also a nexus where you have this complicated system which is designed to make the ordinary taxpayer pay a little more in this kind of instance, where what you've done is directly subtract from the treasury $5,000 cash to turn over, in the view of the plaintiffs, to a purely forbidden religious purpose?       Was that -- was that in that instance in Flast?     Does Flast rule out the possibility -
09-993 +++$+++        So what are you supposed to do if your company happens by chance to come across a very, very high correlation between people who take your generic drug and who get seriously ill? And now what you know is that nobody else has really found that, but, my goodness, there you are; it happened that it was associated, a special group or something.     What are you supposed to do?       And so are they saying that you -- is it conceded in this case that you did tell the FDA everything you knew about that?       Or is that a point in dispute?       Well, how would it conflict?     Suppose the State said:     Here is what we want; we notice that it says in the Federal law that you must keep your warnings up to date, and if you find an association, you must revise your warning.     Now, we understand you can't do that without FDA approval.     But as far as our State is concerned, we think that when you come across this serious problem you have to tell the FDA in some form or other, a reasonable form, about it. Would that law -- is there anything Federal that that law would conflict with?       What I wonder -- see, I wonder if that's this case.     I wonder if this case is what they're saying is:     Oh, we concede you told the FDA every single thing, so they were just as informed as you are about the risks here, but you did not add the words: And please change our -- your permission, so that we can change the warning.     Is that what this case is about?       When they come up here they might say this isn't just what this case is about.       Yeah.       So your argument is that if we run across this tremendous, really serious -- I can make an imaginary as serious as you want -- really a serious problem, and you're saying the State has no right to say -- even if we purposely didn't tell anybody, they can't get involved because they can't get involved with our failure to tell the FDA anything because that's Federal, and we can't -- they can't get involved with our failure to try to change the warning because that's taken care of by our obligation to tell them, which we didn't fulfill?
09-996 +++$+++        I guess if the situation were such that a lawyer who is representing a client and has to figure out has there been too much delay or not, suppose he looked into the situation thoroughly and he said, gee, I just have no idea, because half the cases come out one way and half of them come out the other way.     Could he then go to the California Supreme Court and say, Court, look what you have been doing?     And would the court then grant a hearing on that and possibly correct it?       All right.     So you're saying there is no such evidence.       That's what I suspected reading this.     But if there were such evidence is there a route in California that they could deal with it?       Yes.       Adequacy of notice, because no notice might be an inadequate notice.       And if it's absolutely divided 50/50, you have no notice.     You don't know what will happen.     And it isn't a rule to say, oh, this is our rule, you don't know what will happen.       I agree with you, we are in hypothetical, never-never land so far.     But it's possible your opponents will convince us it's real land and not never-never land.
10-10 +++$+++        It doesn't -- I'm still curious -- are you finished?
10-1001 +++$+++        I don't understand.     Could you answer the original question that Justice Sotomayor asked?     She said:     What happens in Arizona?     You said a prisoner, or defendant, he has been convicted, gone through his first round of appeal.     He is given a form, which you said is a simple form:     Do you want to proceed in collateral review?     And he answers yes.     Then does Arizona appoint a lawyer or not?       All right.     Then what are we arguing about?     He had his lawyer.       Ah.     So, now you're talking about the second round.     You're talking about does he have a right to a lawyer when he wants to claim that the first lawyer that they gave him on collateral review was ineffective?       What is the issue?       Yes.       All right.     So, why -- that's what I thought, actually.     And I don't understand what all the briefs are about, and I must be missing something, about whether they're all going to have to appoint lawyers or not in these different States.     It seems to me that has nothing to do with this case. This case comes out of a State that does appoint lawyers, and the question is whether you, your client, should have from your point of view at least one full, effective chance to say:     Every lawyer I have been appointed, I've gotten 100, and they are all terrible. And -- or whether the State can block that from being heard in habeas, by saying, oh, no, we gave him 19, and the claim that all 19 were ineffective he can't even raise.     That's the issue; is that it?       No, no, no.     But I'm not -- I'm not ridiculing as it sounded your claim.     I'm saying maybe that's right.     Maybe he's not going to win the claim, probably.     But the question is, if his claim is in Federal habeas, I have gotten 102 lawyers in 102 proceedings and every one of them was absolutely ineffective, perhaps that habeas judge has to look at it and say, oh, I see, he's claiming he's never had one full effective chance to claim that his trial lawyer was ineffective because the other 19 were just as bad.     I have to look at it if I'm a trial judge. Now, that's not a silly argument in my opinion; that could be a winning argument.     I just want to know is that basically your argument?       Okay.       Now let's start at ground zero.     Sorry.     Everyone else -- (Laughter.)       But you can -- you can have a -- you don't have to give him a counsel.     Look, the State did give him a counsel on first collateral review; that counsel was supposed to, according to him, raise the claim my trial counsel was no good. Now we go to the next round.     The State says:     I'm sorry, you are on your own here; we're not giving you a lawyer anymore.     Okay.     That may count.     He now has to know he has to make the argument himself. And, therefore, he goes and makes the argument himself, and now he's in habeas and he can argue they got it all wrong.     He's not blocked.       All right.     So, what -- there isn't an issue in this case about giving people counsel, on that view.     There is an issue about if you do give them counsel, then they have to be able to have an argument later that you did it ineffectively.     That's a different matter; that's a question of whether you're blocked in habeas and can't even make the claim. All right, forget it.     I will ask the other --       Yes, okay.

10-1024 +++$+++       At -- wait -- at common law, if you have a minute. Suppose a plaintiff proved that this particular violation of privacy was so terrible he was 4     in bed for a week, he couldn't go to his family's wedding.    I mean, the absolute -- the clearest possible 6     proof.    Now, would that have been considered general 7     damages or not?    So, it wasn't presumed.    It wasn't 8     speculative.    It wasn't anything.    It's absolute -- tied 9     up.    Definite.      No matter how well proved. 16     No matter how clearly proved.      No matter how clearly they 20     are proved.      And -- and I can look -- to 24     verify that, I look at what definition where?
10-1042 +++$+++        How does this  just -- may be a side issue, but I don't see how this is a fee for service.     I mean, I thought points is simply a way of paying more money up front and getting a lower interest rate later.     It isn't supposed to be for any service; it's simply a question of -- of a loan term, how much you borrow and what the interest rate is.       So, what are we supposed to do -- decide theoretically, in the context of a case that does not involve paying a fee for a service that doesn't exist, whether you can pay for a service that doesn't exist?       How?       What's -- what's the argument on the other side?     A point is a way of paying more money, i.e., borrowing less.     Since you pay more, that means you borrow less.     And so, your interest rate is lower because youve borrowed less.     Now, what's the argument on the other side?       Okay.     How does that work? The bank says to Mr. Smith we are going to charge you $100 for a courier service.     And then they don't.     So, there it is on the bill.     And Mr. Smith, really knowing he didn't get the courier service, pays the $100.     All right?     Why isn't Mr. Smith guilty, on your interpretation? I mean, on your interpretation, every innocent consumer is guilty of a crime.       Why not?       Yes.       So, you -- I don't understand that.     It's my fault.     But wouldn't -- it says that if she doesn't get the appraisal, but she has to pay for it, then why isn't she -- why hasn't -- why doesn't she fall within the statute?       What you got was nothing.       Yes.       Yes.       Why hasn't the consumer violated?       Then why is the bank liable?       I see.     So, this -- you're saying when the bank writes down, "pay $100 for the courier service," the bank is charging for the courier service.       When the consumer pays for the courier service which he sees there, the consumer is not paying for the courier service.     He is paying for the nothing.       All right.     Then why doesn't he fall within the -- within the statute?       Why?       The consumer doesn't violate it in those circumstances because?       Well, can you tell me where in the briefs?     I have to read this about six times to get this one in my head.       Where in the briefs does it explain to me why in your situation the bank would be violating it, but the consumer wouldn't, since it says "no person shall give" as well as "no person shall receive"?       Well, my goodness.     If it isn't in the briefs, it -- maybe I'm off on a track here, but it seems to me a pretty obvious question.       I mean, we have a statute that looks like a kickback statute, and the reason it looks like a kickback statute is it refers both to the person giving and to the persons receiving, and it seems to make them equally liable. Now, you want to apply it to a situation where I don't think you want to hold consumers liable. And so, I think you have to explain to me why this statute doesn't --   -- on your reading of it.       Oh, you mean it's all prosecutorial discretion?     In other words, if you happen to be a consumer you just have to rely on the goodwill of the prosecutor; is that the idea?       What more?       But can you -- I don't want to take all your time on this because to me the more important problem was the problem of the difference between a kickback statute, which we could understand as well within HUD's expertise and normal and of course very good reason for doing it.     But a price control statute, where we have the Federal agency deciding whether the prices are accurate for each service that is rendered or whether some percentage or all of it represents service for nothing -- that's a rather big novelty in American life.     That is, we have it, but they are usually Federal agencies that have a system set up for determining proper prices and so forth. So, it's hard for me to believe that sort of inadvertently Congress brought in the second under the guise of the first without a big fuss being raised and a big debate and so forth.       Yes, but that's the problem.     The problem is, look, you are saying this is a payment for a service that wasn't given.     I think I might say that this is just a lower interest -- a higher interest rate than they -- than they expected. Somebody might say you didn't get the courier service at all.     Others might say you got service but not the gold-plated service, and the gold plate was nothing.     You see, that's what happens when you get into a price control statute rather than a kickback statute.     And that is our concern here, I think at least mine.       Once you say that, you're -- you're outside the reg.     I mean, when you read the reg and the policy statement, it's pretty clear what they are thinking of.       And the policy statement is even clearer.     What they are thinking of is overcharges, period.       No?       It's right here.     It's on -- it's on 53,057.     And what they're explaining is that, and they're talking about a third situation, and they say one settlement service provider charges a fee to a consumer where no work is done, or the fee exceeds the reasonable value of the services performed by that provider.       And so, if it exceeds the reasonable value of the services performed by that provider, you have to say what is the reasonable value of the services performed by that provider.     And that involves the agency in the job of deciding what's a fair or just price for this particular service.       No, but what I'm doing there, you see, is now I'm trying to make sense out of an agency interpretation which is other than what it says, where what they're trying to do is to change the nature of the statute from a kickback statute into a statute that protects consumers across the board from paying for things they don't get.       Now, that's where I'm sort of interested in what the legislative history said, et cetera, et cetera.     It's much more complicated than I thought coming in.     I have to look at a lot of things.       And then part of that is -- you might want to say something about the other part.     I mean, the purpose of this kind of APA/Chevron stuff is to prevent agencies, seeing the supreme importance of their own mission, taking a statute, running with it and in particular transforming into a criminal law something that really wasn't much there. Now, procedure is important in that.     And that's why I'm very interested in whether -- whether they gave notice to the public:     Dear public, we are thinking that this is far more than a kickback statute.       We would like to hear what you think about that.
10-1062 +++$+++        I do, actually, because I see their point better than I did.     This, I think, is what they're worried about:     They're worried that when you get judicial review of this kind of order, the court doesn't refer on factfinding that isn't made on a record.     The substantial evidence test applies to factfinding made on a record, or 556/557.     And so, they'll have a hard time -- or a harder time -- in each of these cases subjecting it to judicial factfinding. And they think that the purpose of this, the purpose of this procedure given to them by statute was to call it -- the shots in favor of them, because there might be thousands of these things, and they can't prepare all that formal thing.     Now, I -- I see that as a -- as a -- now I understand their concern.     I'm not saying they're right.     I understand their concern. So, if you want to comment, is there some way to accommodate their concern that also accommodates judicial review?     Or are we just in a kind of -- they're in a Hobson's choice, in a sense.       They want the power because they have thousands of these things.     They investigate it, and they find the facts.     They think it's sufficient, but judicial factfinding is carried out before a judge who doesn't have their experience, et cetera, and, therefore, there is a risk of incorrect decisionmaking, at least too -- under the statute, it would be too pro-homeowner rather too pro-environment. That's why it's more of a dilemma than I thought.       Well, they might -- the might change their -- their system here, if you -- if you win this, and provide for various kinds of pre-order procedure or post-order procedure where they'd be open to change.     I see a number of possibilities.     I can see their dilemma.
10-1104 +++$+++ 
10-1121 +++$+++        It's peculiar because in the circumstance where the extra assessment is all going to go to chargeable activities, in fact that means economically speaking the following year the objector will be better off, not worse off, because there is a higher percentage of the total fee that's being paid to chargeable activities. So, this special assessment that Justice Sotomayor and the Chief Justice were talking about is one that will benefit the objector, if he keeps quiet and says nothing.     So, it's a little hard to imagine the frame of mind that would say I need the notice because now I might object, whereas I wouldn't have before.       Yes, I see that point.     Can I ask you -- oh, are you -- you want to pursue that further, or are we --       All right.     Let me give you this example.       And now I -- but I think I see what your answer is.     Imagine it's year two.     In year one, expenditures broke down so that it was 70 percent chargeable, 30 percent not chargeable.     Got that?       And normally, under Hudson, that means in year two the deal is the objectors pay 70 percent, right?       In the middle of year two, surprisingly, something comes up.     Something comes up. A surprise to the union, and they want to have a special assessment.     And you're saying they just can't without going through this procedure all over again?       All right.     So, this is a peculiar rule that you have asked us to adopt.     The rule is that where there is a special assessment and it will make all the objectors better off, they have to have a special notice that they can object.     But where the rule is that we're going to take money we already collected from them and spend it for a totally political purpose, we don't give them a special notice and they don't have to object. Now, that seems totally backwards, but I understand why you get there, and my suspicion is -- which you can confirm, is that's the only administrable system you can think of.       Right.     But in my hypothetical --       Yes, but the hypothetical, if I could continue with it, is -- is perhaps unrealistic, but they have 20 bishops and 14 most honest people in the United States, and they've all absolutely guaranteed, and everybody agrees, that this goes to chargeable activity.     And where I was going with my question, which you see where I was -- you're with me on this, right?       And combine the two.     What I'm trying to point out and get your response is that you've been forced into this position to create a workable system.     Now, why is that workable system one whit better than the workable system we already have, which is all this washes out in a fair manner the following year, that there is an inevitable year's lag? It doesn't work perfectly, but it's as good as any other, and all we have to say is it's better than yours. Now, why is yours better than that?       They're useful to me. (Laughter.)       Do you get -- does your Hudson notice tell you about what's going to happen next year?     I thought your Hudson notice told you this was the breakdown for the last year, and as far as we can tell, that's what it will be next year, but -- but things could change.     What does the Hudson notice tell you?       But am I right in my description of it?       All right.       No, but the -- the problem if you win in this case, and then there is this other way of getting to the same -- the same result, is that the other way of getting to the same result, while permissible, is far less transparent.     And people won't understand it, and it -- it encourages a kind of slyness that seems highly undesirable. And the virtue of the present system is that it does require some forced loans, that's true, but it does wash out in the wash, and it ends up being fair to the objectors.     And it's simply hard to think of a better system that doesn't provide more administrative problems than the existing one.       So, that's -- go ahead.
10-114 +++$+++  
10-1150 +++$+++       Yes.    Yes, but your 8     question --      All right.    But then, how 2     do you -- that's -- I see that.    I will spare you the 3     reasons why I think the law of nature doctrine exists, 4     because they are not relevant to my question.      It is also hornbook law 9     that the application of a law of nature can be patented.      All right.    So, in this 12     case, what I think the claim is, is that we are applying 13     a law of nature.    Now, we read the words of applying it      -- at least.    And I want to 23     know what.      -- and I may have spent 13     millions on that.    And I can't patent that law of 14     nature, but I say I didn't; I said apply it.    I said 15     look at his little finger.      Okay?    Is that a good 18     patent or isn't it?      Ah.    Now, we're into the 4     problem.    And that is the problem of how much you have 5     to add.      If you look at the Court's 8     cases, they seem to say Flook, one thing, and Diehr, 9     another thing. And so, what is your view about how much has 11     to be added to make it an application of a law of 12     nature?    And how would you put that in words?      But the -- the words, look, 8     "a simple conventional step."    Hmmm.    You see, whether 9     it's true in this case or not, discovering natural laws      And there's lots of 13     investment to be protected.      And now, that's -- what do 2     you have to add?    And it can't be that you take the law 3     of nature out and look to whether the rest of it meets 4     the patent criteria.    It's -- it's pretty clear in the 5     law, and I can give you reasons why, but forget the 6     reasons. But, look, what do you want to say the rest 8     of it has to add up to?      But it's pretty easy to 18     think of the same problem you have, you know, which 19     doesn't have this infinity in it.      Which unfortunately we have 22     to deal with.      Why isn't that an application of the law of nature?    And if you look to 22     LabCorp's dissent to find an answer to that question, 23     you're better than I, because I couldn't find it.
10-1195 +++$+++       All right.    So, the basic 16     reason seemed to me that it might mean "may," and I'm 17     following up on the Chief Justice here, who withdrew 18     this interesting part of his question.    The -- the 19     Congress seemed to want to have ordinary people be able 20     to go into small claims court in a State and bring an 21     action for $500 because they were pestered by these 22     salesmen on the phone in violation of the Act. Now, if you're right, they could go into 24     Federal court.    But so could the defense.    And so, any 25     case they bring in small claims court, I guess, could be removed, couldn't it?    And how is that -- am I right 2     about that?      Well --      Well, why wouldn't they -- 8     I mean, you know, if they're really pests -- I'm not 9     saying they're all pests; some might be.    But if they're 10     pests and they want to drag it out, what they do is they 11     just remove it from small claims court.    They tell their 12     lawyer      Oh, it's not self-defeating, because we keep it up, and the word will 3     get around.      And in case, by the way, 6     anyone doubts it, before he even files it -- one of the 7     things that we'll instruct our salesmen to say is      All right.      But is there any reason to 3     think before you brought this suit that people thought 4     they could remove it to Federal court?      All right.    Aside from the 23     individual ones, what's actually worrying me, which I've 24     tried to bring out, is I'm pretty certain Congress in 25     this statute was trying to protect the average person who can't afford a lawyer who is pestered with these 2     calls.    That's their object.      And, therefore, I think, 7     gee, I'm not so sure about this.    They don't gain much 8     advantage, the plaintiffs, by being able to go into 9     Federal court, and there could be some advantage on the 10     defense side to making things more complex, raising 11     legal fees.    Okay? So, that's where I am at this moment.    Now, 13     I'm asking you this because I would like your best 14     answer to disabuse me of this notion which cuts against 15     your case.      What happens --
10-1211 +++$+++ 
10-1219 +++$+++        There has to be a reasonable -- some kind of justification.     Can you work with the word "equitable"?     I mean, this was an equitable action, and could you say that the -- to the district court, well, of course, you -- assuming you'd win on the second question.     But on the first question, this is not an on/off thing.     That's your real objection to the de novo standard. You say:     But these are equitable actions, and generally an individual should not be allowed to run around the PTO.     So, you better have some kind of reason, but leave it up to the -- to the district courts to work with that word "equitable" and to -- it seems to me there will be a lot of shading cases here where you can't quite tell if it is new or isn't new and some parts are and some aren't.     But just leave it up to the district court and say:     Take into account the fact that people should not be allowed to run around the PTO and work equity.     That's kicking the ball back. Now, if you like that, let me know.     If you don't like it, tell me what we -- why -- what should we -- you want an absolute rule?     Tell me why.       And if it says there isn't, then it can't hear it?     I mean, imagine you're sitting there as a district judge, you think:     Oh, my God, they should have presented it, but this is the key matter forever.     Do I really pay no attention to it at all?       Except you have a history here.       You have the history of the pre-APA section 145 where they apparently did take the evidence in.
10-1259 +++$+++        What -- what is the question that I think people are driving at, at least as I understand them and certainly share the concern, is that if you win this case, then there is nothing to prevent the police or the government from monitoring 24 hours a day the public movement of every citizen of the United States.     And -- and the difference between the monitoring and what happened in the past is memories are fallible; computers aren't. And no one, or at least very rarely, sends human beings to follow people 24 hours a day.     That occasionally happens.     But with the machines, you can. So, if you win, you suddenly produce what sounds like 1984 from their brief.     I understand they have an interest in perhaps dramatizing that, but -- but maybe overly.     But it still sounds like it. And so, what protection is there, if any, once we accept your view of the case, from this slight futuristic scenario that's just been painted and is done more so in their briefs?       Of course, that's true. And they do have a limit.     In this case, they say Knotts involved a single journey, or let's say it involved four journeys.     And let's say it involved four journeys in 2 days.     This involves every journey for a month.     So, they say whatever the line is that's going to protect us, it's short of every journey in a month. So, I'm not asking -- I'm saying I accept your point there.     And what do you say is the limit?       Well, there is the same kind of guidance that you have in any case of this Court that uses the technique which is used sometimes, and I think it's used for example in the bribing the judge case, you know, with campaign contributions.     You draw an outer limit, you say you can't go beyond that.     We know within that, there is no standard.     We'll leave it for the lower courts to work out, and we'll review it over time. That's not necessarily desirable, but that is a method this Court has sometimes used.       But even if it's wrong, I want to know, are you saying there is no limit or are you suggesting one?       But they won't -- they won't and probably couldn't physically. Start with the other end.     Start -- what would a democratic society look like if a large number of people did think that the government was tracking their every movement over long periods of time.     And once you reject that, you have to have a reason under the Fourth Amendment and a principle.     And what I'm looking for is the reason and the principle that would reject that, but wouldn't also reject 24 hours a day for 28 days.       Do you see where I'm -- and that's what I'm listening very hard to find.
10-1261 +++$+++ 
10-1265 +++$+++       If it doesn't have a fixed 13     meaning.    I mean, wouldn't you think -- I suspect the 14     answer is you do think that -- a district judge has a 15     lot of power in many, many areas, and in one of those 16     areas, some district judge sometime could make a 17     horrendous mistake that really wrecks a case, and in 18     such a matter, the court of appeals, if it sees a really 19     horrendous error, will probably have the authority to 20     say you went beyond whatever standard applies, at least 21     here, at least -- okay, we agree on that one. So, they use some words, "effectiveness," 23     whatever the words are, "interest of justice," just to 24     reflect that fact.    I mean, that's what I think what 25     happened.    Then your complaint is he didn't abuse his -- he didn't really abuse anything; he made a good 2     decision, the district judge.    Isn't that what that 3     comes down to?      What's important?      And they applied it in 17     circumstances that you think -- the district judge was 18     actually -- his decision was fine.    You don't have the 19     power to set that aside because it was within -- it's 20     within the scope of any kind of standard you want to 21     call it, including calling it "interests of justice." 22     Am I right in thinking that, that that's really your 23     concern?      All right.    So, what you 5     really want us to do is to look at the record of the 6     case, go through it, and say, here, whatever words you're going to use, the district court acted within his 8     discretion in saying don't change the counsel.    Is that 9     what you -- is that what I'm supposed to do?    I'm trying to get at what you want me to do.      I didn't mean literally 22     "whatever words you use."      I'm trying to figure out 25     what you want me to do.    One is to go back and search all the cases that use some words for a standard, which, 2     as you can tell, I'm reluctant to think that that's 3     meaningful in this case. The other is to look at the record to see if 5     he acted within what you would normally think of as the 6     district court's discretionary authority.
10-1293 +++$+++        Could you -- could you digress for one minute to help me understand the procedural posture of this case.     When it was here last time, we were dealing with an issue called "fleeting expletives," and that was Fox.     And the Fox case involved just that.     They didn't really, or we didn't, or the Court didn't, attack the 2001 order which is now at issue.     And then, without it going back to the commission, the Second Circuit decided it on a ground that sets aside the 2001 order. Now, can we here just decide the fleeting expletive case, because the fleeting expletive case has to do with one subset of applications of the 2001 order and has to do with part 2(2) or something.     I mean, it has -- and how you interpret the words "material dwells on or repeats."     Now, that I -- that I understand how to get at. The ABC case raises -- doesn't raise fleeting expletives.     It wasn't fleeting.     And it raises the question of the validity of -- under vagueness grounds, of 2001 industry guidance and how that's been applied.     But the Second Circuit didn't deal with that case.     It sent it back to the commission. So, has there been a commission decision recently which has reviewed the basic arguments being made here about the validity of the 2001 industry guidance as applied?     Has there been such a thing? Alternatively, has there been an appeals court holding on the -- or analysis of the ABC case?       Right.       But they didn't -- they didn't in that case --       -- and they sent the ABC case back.     I see your --       Yes.       I see.       All right.     When this ABC case was argued in front of the commission -- I have here about 30 briefs at least, maybe 40, and they are filled with very good arguments.     Were those arguments made to the commission in the context of the ABC case? Because as it comes up here, we are -- whereas I thought when we granted cert, quite honestly, that this was Fox coming back, as I've read the brief it isn't at all. This is a new case, nothing to do with what we decided before.     This is the case of ABC, period.     And it is an attack on the 2001 guidelines, not fleeting expletives. And, therefore, I want to know, at least satisfy myself, that this Fox -- this ABC case has gone through ordinary procedures and, indeed, these arguments have all been made in front of the commission and they've been rejected.       I'm not saying every one, but has the essence of these arguments.
10-1320 +++$+++        What's bothering me is I can't figure this out very well.     We have an imaginary State, and what the State says to the jury:     Jury, you have three choices.     Choice one is you acquit this person of everything.     Choice two is you convict him of something.     Choice three is you say you're hung.     Okay? I don't see anything in the Constitution that prevents a State from doing that.     So, if that -- if no -- what is it?     And, of course, if you follow that, there was no acquittal on those early charges. That wasn't a permissible verdict.     And now you structure your argument any way you want, but that the State has -- I would think, within the limits of due process, it can structure the jury's arguments as it wishes. But -- so, what's wrong with that?     And if that -- if there's nothing wrong with that, then how do you win?       Well, you could say, well, you could -- well, that's one route.     What you say is nothing wrong with that.     But if the judge is foolish enough to get the jury -- to get the foreperson to say what the state of the deliberation is in detail, then the Double Jeopardy Clause kicks in.     Well, that's an argument.       So, they make a mistake and now suddenly its jeopardy where it wasn't before, or -- this seems like a minor matter compared to the issues of jeopardy, whether the jury honestly said what was going on in the room, particularly if it's changeable.       Okay.     So, let's -- go ahead.       Please.       Why "surely"?       I mean, why "surely"? Look, the thing ends.     To go back to my example, the case is over, the jury comes in and says, Judge, we're hung.     Okay?     Everybody is going to go home.       But the defense lawyer says, Judge, I'd like to know which of the five charges they're on.     Does the defense lawyer or the prosecutor have a constitutional right to find out?       No, I'm not assuming anything.     Im giving you the example.       Yes.       What's the answer?       In the State I imagine is -- remember, there were three possible verdicts: Acquit of everything, convict of something, or say you're hung.     That's what we're imagining.     Okay?     And you can imagine the set of instructions -- go to A, B, C.   That's fair enough.    Those four things.       Okay?     Now, case over, acquitted -- no, hung, Your Honor. Defense attorney:     I want to find out which of the five they're on. Does he have a constitutional right to get the answer?       He does?       I don't know what -- I'm sorry.       Okay.     Okay.     I see, okay, fine.       In other words, here -- I got it.     If --       Okay.     Okay.       Wait.     I'm only midway, because I'm trying to follow this through.     I still don't know why the Constitution does that, but I'll take your word for it.     I'd assume it was State law that does that, but -- but fine. Now he says, yes, you have the right, either of you has the right. We're on number three. Your Honor, I would like a poll of the jury as to the acquittal as to one and two. Does both -- do both sides have the right to get that?       No.     Well, here's what happened:     Judge, I want to know what number they were on when they couldn't reach a --       Foreman Honor. Judge, I would like a poll of the jury, each juror, as to numbers one, two, three, and four to be sure that they were unanimous on each as to the acquittal, which under the instruction allowed them to go to the next one. Okay?     Constitution requires it?       No, no.     Why doesn't the Constitution require it?     You have to be sure there was an acquittal.     You have to be sure there was an acquittal.     And what -- what I'm doing obviously is I'm spinning out what I see as the constitutional consequences of taking your constitutional position, and I'm going to be ending up by saying I've never heard of this before.       But there's a lot of stuff I haven't heard of.     So, that doesn't prove that much. (Laughter.)
10-1399 +++$+++        Would you then go back -- I did have the same question Justice Alito asked, and I'd like to hear the answer.     The answer -- that there -- I'll add one footnote, perhaps, which -- make it a more complete answer, and that is that it makes very little sense to me when a worker becomes disabled on January 1, 1990, for example.     He is now disabled.     And so, we calculate what his wage was.     His wage was $200 a week. And now we say:     But that shouldn't exceed twice the average weekly wage, and we're not going to apply it to him. You're going to apply it to him at some random date.     His wage that he's getting paid is figured out as of January 1, 1990.       But the maximum that it could be is figured out as of January 1, 1998, when he finishes a proceeding. Now, I just -- for both reasons, why would you distinguish and why would you get that result?     For those two reasons, it doesn't seem to make much sense to me, your reading of it, while theirs does make sense. Now, you explain why that is.       But you think -- you think it is not stupid because you think it is a good idea to give a lot of work to the Department of Labor and that all the employers who are going to do this voluntarily and there will never be a problem with it -- all should be encouraged to go and get a certificate from the Department of Labor.     All right.     I'll take that as -- something. And now, why is it I can't read the statute the way that it seems to make somewhat more sense?     I don't see any words here that stop me from reading it.       Where now there exactly? It says -- you mean in (c)?       You just told me that just has to do with permanent or total disability, and this is far --       But why -- why don't they both?     I mean, as I read it naturally, it says that -- we now have a special thing, you know, which these people are the dead ones and the widows are getting it and the permanently disabled people, and the -- this individual, and the Secretary, the Secretary or his delegate is going to calculate this thing all the time. And they've got a special thing here for -- for permanent people, permanently disabled, and they're saying as to those people, we're giving them a break. They can't look for more work.     They can't look for -- they're dead, for example, and they can't find other sources of income.     And so, we say that, that if the average wage goes up and their wage was higher to begin with, we will raise it a bit.       And that applies not only to the people who are just getting this for the first time in the relevant period; it also applies to all those who have been getting it.     It applies to both groups.     Well, that makes sense to me.       Yes.     Right.       Right.       So, the whole thing applies just to the permanently disabled and the death things. What says it applies to anybody else?       The whole thing.     The whole -- the whole -- all of (c).     That's -- in my thing here, that's seven lines.     All of (c) applies to permanently disabled and those who died.       Oh, yes.     Oh.       I feel slightly like an Abbott and Costello movie, but I'm getting this -- (Laughter.)       I see.     Is your argument this now -- I'm sorry to be so slow.     But that, look, there is a statute here; it that says compensation cannot exceed more than 200 percent of the annual weekly -- or the weekly wage.     Then in (3), it says how to calculate that particular number.     And then you go over to (c), and (c) says that calculated number applies to those newly awarded compensation. And you're saying "newly awarded compensation" means somebody got it through an award, not somebody got it automatically.     And since somebody got it -- had to get it through an award or it wouldn't apply when you just get it because they pay for it, it just doesn't apply.     You have to go get the award.     And the word you're turning on is "newly awarded."       That's the argument?       I was -- I was --       Now I fully understand your argument.
10-1472 +++$+++        There are -- there are lots of regions of the country -- Puerto Rico, for example -- where there are vast numbers of documents that have to be translated if you go into Federal court, not necessarily in the Commonwealth courts.     That's expensive to people.     And they might have thought for a long time, while that expense won't go away, it's at least better to have it paid by the loser than to have it paid by the winner. That's been the common practice.     I don't think that's a foolish approach.     And you can find language in this, which is to go back -- go back to Justice Sotomayor.       What do you think of the -- I mean, the First Circuit went into this, which deals a lot with Puerto Rico, and it felt that this fell within the idea of fees for exemplification, which is certifying a document.     And, in fact, to certify a document that comes into the Federal court in San Juan, you have to have it translated very often.     And so, the translation cost is at least consistent with the idea there of trying to -- well, you may -- you don't have to -- you may impose the cost on the loser.       Why haven't the -- I was interested here that the amici on your side consist of some professors and the -- I guess the trade association of interpreters or translators, but the people who would have the financial stake in it, the defense bar, the plaintiffs' bar in some circumstances, have not filed any brief.     And I tend, though not putting a lot of weight on it, to take it as a sign, along with the long period of time, that there hasn't been some tremendous financial problem.     What evidence is there that there has been?     I -- a few cases, but in general.       There's a plain language argument I got.     But how many years has the great bulk of the court been going the other way?       How many years has, would you say, the great bulk of the Federal system been deciding this differently from the way you think it should be?       That's the bulk.       Well, when did all this rot set in, in your opinion?     How long?       What's the first one?       You have a case cited from 1812.     I take it that's it.
10-1491 +++$+++        You went -- can I go back to -- are you finished with that answer?     Because I want you to finish.       I just want some clarification on the first question that Justice Kennedy asked.     Well -- I'll get it in reading about it.     You go ahead.     You want to reserve your time.     I can find the answer --       -- to what I was going to ask.       So, I -- I think this is unnecessarily complicated.     They made a -- a categorical rule.     They said never sue a corporation.     I seem to think possibly of counterexamples.     Pirates, Incorporated.       You know?     I mean -- so -- so, why isn't that -- why are we going into -- I mean, you have good reason for doing it, and I want to hear why.
10-1542 +++$+++        So, how does it work?     I'm -- how does it work?     Two legal permanent residents, a man and his wife, happen to show up in New York, and they have a 6-month-old child.     All right.     What's the legal -- why doesn't the INS just take the child, ship him off?     I mean there -- is it just discretion?     Or is there some rule of law or regulation that prevents that from happening?       Well, no.     I've given you the hypothetical.     I mean, there we are.       That's all you know.       I'm not asking for that. I'm saying, what in the law -- that's all you know.     All right?     There are -- you know the hypothetical. I want -- one possible thing to say would be that child is -- is actually -- we are imputing that he's here for lawful permanent residence, too.     Every circuit had had some kind of imputation rule, and moreover there are other areas of law where I have found imputation rules in the immigration law.     Roughly, I have three or four cases on that.     But they're -- they're not exactly comparable. Okay.     So, I just want to know what is it that prevents you from taking the child and shipping him off to China if we don't impute?       I'm not asking that.     You know the question.     I just want your best effort --       -- to give an answer.     Or I'm thinking that your answer is there is nothing; it's either imputation or nothing.       And you don't want me to reach that conclusion.       No, no.     That isn't my hypothetical. (Laughter.)       Actually they came from Italy, in my hypothetical. (Laughter.)       I don't see how -- were you finished?       I don't see how the -- you can read the Lepe-Guitron -- that was one of the cases -- it seems to me clearly imputes residence as well. They quote the earlier case from the circuit which said the 7 years of domicile have to come after their admission for permanent residence.     And then the dissent says, hey, what about permanent residents?     And what they say is this case is different because, in that earlier case, the parents had never been admitted.     He came after he was married in this case.     He's here after his parents were admitted.     Now, I grant you they didn't explicitly say this, but I don't see how they reached their conclusion without it. And then there's a different split in the circuits about the pro and con of tacking on periods, you know, before the domicile, after, et cetera.     And that seems to be what Congress resolved. So, I think if you're talking about what was the law, the law was you did impute with -- you did impute for residence.     And then Congress sort of just doesn't deal with that and deals with a slightly different thing.     Is that a fair reading, or what do you think?
10-174 +++$+++ 
10-179 +++$+++        Well, but his basic argument I think is that in Marathon -       Make it totally fair. Nobody is being treated unfairly.     Structurally, it does injure the -- the prestige or something or the structure or the integrity of the Federal Government -- judiciary, Federal judiciary -- to allow the bankruptcy judge to adjudicate a direct claim; why is a counterclaim different?
10-188 +++$+++ 
10-209 +++$+++        Well, you --     first, there's nothing about this in the Sixth Amendment, is there?     I mean, the text of the Sixth Amendment talks about criminal prosecutions requiring the assistance of counsel for defense, period.       Okay.     So, there's nothing in the Sixth Amendment that has these qualifications.     I haven't seen anything in any case which was other than case specific.     That is, this issue hasn't been decided before, not to my knowledge.     The language can be taken out of those cases, as you've very properly done.     And so, there's nothing that I could find in the cases. Nothing in the Sixth Amendment itself.     In 95 percent of the cases, they do plead guilty.     And what's the problem about ordering the prosecution to simply repeat the offer he gave before? Well, I mean, I don't really see if there -- and prejudice?     What if a person's been executed?     If he had gotten the -- if he had gotten the plea offer, he would have pled guilty for 50 years in jail, okay? That's my imaginary case.     I can think of one where there's prejudice.     He's dead.     All right?     So, what's the answer in my imaginary case, if it's not in the amendment, not in -- not a holding, et cetera?       I don't want to -- I want to stop you there because I don't understand it.     The suggestion is -- I'm not taking this case; I'm making up a hypothetical since we're discussing it really based on the next case.     The defendant never heard the offer, never heard it.     It is crystal clear that if he'd heard it, he would have accepted it.     Okay?     I'm trying to separate out difficulties of this case, which strikes me as difficult because of the facts, from the principle. And what I want you to do is to tell me why I shouldn't accept the principle, and then we can worry about what's a clear case.       Death.     Let's say death.       He shows that never did he ever become aware, because his lawyer was sleeping and moved on vacation and never told him about the plea offer.     That's my hypothetical.       All right.     If you don't want to do the capital case?     I'm still trying to get to the principle.       I'll change my hypothetical and say all that happened was that this perfect trial, because of mandatory sentencing rules, led him to prison for 50 years, as compared with a plea bargain which would have given him 2 years.     Now, he is in prison for 48 years more, and I consider that that's at least harmful to him.     So, where the amendment doesn't speak of it, where the misbehavior of the lawyer is crystal clear, where it's 48 years more in prison, what is it that bars what seems to me obvious that an inadequate assistance of counsel, remedial through a specific decree saying reinstitute the offer, led to enormous unfairness and prejudice?       The lists are legion where people don't get the sentence that they deserve because, for example, the lawyer was inadequate.     I mean --
10-218 +++$+++       You can't lift a boat over 23     Niagara Falls.    And I -- and I read somewhere that -- I 24     hope I'm wrong, but I have a feeling I read somewhere 25     that the land under Niagara Falls has long been considered to be navigable, and, therefore, it's owned 2     by the United States.      The navigable ones are 12     owned by the State.    Okay.    Everybody's thought the land 13     under Niagara Falls is owned by the State.    Oh, dear, 14     because that sort of wrecks our nice theory that all the 15     steps, all the little bits of it that are non -- that 16     are --      Okay.    Now we have to 21     define what's an extended strip.      Okay.    So, how much are we 5     wrecking if we just say, look, the bit that's      A quick question which you 17     could probably answer just by saying we decided not to. 18     But I was somewhat curious.    It's really the United 19     States v. Montana in this, who owns the land, and it's a 20     question of Federal law.    It's going to be highly 21     factual no matter what this happens.    Made for this 22     Court's original jurisdiction.    And -- and normally in 23     original jurisdiction, we appoint a master, it's worked 24     out, and we review the master's report. We can't do that here because it's a case -- why didn't you go into, or why couldn't you go into, a 2     quiet title action in Federal court?
10-224 +++$+++        What am I supposed to do -- I have a quick procedural question, which I think is similar to Justice Ginsburg's.     Suppose this is three sections, the State law, and some of them have three parts.     Suppose I thought, well, the word "buy" -- I mean, "buy" might cover an awful lot of things that don't have much to do with operations.     Maybe sometimes they do.     Suppose I ended up thinking that, but I thought you were right about all the rest of it.     What am I supposed to do?       No, no, no.     I'm just doing that hypothetically.       Yes.       But what I discover is there are at least 11 different provisions in this, and I have exactly Justice Scalia's question.     Do we have to write an 11-part opinion where we treat each of these different things, which are different, separately and analyze it?     I'm not trying to get out of the work.     I just want to know. (Laughter.)       Suppose we agree with you about that.     We say, if I agree with you about that, there we are; you're supposed to pick up this animal which is on the slaughterhouse floor and kill it right away.     That seems to have to do with operations.     All the rest of these other 10 provisions are just variations on that theme, according to the Government, and we send it back for them to argue this out below.       Well, there are 10 other parts.     There are 10 other parts.
10-235 +++$+++        Is there a case like that?       Yes, but I mean somebody might think that having to go off and patrol a thing in a rough area is something that happens with a sudden stop:     You run a risk of turning your leg. I agree with you about the snake.     Is there any case about the snake?       Okay.     So the furthest - the furthest -- the furthest that you go is the case of sudden stop in the wilderness, gets off, rough area, and twists his ankle.       I don't know.     Is that proximate cause or not?     Maybe it isn't.       But there has been no such case, to your knowledge?   How about eggshell skull? That is a different kind of It is not foreseeable.  You're just saying, it's all foreseeable, not foreseeable.
10-238 +++$+++        Can you -- can you tell me on that, because I take it you agree with Justice Ginsburg about Buckley.     In Buckley the Court says, public financing is a means of eliminating the improper influence of large private corporations, furthers a significant government interest. We both agree that's what it says?       I take it that's what it means.     All right. Now, your objection is how much do they pay.       Here they have a trigger, not -- not quantitatively.     But here they say it's okay to finance a public candidate publicly, okay to do that. Now, what we're going to do is give them a million dollars to start with, up to $3 million to spend, depending on how much their opponents spend.     Now, you think that's unconstitutional? My question to you is, what would be a constitutional system in your opinion?       That would be helpful.       I'm not interested in Buckley.     I'm interested in your opinion.     You object to the amount being paid in installments.     What, in your opinion, would be a constitutional system?     I don't need to repeat my question, which I just did, but I want that answer, your answer to that.       Do you think that if Joe Smith doesn't have much money, takes public finance at all, that that could discourage some other people, Brown and Johnson, from running?       No, there's not -- it's not going to -- it's not going to be a situation where government paying a million dollars to Smith to help him in the campaign would discourage some other person from running?       If we -- if we say, you can file a brief and if you do, other people can file, is that my -- forget the briefs.     It's too farfetched. (Laughter.)       I did -- I did think you would give the other answer, to tell you the truth, because I just don't see why giving somebody a million dollars might not discourage a -- a poorer candidate from running.       No, no.     Joe, the guy who wants it, it's voluntary for him; but his opponents can't do anything about that. I'm just saying Joe takes the money, so Brown and Smith say:     Oh my God, he has a million dollars, forget it.     I'll stay home.     I won't run.       And you say that just doesn't happen?       Never happens?     Okay.       And I gather that people who have looked into the Arizona scheme also say what you think will happen never happens, either.       So should we look at both instances?
10-277 +++$+++        If you just spend one second, remember my question.     We've got a common issue. Why isn't that enough at least to support a (b)(2) injunctive action?       That sounds like the merits you're getting to.     His point, remember, is this is just certification.     So, my question is:     Assuming they can support it with evidence, why can't they have their (b)(2) class, at least on an injunctive relief?
10-290 +++$+++        I have one question here I would like to get your view on.     I'll assume that the language is open enough in the history so that we could make what would be a change, I think it would be a change.     The reasons as I get from the brief for doing that are because there are two types of errors:     It's a bad thing not to give protection to an invention that deserves it; and it is just as bad a thing to give protection to an invention that doesn't deserve it. Both can seriously harm the economy. And you are also saying that the Patent Office is out of control, not through its own fault, but there are too few people and too many inventions.     And therefore type two error is a real risk. So I'm turning you to and say:     Well, what should we do about it?     I know your proposal.     But we have also seen in these briefs the following proposal: One, somebody who thinks there is a type two error, go back to the Patent Office and ask for reconsideration. That's pretty good.     We get the experts to look at it again. And then that's coupled with:     Tell the district judges to stick very closely to their job, allow the clear and convincing standard to apply to facts, and by that we mean brute facts, and let them decide the brute facts, but let the judge decide whether that amounts to obviousness, novelty, or any of the other prerequisites. Now, I've gotten that out of the amicus briefs, some of which say they support you but they really don't.     So I would like -- I would like your views on those two suggestions as being sufficient to cure the problem that you point to.       I'm getting that out of the American Intellectual Property Law Association.     I don't blame them for my phrasing of it, but that is what struck the thought in my mind that careful instructions limiting the juries to brute facts and giving the judge the notion, the job of characterizing that -- you heard what I said -- that that will go a long way towards curing the problem you're worried about.       It might not in your situation.     But the problem is in principle as it's put to us that the office and the Federal Circuit emerge giving protection to things that aren't really novel, that aren't really advances on the prior art, et cetera. Now, if that's the problem, and you carefully instruct the jury, the bad fake patents will go away because the judge will say:     Look, this metal case called a battery leakproof is not really novel.       No, no.     The judge says want you to find if this metal container is leak proof. Jury:     Yes.     Now it's up to the judge.       What about the rule where -- I'm trying this on, I don't buy it necessarily -- the -- the heightened standard exists where the Patent Office did consider it or could have considered it had the infringer asked for reconsideration? In other words, put the burden on the infringing party to use this procedure, and if he does use it, it's going to get a heightened burden if he loses -       And if he doesn't use it, it should get a heightened burden because he should have used it.       The statute itself doesn't -- we're all going on history here, I mean, and history brought up to date with the words of the statute I don't think cover it either way.     They talk about presumption, but put that to the side.       I wanted your opinion on that as the validity or a useful instruction for juries.       I'm not asking that question.     I'm asking the question of whether in your experience as a patent lawyer or -- would -- what we're trying to do is we're trying to get a better tool, if possible, to separate the sheep from the goats.     That's what we're after, I think, and so what is that better tool?
10-313 +++$+++        Where would I read this? As I read the statute, the statute says the cheap system here is where they provide -- they have a duty to provide the incumbent interconnection, okay?     That requires some physical stuff.       Okay.     And they have to -- they -- you have to -- you're not charged a lot for that; there's a limit on what they can charge you for the interconnection.       Now, somebody is going to have to decide whether if Pacific Tel and Tel is being tried to forced to connect with Maine, you know, they have to pay for a wire across country to get the interconnection or not.     That seems unreasonable. Across the street, maybe they do. My candidate would normally be the FCC or some regulator decides that kind of thing, and it's up to them to say whether this is or is not what's needed for interconnection.     That would be an intuitive account I would have, without having read the statute in depth. So, now what do I read to find out how this works?     What is it that distinguishes something that is ridiculous, like my California example, from something that makes a lot of sense, like they're next door and have to make 50 feet of wire.       Michigan blue --       Where -- where -- 28a, okay.       Okay.     So, it's up to the State commission.       This is the FCC speaking?       All right.     And the State commission says -- they say it's up to the State commission.     And the State commission here said?       Do you read --       Can I go back to my question?     Because I haven't gotten an answer.       You see, I would think -- you said, well, this is an existing facility.       But my intuition would be that makes no difference whatsoever.     You could have some kind of mechanism that connects two companies. Now, half of it is a simple wire and half of it is bells and whistles.     And so, we have to decide which part is the part that's necessary for the interconnection and which part is some kind of -- well, I don't know, extra bells and whistles, and therefore, since it's not an impairment kind of problem, they have to pay full price for it. That, again, seems like the kind of job that Congress would leave up to a commission, but I guess I want you to tell me:     Who's to decide that kind of thing, and how do we decide it?       I don't know what it is. Often, these things are not distance.     Often, a connection is all kinds of complex things, you know? And some are necessary and some aren't.     But I can -- can't you imagine with me the same kind of California problem arising, but it just arises in -- in kind, rather than in distance?       My -- if I'm so far off base you can't get the question, forget it.       I mean, I might not be able to get an answer.       You don't have to think it's that.       Where do I find that?       So, what's the definition difference between entrance facility and interconnection facility?     How do we know which is which?       No, no, I'm not.     I want to know what's the difference.     Tell me in English what the difference is.       No, no.     I mean, how do we know which is which?     We see some big lines and stuff in it; how do we know which is which?
10-382 +++$+++        Suppose we have the Union Trust Company, a private company that has 5,000 trust accounts.     One day the president of the company says to the lawyer:     Mr. Smith's account is in a special situation.     Will you please look into what we should do for him as trustee?     There's no implication for any other account.     There's no threat of litigation.     I just want to know what we're supposed to do.     Now, I take it the document that is subsequently written would be open for Mr. Smith to get; is that right?       Yes, okay.     Now, why should the government be treated differently were the situation identical to what I just proposed?       I would like to get an answer to my question.       My question, to go back to it, was imagine that the government has a thousand trust accounts for a thousand tribes.       And imagine that several of them consist of nothing more than $500,000 in cash.       And one day the Secretary of the Interior says to a lawyer:     I fear there is kind of a difficult fiduciary problem arising into account number 302, which is owned by such and such tribe. There is no threat of litigation.     As far as I can tell, the answer to this will have no implication for anything else in the government.     Will you please look at it and give me a memo what to do? Now, why should that memo not be given to the lawyer for the tribe if in the identical case of the Union Trust Company you would give the lawyer -- the memo to the beneficiary?       You're saying, one, we're not really a trustee totally?       Okay.     Now, if we treated -- the courts treated you as a trustee really and totally -       -- in this very limited situation I described, what harm would befall the government?
10-444 +++$+++        I mean, aren't we taking this on -- isn't there an assumption that there's a finding, or some lower court judge made a finding that if he had known about the better deal that was offered, he would have taken it?       Yes.       Well, then that's a causal problem.     You're saying that, even if he had accepted it, it would have gone to the judge, and the judge would have turned it down anyway.     The judge wouldn't have accepted it.       Is that your point?       Well, then there's a -- somebody must have found somewhere that this made a difference.       That the failure to tell him about the special offer of the misdemeanor did in fact make a difference because he would have accepted it and he would have ended up with it.       Yes.       This is on the basic question --       Well, the -- the question -- I make a counter-assumption.     The problem that I -- I have the feeling that I'd like you and the others to comment on, is that you're worried deeply about a practical problem, and that the practical problem is that it would be too easy, as just was suggested by the question, to find that the lawyer, after the defendant is convicted, did a bad job during the plea negotiation, in which case everybody will get two or three bites at the apple.     And one of the reasons for that is every brief has been lifting the standards, particularly in respect to prejudice, from Hill, which was addressing a different question.     It was addressing the question of missed -- bad performance by the lawyer at trial.     And that's hard to track what the effects are, and it isn't that hard to say the trial was unfair, give him a new one. That won't work here, I don't think.     So suppose what we did, instead of saying there was no right, you simply said you have to prove with some certainty, work out a standard, that there really was inadequate assistance during the plea bargaining, and you have to show something more than a reasonable probability that this would have led to the plea, et cetera.     You have to show that it would have happened. Or you have a -- in other words, you have two tougher standards for this area, but you don't reject the idea of inadequate assistance of counsel during the plea bargaining stage.     I'd like people's views, insofar as they are willing to give them, on that question.

10-5258 +++$+++  
10-5400 +++$+++ 
10-5443 +++$+++        That's what I wondered. You haven't really argued that, so maybe I'm missing something, and this question may be better for the other side, but this statute, as you go through it, has some elements. The first are facts about the world, killing people; the second has to do with intent, and then they talk about all these different things to stop him from going to a Federal officer; the third says no state of mind need be proved with respect to the fact he works for the Feds.     So, therefore, it's not part of intent. Now, if it's a circumstance that is an element of the offense and it is not part of the intent of the defendant, then isn't it an element, like all other elements, that you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt?       You didn't argue it, so nobody's ever adopted this, so I feel I might be barking up the wrong tree.     Now, I grant you, you're not the leaf on the tree that's going to give me the answer I need, which is why I'm wrong, but -- but did you - you've researched this and haven't really argued this point.     So, why not?       I take it you were not the trial lawyer?       Oh, you were? (Laughter.)       Anyway, you've made a fine argument here, even if you didn't make it - (Laughter.)       I'm slightly regretting bringing that up.       You agree basically on the point?       I think where you have - where somebody tries to prevent a general thing, we normally say you also prevent -- tries to prevent those things that are specific that fall within the general term, but not every oddball example.       And what you want is something that rules out the oddball examples.     And your words are "reasonable likelihood," and you'll say if it's an oddball example, you can't hold him guilty of that, if it turns out that in this case the Federal example is an oddball example. My question really is to you:     If you win on that, then are you going to go back and argue there was not one piece of evidence whatsoever that there was any reasonable likelihood that the Feds would investigate your case?
10-545 +++$+++        I'm curious to go back a second.     I thought Justice Sotomayor's question was: Imagine Smith in Germany.     He has written a book.     It's there, already exists, but it has no copyright protection in the United States.     So, after this, would he be more willing to send it to the United States?     And I take it your answer is no.     The reason is because I can go and buy a copy and sell it in the United States even without this law.     Is that right or wrong?       Well, see, that's what -- -- isn't that the question?     The question is, now that Smith has the same protection in the United States that Germany gave him, doesn't that give him an incentive to send his book to the U.S.?     I'm thinking about that one. I thought:     Not much, because I can go buy it today without this law and bring it to the United States and sell as many as I want.     But nonetheless --       What is -- that's not right?       Well, don't just jump on my answer as being correct if it's not. (Laughter.)       All right.     Then the answer --
10-553 +++$+++        What is your take -- what is your reaction to a less dramatic kind of holding? Suppose we were to say the truth is that the particular individual here does have some religious obligations in teaching and quite a lot that aren't.     So, she's sort of on the edge.     At the same time, there is a statute which, whether it applies or not, you could take the principle, and it says a religious organization like your client may require that she conform to the religious tenets of the organization. So, Congress focused on this.     And the district court looks at it, and suppose it were to decide:     That's true, but there's no evidence here at all that religious tenets had anything to do with her being dismissed.     No one mentioned them.     She didn't know about them.     I didn't until I read the very excellent brief filed by the Lutherans that explained the nature of taking civil suits.     No one said that to her, whether it was in someone's mind or not.     She found out on motion for summary judgment.     So, therefore, this wasn't an effort by the religious organization to express its tenets.     She was dismissed. She could have -- they could have had a defense, but it doesn't apply, and, therefore, even though she's sort of like a minister, she loses. What are your objections to that?       Did anyone mention that to her?       Really?     My law clerk couldn't find it.     Can you tell me where -- where someone did say the reason we're dismissing you is because of our religious doctrine that you cannot bring civil suits?       I mean, does anyone explain to her, which she might not have known, that this is a religious doctrine that you are supposed to go to the synod or whatever, and you're not supposed to go to court?       Of course, they wanted to fire her because she threatened to sue them.     But what I'm wondering is, is there anywhere before the motion for summary judgment where someone explains to her, our motivation here is due to our religious tenet?       No, no.     I understand that. But I went on a different piece of -- matter, that the people who were involved in this were doing it for religious rather than civil reasons.     I'm just wondering what the evidence is that they knew there was such a doctrine, that they were motivated by the religious doctrine, and that they expressed that to her.     I just -- I'll look at page 55.     Is there anything else I should look at?       I'm looking for a citation in the record?     I just wonder, is there anything you want me to read other than page 55?
10-568 +++$+++        You agree with Justice Scalia?       The statute says "or advocate the passage of."     So I guess that's speech.       And the -- I mean, the basic question is, again, do you agree with Justice Scalia's question, the import of it; or don't you?       If it doesn't apply, if voting is not speech, then no matter how outrageous the law or rule, it doesn't fall within the First Amendment; and if it is speech, then you get into some of the questions that were raised, is this too vague or is it not? So which is it?       -- which says -       -- either it is speech or not, and so that's why we're asking the question, to get your opinion -       -- which is an informed opinion, about how we should write that paragraph.     Do we say that voting is within the First Amendment scope or do we say it is not?       In that case, the most outrageous law you can think of -       -- in respect of voting is not covered by the First Amendment?       No, I'm not asking for willing to do -       I think his argument is -- I don't see -- that the Ethics Commission at least in part relied upon the fact that he was the campaign manager, and he is saying, I think, as I understand it, or at least I have this question, that an ethics commission cannot disqualify a legislator on the ground, even in part, that an individual had a political association with him previously.       It may be a new argument in this Court, I don't know.       Is that a new argument in this Court, as I've stated it to you?       You made that argument below?
10-577 +++$+++        I mean, why wouldn't that be an attempt to evade?     That's why he went; he didn't like to pay his taxes.       Well, 7201.     Why can't you -- well, why doesn't that violate 7201?     I mean, my simple question really is you are a drafter, imagine you are a drafter, and you are charged with drafting section (43).     And you read -- you try to get the fraud and deceit crimes, okay?     So now we read 76 -- 7206(1) and (2).     And you see for both of those, you can't be convicted unless you materially and willfully make a false statement. So, you think, hey, I don't need a special section on that one.     But then you go to 7201, and you say, oh, my God, I just thought, somebody might violate this by going off to some special country, taking all his assets and writing ha-ha-ha.     Now, there's no fraud and deceit in that.     He's totally open about it.     But he sure has evaded it.     So, therefore, I better write a special section. Now, that's the simple-minded argument, but what's wrong with it?
10-6 +++$+++ 
10-63 +++$+++        Before you get to the court, could I ask you about what the State attorney, the prosecuting attorney, knew?     Did the prosecuting attorney know that these two individuals from New York were representing this person?       All right.     So you think you have -- in your view, the counsel of record knew that these two people in New York were part of the representation.     Did the counsel -- I mean, not the counsel of record; the counsel for the State. Did the counsel know that they hadn't gotten the notice?       Is there any reason to think that the State attorney or whoever was prosecuting thought that the local counsel was likely not to do much?       Yes?     Okay.       All right.     Now, so it's possible -- we'll find out later -- that the State -- the prosecuting attorney who works for the State knew all those things:     One, he's represented by counsel in New York; two, they didn't get the notice; three, the local attorney isn't going to do anything; and conclusion:     They likely knew he didn't get the notice, but they are asserting that this is an adequate State ground to bar him coming into habeas; is that the correct posture of the case?       So, all we have to decide is whether under these circumstances the State attorney's knowledge of all those facts mean that the State cannot assert this is an adequate State ground.
10-637 +++$+++        Why?     I mean, normally a lawyer just looks to see what the docket is.     And when there's a case that seems to affect his case, he asks for cert.     And our practice normally, since I have been here, is where it implicates a case, you hold it until the case is decided.     Then the writing judge or other people look through it and see if in fact it really does affect it, and if it does, we GVR. I mean, as a practicing lawyer here, have you discovered instances where we've failed to do that, do you think?       I'm having trouble following it.     It may be my fault.     But I -- but the -- suppose the Supreme Court has now some kind of interpretation of something that's new.     All right. Now, there are going to be a wide range of people that that many might apply to whose convictions became final or just about final in State courts at different times. So, it's obviously always going to be somewhat unfair and somewhat arbitrary that it applies to some and not to others. So, what is the problem here?     What -- the reading of the statute on the other side says:     I'll tell you who it applies to or who it doesn't apply to. It doesn't apply to people where the last State court decision was made before the Supreme Court made its decision.     That's it.     Now, that's arbitrary somewhat, but you have to cut and draw a line somewhere.       What's the problem?     Why is that complicated?       Yes.       But the person would say Look, the State supreme court has -- you -- we're under a decision here the exact opposite of what the United States Supreme Court held.     Will you please either take our case and hear it or at least send it back to the lower court? And wouldn't most State supreme courts do it?       It's not impossible to get out, because he says here's -- bring your collateral State.     And Now, the collateral State, you're imagining, says, no, we can't have it --       -- because it's time-barred.       Then you go into habeas, and you say the time bar is no good --       And it's such an important opinion, you know, for all the reasons in Teague, that what they did is to time-bar and they wouldn't hear it. Okay, so you hear it.     And the claim is that they made a mistake.     That State court that wouldn't hear it made a mistake in not hearing it and deciding it for me.     Okay? So, now we have a State court thing to review.
10-6549 +++$+++        That doesn't mean -- that doesn't mean SORNA doesn't apply; it means 2250 doesn't apply.       Is that right?       I mean, it might be a metaphysical, but it may be that Congress intended the statute to apply to people like your client, but the question is when the initial registration has to take place.     And I took you as saying until the Attorney General acts, we don't know.     So, 2250 doesn't - doesn't criminalize a failure until he can know when he's supposed to register.       That's right.     Okay.
10-680 +++$+++        Suppose the policeman had said:     I'm taking you away with me for 20 minutes, period.     Takes him away, puts him in a place, asks him questions for 20 minutes.     All right?     Does he have to Mirandize him?       No, those are the totality.       I just gave you the totality.       No, no, no.     I'm taking you to a special room, and in this special room, I'm going to ask you questions for 20 minutes.       There's no other circumstance.     That's it.     Everything else is the same as here, except he added those words.     Now what?       Not in custody.       He's only going to be there for 20 minutes.       He would have thought he could leave after 20 minutes.       Okay.       Now, outside -- we walk outside, there's a policeman in the street, and he says to someone who's a suspect:     Come with me; I'm taking you to jail; I'm going to ask you questions for 20 minutes.     He takes him to a barred room; he can't get out for 20 minutes.     He has to Mirandize him?       What's the difference?
10-694 +++$+++ 
10-699 +++$+++ 
10-704 +++$+++       To what --      I'm asking you a specific 15     question.    I mean, if I were supposed to take into 16     account his statement, I had no reason -- to paraphrase 17     it a little -- for thinking that any of these guns, 18     other guns, were going to be used for any purpose that's 19     illegal -- if he'd said that afterwards, if I take that 20     into account, I say, why isn't that the end of the case? 21     He had no cause to ask for the other guns, period.    Now, 22     that was --      -- the question, I think 25     roughly, that you were being asked, and I would like to hear the answer.    I thought the answer would be:    I 2     don't have the right to take it into account.    Now, do I 3     or don't I?      Or before the -- is -- do I 10     look at the affidavits and the warrant, or do I also 11     look at things that are in neither of those documents 12     but were in the officer's head?      All right.    So, if I look 22     at whether he was in good faith, if he has any training 23     at all, I would guess that if he thought that there is 24     no -- I don't remember the exact words -- no reason, no 25     reason to believe there would be any weapons in the house, no reason to believe there would be any handguns 2     in the house, and then I say, I want a warrant to search 3     for handguns in the house, it looks like you're asking 4     for a warrant to search for that for which you have no 5     reason to believe it's there.    Now, that I would have 6     thought was not good faith.    That was contrary to the 7     Fourth Amendment.    Why isn't it?      Even though you can search 14     a person's house -- why don't I search the person's 15     house for an atomic bomb?    And I say      What cause is there to 7     think -- what cause is there to think that the gang guns 8     will be used to commit a crime?
10-708 +++$+++       So, let me just be -- use 21     an example, a hypothetical based on the next case, 22     really.    I was thinking Congress passes a law, says you 23     can't phone people between 7      And anyone who gets such a 3     phone call gets $500 in damages automatically if they 4     sue in court if they receive such a call. The harm was getting the call.    So, my grandmother, who is always complaining no one ever calls 7     her, loved the telephone call.    She loved it.    Best 8     thing happened to her in a month.    Okay? 9                 Now, can she sue?      So, in other words, if the 21     FDA bans a substance on the ground that 98 percent of 22     the people it hurts, and there's some kind of automatic 23     recovery, $500, anybody who bought the substance because 24     it wasn't supposed to be sold, and she's one of 25     the 2 percent that it helped --      -- can't sue?      Well, here she was exposed, 12     or the plaintiff was exposed, to the kind of transaction 13     that Congress said was harmful as a general matter, just 14     like the example you gave.      Suppose Congress makes a 13     finding, and this is the finding on the basis of a kickback.    And they write that right 2     into the statute.
10-76 +++$+++        So, why -- why -- I mean, you've heard the argument in the last case.     I mean, it seemed that potentially can subject the smallest manufacturer to liability throughout the world because it uses the Internet.     And -- and that -- I don't know what the foreign policy -- you've heard treaties discussed, et cetera.     Do you want to say anything?
10-779 +++$+++ 
10-788 +++$+++        But what is the reason why, if we give absolute immunity to the witness at a trial, we give absolute immunity to the prosecutors and government officials at the trial, and a grand jury is sort of like a trial, at least it's testimony under oath.     And in addition there's this special thing about grand juries being secret, which, if you allow people who are annoyed -- and they'd be quite rightly angry. They've been acquitted.     They had to go through this process.     They want to sue somebody.     If we let them sue, you'll wreck the secrecy in a lot of cases.     So, I see a reason for treating the grand jury even more strictly.     What's the reason for treating it less strictly?       Suppose I don't accept that.     Suppose I say, yes, I accept that, there's a relationship, but exactly what happened in 1871 is not precisely always the convincing feature for me.     So, I read what the situation is today, and it is, I think, as I described it.     So, given the situation today, my question remains.       You can't disagree with my question. (Laughter.)       I would like an answer to my question.       Are there States that have -- or are there any jurisdictions where they don't give immunity to grand jury testimony for complaining witnesses or others?       Today are there a lot?       But, I mean, is there any way to find out what's happened?     Have they been -- have the grand juries been undermined?     Have they not been undermined?     I mean, what has actually happened in those places?       Can you give me an example of one or two States that allow these actions?       For how long have they had that?       For how long?       And -- and have there been many such grand jury actions?
10-8145 +++$+++        I'm not surprised they're correct. (Laughter.)
10-844 +++$+++ 
10-8505 +++$+++       Yes, I would have 10     thought -- yes.    You can -- sorry, go ahead.      Because I understand every 9     argument you're making as fitting it in with hearsay.    I 10     agree with that.    And I also agree to a degree with the 11     testimonial point.    And I see the need for an exception, 12     and Wigmore provides all the reasons, and since we're 13     interpreting that word "testimonial," don't we have the 14     power, and why shouldn't we create one out of the word 15     "testimonial"?      Well, I'll go further in 22     your direction --      Yes, but Wigmore actually 6     believed that the Confrontation Clause simply 7     encapsulated the hearsay rule.      I'm asking you the question, and I -- I'll go further in your direction. 13     I'll go further, because I would say what about saying 14     this:    that not only do we recognize the exception, but 15     it isn't a full exception; that if the defendant can 16     show some reason to believe that either the laboratory 17     is not properly accredited, it isn't doing things 18     properly; or that the individual technician has something personal or knows about -- about the defendant 20     that makes it suspect, immediately the presumption that 21     the exception applies disappears, and the prosecutor has 22     to call the -- the witness. You can say, well, we shouldn't make that 24     up, but I believe if you go back to the 18th century, 25     you'll discover that your interpretation of the Confrontation Clause was not there.    So -- so, that's 2     what's basing my question, and I'd like your reaction. 3     It's a long question, considers an exception, and I'd 4     like you to give me your reaction to that.      And I mean it because I see 16     extending those cases from one individual from a laboratory being familiar with the results to requiring, 18     in ordinary cases, the calling of what could be up to 10 19     technicians -- I see that as making a sea change in 20     normal criminal law practices, and my motive is as I 21     said:    I fear it will push the system in the direction 22     of relying on less reliable eyewitness testimony rather 23     than more reliable technical laboratory DNA-type evidence.    Now, you have my -- I've made the point, and 25     I really want to get your response.
10-875 +++$+++       What happens in a 12 or 13 4     case, just your typical case -- and this must arise 5     fairly often -- in year 1, on January 1, the farm or the 6     ship or whatever is the subject goes into chapter 12 or 7     13.    They have a lot of pre-1 debt.    Then in year 2 and 8     year 3, the proceedings are going on, but the farm is 9     operating, so is the ship, or whatever.    And they earn -- they run up debts during that time.    People give 11     them fertilizer -- they give them, you know, all kinds 12     of things.    So, they have a lot of debts that they've 13     run up in that time.    Now it draws to a close, at the 14     end of year 3. Now, what about those debts that have been 16     run up during that time?    There isn't a separate bankruptcy estate for tax purposes, I understand.    But 18     if Joe Smith has loaned his farm some money during that 19     time, and it comes time to look at the future income to 20     subtract the prepetition debts, does his debt get wound 21     up and get some priority in that process, or is he just 22     at the end of the queue?      All right.    Well, if he gets priority, then why in heaven's name shouldn't a tax 2     get priority?      That's your point.      The -- what you say to me 3     makes a great deal of sense, but I think one of their 4     stronger arguments is, it may make sense.    But, unfortunately, even if Senator Grassley and the others 6     wanted it, they didn't do it right technically.    They 7     didn't amend the right provision of the code, and 8     whoever's fault that is, is beside the point.    So, 9     there's no way to get the words to get to the result that you want.      The -- the -- you get to 25     1226(b)(1), and it says that that's -- shall be paid any unpaid payments of that kind, including administrative 2     expenses.    And -- and so, then you have 1222(a), which 3     refers to that, and then the amendment applies to that. 4                 But, now, what I did was I sloughed over by 5     talking too quickly -- it talked about "claim" -- of a 6     "claim," it says, any unpaid claim of the kind specified 7     in 507(a)(2).    And when you look to 507(a)(2), it talks 8     about claims and expenses; and then in (2) there, it 9     refers to administrative expenses.    And so, I think the 10     Government says they left out what was key to you, the 11     word "expenses." All right?    Now, I don't know what I'm doing 13     when I start tinkering with this Bankruptcy Code.    And 14     is that just true, what they say?    It does leave out the 15     word "expenses."    Will -- will we cause untold harm if 16     we were to read the word "claims" there to include 17     expenses?      No, but I was thinking, 25     suppose I do it by reading the word "claims" --      -- in 5 -- in 1226, when it 3     says "any unpaid claim" --      Which is what you want to 6     have include taxes --      -- to read that word as 9     including both the 507(a) claims, which are in (1)(a), 10     (1)(b), and -- and also administrative expenses in (2). 11     Can I do that?      And there must be instances 16     where the -- where the debts run up postpetition are 17     pretty big --      -- and there isn't enough 20     money to go around, and they're going to have to be paid 21     out of future income along with the prepetition debts. 22     And it can be done, but there is a question of priorities, and the Government is saying there is no 24     priority -- I think they're saying that -- for a postpetition debt.    And -- and you're saying, oh, but of course there is.      Get paid, if necessary, by 8     assigning priorities?      And so, to look to a 12     hornbook on bankruptcy law which just tells me what 13     you've just said, I would look where?
10-879 +++$+++        What I'm concerned about I think is the same thing that the Chief Justice mentioned, the particular language in Napier.     And whatever -- however this might come out today if Napier were decided again, it did come out the way it did.     And Justice Brandeis did write it, and it's been the law a long time. And the argument is made in Napier that this particular State regulation is aimed at preventing sickness and disease, not at making locomotives safe, and, therefore, it's not pre-empted.     And the answer to that was not sickness and disease are an object of the statute, too.     The answer was the Federal and the State statutes are directed to the same subject, the equipment of locomotives; and, therefore, it is pre-empted. Now, how could we come out in your favor without overturning what seems to be that key sentence in Napier?     That is the problem that's bothering me.       I see.     Okay.     That's a -- the problem with (a) is that it's been followed and followed and followed and followed, and really read for all its worth, and so forth.     So -- so one question is, to what extent can I go back and revise that sentence? That's (a).     Okay?     What's (b)?       Not -- now, is there any way that you could win your case -- reasonably, in a reasonable way, not some far-out way -- but you win your case on this, and it does not affect the manufacturers' way of dealing with their equipment?       What is that?       You just -- you just said that, which I think you certainly have the right to bring a claim, don't you, to say the repair shop doesn't have adequate warnings.     And if -- if that's -- if the railroad's at fault in that, or the manufacturers or the owner of the repair shop, everybody who ever puts the asbestos in there is negligent in not putting up adequate warnings. What's wrong with that?       What about -- what about not --       What about getting away from the equipment and saying the failure here is not to fail to put it on the equipment; it's to fail to put it in the repair shop?       There's something I'm not seeing.       So, what's the difference then?     How do you do it?     How do you -- how do you -- what is it you're thinking of that the manufacturer's going to have to do in respect to his locomotive in order to comply with the State law about warning that is not going to mean that he changes the locomotive when it runs on the railroad?       Well, give me an example.       Does that have anything to do with this case, the removal, never further -- no further use of a bit of a locomotive?       No.     Okay.     Let's get to this case.       Oh, I didn't know anybody denied that, that the State could regulate the repair shop, indeed require what warnings they wish, indeed require what equipment workers have to have.     I thought we're only talking about those rules of State law that would affect what the manufacturer has to put by way of design in his locomotive.       And that's what I'm having trouble thinking of one that would only affect repair shops and repairs, but -- maybe there's some kind of equipment that you could stick on the front of it, and it is a hook or something -- and it holds something, and before it goes back on the line, you take it off and put it in a locker.     And -- but, you know, the more I thought along those lines, I thought I'm getting into outer space.     This isn't reality.     So --       All right.     Now, does that have more than theoretical value in this case?
10-895 +++$+++ 
10-8974 +++$+++        What does that mean?       What is --       Go ahead.     You were saying on a case that all you want to do is red-flag it for the judge.       All right.     Now, how does that differ from what exists in I think every State and certainly in the Federal Rules in Rule 403?     The judge may exclude evidence if its relevance is outweighed by its prejudice or misleading the jury.     So, why, in any instance where you think that this statement about to come in is unreliable for various reasons, you say: Judge, will you please look please look at Rule 403?     I have some experts over here and whatever else you want that would show that this is misleading to the jury. For all the reasons you have said in your brief, right? All right.     So -- so, since that is already the law and it does apply to every piece of evidence, including all the things we've been talking about, what is it that you want to change?       I didn't say what's different about it.     I'm not looking for a difference. I'm looking -- I'm saying they're all the same.     And, indeed, we do what you want right now.     It's called Rule 403 in the Federal system.     What I'm asking you is what is it you want done, since all you want is the judge to look at it carefully, that is not done at this moment?       No, but, judges don't, I'm sure -- I'm not 100 percent sure; you'd have to ask a trial judge.     But I am sure there are instances where judges say under Rule 403:     I conclude it is misleading and it is prejudicial and it can't be made up for; therefore, I exclude it. All right?     That happens.     Now, since that's what you want the judge to do, I repeat my question: What is the difference between what you're asking for and what already exists in the law?       Unless -- well, go ahead.       Whoa, wait.     Let me stop you there, because now what you seem to be saying is it isn't the case that you simply want the judge to look at this with care; rather, you want the judge to change her result.     You want sometimes this to be excluded where under 403 it is sometimes not excluded.     All right. Now, I asked, if that's what you want, that's a different matter.     That's a substantive standard.     And so, you're proposing a different substantive standard, and I want to know what it is.
10-930 +++$+++        What if the -- it might be unusual, but you can't try a person who's not competent. You can't try him.       So what about -- and now, he's been tried, and he's been convicted and been appealed and gone through the procedures.     But some case could arise where, in habeas, they made like a prima facie showing or a -- convinced the judge that there really is a very good chance here, or maybe even I think it's probable that the basic trial was unfair, to the point where it's like not having a trial. What about in that situation, if it ever arises?     I mean, should we leave the door open just for that possibility?       I have that.     That's why I put in the possibility that, on the basis of what's presented to me, the judge, I think I have so much without this defendant's testimony here suggesting it was unfair, that maybe the presumption should shift back.     I'm -- that's what's worrying me in the back of my mind, that there could be such a case.     There have been in history.       Which he can't do, if he's not competent.       But, I mean, trial judges run their trials.     You know, that's what they're hired for.     And once we make it clear, it shouldn't go on forever.     And -- and why can't we trust them to do their job?       You mean it shouldn't be indefinite. The object of this is you're trying to give -- like you would with any witness who's not around at the moment, you're trying to produce a hearing that will reach a result with this witness.     And if you think, after a reasonable period of time, that witness will recover and be available, fine.     And if there is no hope of that, forget it.     I mean -- you know, something like that.       Why would we, in this kind of case, as opposed to, say, some other case, where a witness is missing and it's crucial?     The district court does have authority to grant stays.     And we haven't said, but no longer than a year.     Why do we say, but if they do it in a reasonable time? If they abuse their discretion, there is mandamus, or there are other ways of controlling the discretion.     Why are we suddenly here, in this case, imposing a fixed number of days? I mean, the reason, of course, that the Psychological Association says 6 months to 9 months is they have different studies.     In some places, it's 6 months; in some places, it's 9 months.     And -- and so why are we picking a number out of a hat here, when we don't elsewhere?       It should, but it should be something like reasonable or -- or don't abuse your discretion or -- I mean, at the moment, I'm just not seeing why this is different than 10,000 other kinds of instances where we set that kind of limit, rather than days.
10-945 +++$+++        Well, which is it you're doing?     I mean, I imagine -- I thought you were saying you always need reasonable suspicion.     So, I imagine a case where the person is going to be arrested, put into the general prison population.     There is a warrant out against him for second-degree murder, and the policeman stopping him for a traffic offense arrests him because he knows he is wanted on a warrant in another place. And the jail has a policy that says when you're -- come in here because of second-degree murder, we strip search you.     Okay?     Can they do that under your rule or not?       That's all they know.        Then you do not want to - then you are not saying it always has to be reasonable suspicion.       Oh, all right.     Well, that isn't helping me.       What helps me is to know what the category of things is that the jail in your opinion is going to have to look into the characteristics of this individual person, and when I look at the ABA, they talk about minor arrests.       And when I look at some of the cases, there's a long list, like violence, drugs, and so forth, where you don't have to, where you can just use a general -- the fact that he was arrested -   -- for the thing.     But there are other ones, minor ones, where you do.     So, what's your rule on that?       Okay.     Then the next question which we'll get -       -- who is a minor offender and how do you administer that rule?       All right.     That's what I'm -       Unfortunately, I'm asking you and not them, and it's the same question.       How do you want us to write this so that jail personnel all over the country -       -- have to be able to follow it and know exactly what they're supposed to do.       You said before was 2 feet is too close, but 5 feet is okay.     Are you sticking with that?       Yes.
10-948 +++$+++  
10-9646 +++$+++ 
10-98 +++$+++        Suppose -- suppose that a prosecutor reads the statute, there must be an affidavit that says this witness is material.     And there is irrefutable evidence that the prosecutor said to colleagues and others:     I do not intend to try this person, ever, no matter what; I just want to ask him questions.     In that case, has the statute been violated because he is not material?       I'm not saying it's this case.     I'm saying it's a hypothetical case.       And the reason it is not material is because the prosecutor has no intention whatsoever of ever bringing this person as a witness in any trial.       All right.       If materiality is violated, does not then that -- that prosecutor -- since he had no intention of bringing him to trial or of having him as a witness at a trial, that prosecutor would not be immune?       -- yes.       Well, how does -- how does it -       I would like to go back to the statute.     If an officer fills out an affidavit for a search and says there were drugs in the house, so I want to search it, and it turns out he was lying, you would have a damages action?       Yes, yes.       No, no.     I'm saying the officer, because he told a lie.       All right.     Now here it says that the person filling out the affidavit has to say he is a material witness.     So suppose that the plaintiffs were to prove that the individual who signed that was not telling the truth in saying he is a material instant -- witness because not just but for, but there was no possibility he would call this individual, none.     And that's what they have to prove. It's really very hard burden of proof. Now, one, would that interfere significantly with law enforcement?     And, two, how do you distinguish it from the drug case?       But in the case of the agent, you're prepared to say that we will allow the plaintiff to go into his motive to the extent that the plaintiff can show there is no possibility he intended to call this individual?
10-9995 +++$+++ 
105, Orig. +++$+++                You're right.           They are all different.   They did a lot of work on that.                      I -- I know they did a lot of work on this.                Congress has a statute, and the statute is:       We don't care if the witness is Albert Einstein, Steven Spielberg, or the local zookeeper.   Okay.    We don't care.               We don't care if they did a lot of work or a little work.                       We want them to be paid $40 a day, period.          It's too much trouble to figure out how much work they did.              That's what we want. That's the law. Now, Justice Alito said:                     I agree with you for argument's sake; we are not bound by that rule.                       But I take it his question, which I heard no answer to, is: Assume you are right; we are not bound by the law; still, why shouldn't we follow it?               Have do you any example where Congress had a statute which says every court in the United States must pay da-da-da, whatever that number is; it's $382.50, okay.               Now, despite that clear statute, this court for exactly the same thing paid a different amount.    Is there any such case?               Okay.       And is there anything in the -- in the nature of litigation?                    And there might be.   I'm not asking it as a rhetorical question.   Is there anything in the nature of original jurisdiction lawsuits that, as a general matter, would call for higher fees to be paid for witnesses, or to make a distinction between expert witnesses and others, or to do other things that would complicate it? I'm not speaking of your case.                    You have a wonderfully strong case in your case.                    I want to know about in general, in original actions.               If anything, the parties are in a better position to pay the money than the average person.              It's not unfair to have a rule which says each party pays his own experts, win or lose.    That's the rule, isn't it?              If you lose this case, if we were to follow Congress, we would have adopted a rule where, because the $40 is trivial, each party pays his own experts.    Is that right or wrong?              Well, can we do this then? I think maybe in many cases that are technical in nature it might be quite a good thing for the losing party to pay the winning side's lawyers.              Well, should we do that, too?    If we are going to have them pay the experts, why don't we have them, the losing side, pay the lawyers' fees?    That would be quite a revolution.               I'm sorry.       I got mixed up on my dates.    The words "in any court of the United" -- what the words are now is "in any court."                 It says "court of the United States includes" in 451 courts. When did that language come in?               In '48?               So the inclusion wasn't there till then.   Now, normally, in the '48 revision, the rule is they intended to make no substantive change. When they did intend to make a substantive change, they said as much.   So is there anything in the history of that that suggests they intended to make a substantive change here?               No?               So, in other words, the language "in addition to the courts listed in section 451 of this title," that -- those words I just said have no appearance in the statutes before 1948?                  Yes or no.               They do appear before?               No, they do not.               First time in 1948.        So they were put in there by a revisor.             And there is no indication the revisor intended to change the meaning that pre-existed.             Okay.       I got the argument. Thank you.
11-10189 +++$+++ 
11-1025 +++$+++        Well, here is -- I assume that it is an injury for an American speaking in America to have his communication intercepted against his will by the American government.     We take that as a harm; is that right?       Okay.     So the question is how likely is that to occur?       All right.     Fine.     That's why I say certainly -- it might not be a storm tomorrow. I mean, you know, nothing is certain.     But I see it's some degree of what you say -- some people say certainly, some people say likelihood, etc.     So put that to the side. What I want to know is, we have the declaration of Mr. Scott MCKay.     Now, Mr. Scott MCKay says he's represented two of the people who are allegedly part of al Qaeda and committed crimes, and he has represented them for some time.     One was in Guantanamo.     Another is charged with various crimes and is subject to many, many civil suits. In the course of that, he has to phone and has phoned lots of people in Saudi Arabia, in the various Arab states, and in the past the U.S. intercepted some 10,000 telephone calls and 20,000 e-mail communications involving his client. So isn't it a fair inference, almost pretty certain, maybe about as much as the storm, that if the security agencies are doing their job, they will, in fact, intercept further communications involving this particular individual, the two that he's representing?       And why doesn't that meet the test?       But why can't we get an answer to that question?     I mean, I see your point.     I'm interrupting because I -- I see where you're going.     And it seems to me that, at least, if held in camera, I can't imagine what security it would violate, whether the government were to say, if necessary privately to a judge, would say, no, we do not intend to use this new authority for this purpose.       Or it could say the contrary.     And so couldn't we find out whether he has standing there without jeopardizing any concern of national security?       Well, there is if, in fact, the government is going to use this statute to continue to do some of the 10,000 or 20,000 --       Yes.       Well, you think it's speculation.     The government has a statute that says you can wiretap in the United States organized crime when life is at stake and you show it to a judge.     Then they say, that isn't good enough.     We pass a new statute, and it says, suppression of organized crime, wiretap when you want, without a judge. Now, a lawyer who represents organized crime says, my clients have been wiretapped under the first statute 400,000 times. Now, I'll tell you, when the government gets ahold of this second statute, it's going to be a million times, because they want to suppress organized crime. I'm not saying my clients are guilty, but we all know. Okay.     So. Now, the question, which I haven't thought of before, you are saying no standing, no standing, can't raise it --       No, you can't.     You can't do that here.     So -- so what I'm thinking is, he seems to be separate from other people.     He seems very likely to have a concrete injury.     If they -- if they aren't wiretapping the people who are described here, who are they wiretapping?     And they passed this statute in order to have extra authority. So put those three things together, and they seem to spell mother, perhaps, you know.
11-10362 +++$+++ 
11-1059 +++$+++        All right.     But this, I take it, is a statutory case, not a constitutional case. That is, do you have any constitutional objection if Congress had said, in 216(b), that Joe Smith and other people similarly situated to Miss Laura Symczyk have a genuine dispute with the employer, and the way they file their case is Miss Symczyk's case will be deemed to be their case as well, though it ceases to be their case, unless they confirm within 60 days of such-and-such, in writing, that it is their case. If Congress passed that statute, there couldn't be a constitutional objection to it, could there?       No, no, no.     Do you see what I'm driving at? In other words, if Congress had explicitly said, in 216(b), that the Third Circuit's procedure is the correct procedure for Mr. Joe Smith to bring his case in such circumstances, if they had said that explicitly, is there a constitutional objection?     If so, what could it be?       Now, I could find nothing the other way, so I thought of the canon of interpretation that equity deems to have been done what ought to have been done -- or something like that. Others on the Court will know -- but the -- the point is that there are instances --       What?     Yes. It remained on the docket in the Westminster courts, even though there was no plaintiff. So I would ask you again:     Is there any counterexample?     Is there any instance from equity or elsewhere, where there is a constitutional objection, had they said it, at which point our question is have they said it?       No, no.     It's Mr. Joe Smith, if he confirms it in writing.       All right.     That's true. And so what we would be reading into this statute is a relation-back doctrine, which happens every day of the week in class action cases and has historical analogies. So I understand the difference you're pointing to, but why not read that in?     It would be fair, and it would get the job done, that Congress sets up in the statute.     That's the argument the other way.
11-1085 +++$+++        Or you can take exactly what you said and phrase it the opposite way.       You can say  No I know is it the purpose of the certification stage to try out every element of liability at that stage, rather than waiting for the trial?       No, it's not.     Good. Now, once you say that, what you have said is, you know, it could still be material for some individual, even though there is no market reliance. And similarly, a silence going (indicating), some odd set of words or whatever it is, although it's not false for almost anybody, for some particular person, it could seem -- convey something false in some particular set of circumstances. So let's try out falsity at the certification stage, too.     In fact, let's try out everything because we could always think of a few examples where, despite the fact that -- you know, that it's only a common issue 99 percent of the time, we can dream up a situation where it's not a common issue.       No, but you are saying with a cert -- class certification here, if there is no materiality, there is no class; and you are repeatedly faced with the question, you are absolutely right; in fact, there is no case.     And so then what you say is, and indeed, I have a few instances here in which there could be a case, and Id say, I bet if we are -- you know, professorial enough, we could dream up a hypothetical for anything, where there still is a case.       Traditionally, how did that work?     How did that work traditionally?     No class, okay? Joe -- Farmer Jones comes in, you have to show it's false?     You have to show it's material.     And then you show the reliance that he did something on that basis.       So the materiality was not part of reliance.     Materiality was an element that was always proved, and then you went on to show reliance.       And the reason that we want to prove it upfront in the 23, rather than wait till the merits, where it will be argued anyway in exactly the same way -- the reason that we want to do it first is, since it's going to be there anyway and going to be litigated anyway, unlike publicity, unlike efficiency, but the reason we take this one and run it upfront is? And it can't be the answer we should litigate everything before we litigate anything.       Okay.     So -- so what's the answer?
11-1118 +++$+++  
11-1160 +++$+++        Well, what about the other? The next line that they give is they give to the hospital authority the power to acquire and operate projects and the power to form and operate one or more networks of hospitals, physicians, and other healthcare providers. Now, as I read that, it certainly includes the rather specific power of acquiring a hospital.     And having read that -- not -- not just something you might see in General Motors' charter.       And -- and those -- that's the language of the -- of the grant of power. Now, I want to know what you want us to do because, in my mind, reading this, it's a statute that provides for regulation -- price regulation of hospitals.     And you say -- and I have no doubt you thought of one way in which that could be -- I can think of 100 -- that you could have prices that are different from those set by a free market.     So I have no doubt that this sets -- I start there. Now, what is it -- I go back to Justice Scalia's original question:     What is it you want us to say?     Even though this -- this statute is immune, does grant immunity from attack on a basis of cost and price regulation, it is not immune in respect to mergers, okay?       I can, unfortunately, think of about 50 examples, where a merger might be anticompetitive, and yet, it would lead to lower prices. And the Department of Justice might attack it, but this statute -- and that's what's bothering me -- seems to want to further that kind of thing.       That -- that's where I am, and I -- I'm not at all decided.       Yes, I think I know that.       You are not understanding my question, I guess.     You have to take as a given that, even though what you say is true, I would find that this statute clearly prohibits the application of the antitrust laws to pricing decisions.     That's the job of the authority. Now, if I start with that, then you will say, okay, I have to decide against you.     Or you might say, even so, I win because mergers are different.     Now, that -- that's what I'm trying to get you to say.       I want to ask you they different?       After all, we have, one, the specific language I read; and, two, I can think of examples where a merger would be anticompetitive under the DOJ and your FTC rules --       -- and yet, probably would further the purposes of the statute by lowering the cost.       Do you think that's the null set?     I -- I don't think that's --       What does the words mean, "to form and operate one or more major networks of hospitals"?       Which follow -- which follow the words "to acquire and operate projects, defined to include hospitals."     So -- so what about those words?     Why aren't they good enough?       I'm looking at Section 30 -- well, where are we?     31-7-75(3).       And this falls within the words "to acquire and operate projects"?       And --       And can't -- in other words, the -- the two hospitals in the town, when they say, the price here -- you shall see that the price is not higher than 38 cents, whatever, and would you please get together and be certain that you have similar terms and you have similar agreements and similar prices there, we don't want either of you to be higher, that -- you would then proceed against them for that?       And would you also do the same if -- if the electricity regulator in any State or telephone -- a local telephone regulator --       -- or gas pipeline regulator -- what they did is the same thing; they said, our prices are -- you're to file tariffs, and the tariffs are to be reached after you go meet in committee; and that -- that would also fall within the antitrust laws?       How is that?       Well, the language is awfully similar to what you find in public utility statutes, to set reasonable rates, to be certain that nobody is higher than a reasonable rate.       Well, what does it mean to establish rates and charges for the services and use of the facilities of the authority?
11-1175 +++$+++        I mean, my problem with this is I don't -- I mean, I read the whole statute, and they have a good claim until I think you read the whole statute.     And I don't know what to say, other than the impression -- the impression is that subsection 3, which is what's at issue, the whole thing is meant to say that the winner, when it's the plaintiff, is going to get attorney's fees. You know, it mentions costs, but that's the background rule.     And then when you get to the second sentence of that, it means, and if you're in bad faith, the plaintiff, then the defendant gets attorney's fees. It doesn't really mention costs.     That's the background rule. So -- and I look at the legislative history, there's some staffer, at least, who's tried to find that interesting; the -- they're talking about what the point of this is, and say the whole point of this section is to help prevent frivolous suits. Well, so there we are.     That's -- that's where I am at this moment.       I didn't say, on some technical linguistic basis, it may do that, that's correct.     But perhaps I'm unique in this, but I don't just look at the language, I look at the context, I look at the purpose, and -- and I don't see anything in the language that gets rid of the background rule, and I don't see anything in the purpose that gets rid of the background rule, and I don't see anything in the history that gets rid of the background rule.       I don't see anything in the consequences that suggests that you get rid of the background rule.     I don't see anything in our traditions that says you should get rid of the background rule. So what -- what do you do with some obstreperous judge who doesn't just look at the language?     I mean, I know who uses it, but that's not the only thing.       Oh, why?     A person who is a drafter says -- you know, you get your costs and you also get the attorney's fees.     They don't -- they don't know every statute, the people who draft this.     They -- they -- they just say, Senator, what are we trying to do?     He says, we're trying to give them attorney's fees. They say, okay, we'll give them the costs and the attorney's fees.       And that's if you had been drafting it, perhaps.     But the people who actually draft these things are a whole section over in Congress, they don't know every statute, and you give them a general instruction.       And the -- the general instruction would be add attorney's fees on the plaintiffs and add attorney -- Alright.     You understand the point.       Yes, ignorance of other laws.      That's right, general ignorance. (Laughter.)      Well, then they shouldn't have put those words in.    But we're talking about the next sentence.    And the next sentence doesn't put the words in.     So you're -- you're -- you're assuming from that fact that, in a pro defendant -- this is a pro-defendant provision they put in, that was their whole point apparently reading it -- that what they decided to do is take away from defendant's costs, which they normally get, without saying anything about it. I mean, that's -- you understand the problem.       It doesn't -- where does it say that?     Where was the --       -- I would like to read it.       Did you look up -- did you try to do any sampling on that?     Because I did, actually, and -- and I discovered something that I think is not as strong for you, but it isn't too much against you. We just did a random sample of 28 successful cases, and I think the average recovery -- except for one outlier, where it was very high, -it was around $4,000 -- 3 to 4, and the average costs on the ones that the defendants won, I guess, was around a thousand.    So you have a point --      But it isn't quite as good a point, as you seem to suggest.     That is, it's a not so low value and the costs are not so high --      -- in order to make it.       So she says if I -- if I tease -- if you tease your sister, I'm going to give you -- give her your allowance and her allowance, that that doesn't mean that the sister loses her allowance if you don't tease her. I mean, there are a lot of instances --       -- where you put the "and" in and it doesn't mean that that's the exclusive place for giving it.     Sometimes, it does; sometimes, it doesn't.     That's her point.       Well, I doubt that it does. I'm sorry.     I mean, they're human beings over there; they're not necessarily all --
11-1221 +++$+++ 
11-1231 +++$+++        All right.     But that -- that's why I wonder what the basic underlying principle is.     I mean, I would have thought -- but I'm not sure what you think, that -- that the way to look at these cases is, using ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, would a reasonable legislator, having enacted these words, intend to give the agency a degree of leeway in interpreting the statute? Now, if that's the basic question, it helps, but isn't determinative whether you classify this as a claims processing rule or a jurisdictional rule.     Those are conclusions.     But, really, it's the question of leeway that the Congress intended to -- to delegate to the agency that is determinative. If the answer to that question is yes, your rule stands, regardless of label, and if the answer to the question is no, it fails regardless of label.
11-1274 +++$+++        Does it apply to Social Security?     Does it apply to Veterans Affairs?       Does this statute apply to Social Security?       Does it apply to Veterans Affairs?     Yes or no or you don't know?       What about Social Security?       Then, I'm asking about this statute.     Does it apply?       Defense Department?       Antitrust?       FTC, you don't know?       It does apply to FTC, okay. So Social Security, FTC.     Veterans Affairs we don't know, antitrust we don't know.     Okay.       Medicare, Medicaid?
11-1285 +++$+++        So if I were -- if I were Joe Smith, and a plan -- the plan pays me 100 -- I have medical expenses of $100,000.     And, actually, the - the -- there was a driver who caused this problem.     And later, I collect 100,000, but I have to pay 50,000 to get the 100,000. So I am left with 50,000 net because I had to pay my lawyers, I had to pay expert witnesses, there were a lot of different things I had to pay.     I'm left with 50,000 now.     So in comes the plan and says, we want 100,000.     I say, what?     Then I look at the language.     The language allows them to get back expenses which were recovered from the third-party. I didn't recover 100,000 from the third-party.     I recovered 50,000 from the third-party because it cost me 50 to get the 100. Now, if I were a judge and listening to that, I'd say, assuming they wanted a reasonable interpretation of this language, it sounds pretty reasonable to me.       It's a little tough, since nobody had the plan.       All right.     But, I mean, wouldn't the normal result of such a case, like any contract case, where you have language, even if it was the word "any," it doesn't mean wheat grown on Mars, okay? And so you'd say -- if it says you can recover anything, that "any expense," it means, yes, you can recover that which was paid, but not money that you had to pay to get the amount paid.       But this is a plan that they wrote and that US Air --       All right.     So I can --       What is the issue of law? The issue of law is what happens if we have a plan which says, Joe Smith, my employee, if you have to spend $90,000 to get back 92,000, you have to give us back all , even though you only have 2 in pocket.     And we are supposed to assume that's what the contract said.     Is that right? And then -- and then we say, now, can you override that with the principle of equity?     Is that the issue you see before us?       Suppose the expense weren't to pay the lawyer.     Suppose, in order to get the 100,000, you had, for example, to build a model car to demonstrate to the manufacturer what caused the injury, and it cost you 98,000 to do it.     And they pay you ,000. You're saying that -- it wouldn't be unjust to say the 100,000 has to go to -- back to pay US Air?
11-1327 +++$+++        I see the problem, but I am still back to where Justice Kennedy was -- and that is my own failing here.     I didn't quite understand.     I thought, when you grant a dismissal and you dismiss the case in the middle of the trial because the prosecution was brought too late, all you're doing is, in the middle of the trial, granting something you should have granted in the first place before you impaneled the jury. But I thought that, in Fong Foo, Judge Wyzanski had dismissed the case after empanelment because he wrongly thought that the U.S. attorney had been talking to a witness or a juror or something at lunch time and that he had -- and that's an acquittal. And I thought Justice Harlan, for the Court, wrote Double Jeopardy, Jeopardy attached, you can't try him again.     And I didn't think the Court ever overruled that.     That -- what -- in where?       So Scott says that even in judge-wise -- Scott says Fong Foo was wrong, that that -- because the reason that Charlie Wyzanski dismissed it is he has this idea of a -- the AUSA doing something improper at lunch.     And -- and that's -- that's -- now, on your theory -- on the theory you just enunciated, there would -- there would -- Double Jeopardy wouldn't protect against the second indictment, right?       Yes.       Yes.     Yes.     That's --
11-1347 +++$+++        Well, what he says is that, after 18 months in Scotland, the Scottish court will decide where is the habitual residence of the child.     We are now in August of year 2, and what happened before January of year 1 is now totally irrelevant.     So even if the American courts decided prior to January of year 1 the correct habitual residence was Alabama, when the -- when the Scottish courts decide what is his habitual residence as of 18 months later, they won't pay any attention at all to that American decision because it is not relevant. That, I take it, to be his argument, which depends on the long time, 18 months.     So what is your response?
11-1351 +++$+++        What would -- what do you do, if anything, about those of us -- I hope more than one -- who actually look at legislative history, and the House and Senate Report -- the Senate Report says Subsection (e) would nullify a provision of the Tort Claims Act, which would otherwise exclude any action for assault and battery, then the House says about the same thing. So, when I look at those two things, I think the purpose of this Act was to do just exactly what the other side says, it was to get rid of assault and battery as an exception and said the government of the United States will pay for unlawful assault and battery. That's what the two reports say.     That's why they passed it.
11-139 +++$+++        Even without Chevron -- I mean, even apply it, I would have thought the point of Brand X is you look at the language of the statute and you look at what Congress intended, and where they intended the agency to have power to interpret, you follow the agency.     And you could do that after the event if the basis for your decision is that it isn't clear. But that isn't Harlan's opinion at all.     He goes and looks at what Congress meant, and what they meant is treat basis like you treat a deduction.     And he gathers that from the legislative history.     And so, I don't see the basis for saying now the agency still has power. Now, forget that one.     I mean, that's one point you might want to address, but I may be too unique in that, in which case it's not worth your time.       No, I didn't think that was the basis.     I thought the basis is that there are two kinds of things:     One is you just don't put in some big category of stuff in your return, and the agency can never figure that one out.     And the other is where you don't state your deductions correctly. And now, the cost of goods sold and the basis are difficult cases because of the way the -- the code defined "gross income."     It defines it in terms of gain.     But Harlan says they're like deductions for purposes of this statute.     That's how I read it. But I have a different question.     You can pursue this one if you want.     My -- what's really bothering me about this case -- and I can't quite figure out the answer to this -- is it seems to me when they filed that tax return in April of 2000, it was a terrible loophole, but these lawyers have the job of creating loopholes or at least trying to take advantage of them.     Okay?     And the IRS had told them this was okay.     Indeed, they had informal advice to that effect. Now, there's a -- you don't put the date of the year 2000 reg, and I don't know if you're both talking about the same thing.     I was really surprised there was no date there.     Then what happens is, after you lose in every circuit -- not you personally -- they lose in every circuit; and then in the year 2009, they say, though we lost and though we told everybody this is okay at the time they filed the return, now we're going to pass a new reg and we're going to penalize them, taking all back this money 9 years later.     That seems to me pretty unfair.     So, I'd like to know just that answer.       You say in your brief on page 4:     "In 2000, the IRS issued a notice informing taxpayers that Son-of-BOSS transactions were invalid under the tax law."     And you cite without a date.     So, I was sort of curious whether that particular cite came before or after they filed their return.       And they say that -- and I -- in July 2000, 3 months after they were filed, the Commissioner reiterated his view:     "It has long been held that the extended statute of limitations," da, da, da, "is limited to when specific receipts or accruals are left out of the" -- of gross income, which is basically the Colony statement.       Are you talking about the same thing?       Okay.       So, there are two different documents.     So -- so, in July, they're telling the tax bar this is okay.     And what you say is this document here, which you refer to without a date, told them it wasn't okay.       I'd be rather curious if you could sort that out.       I -- I know there are many ways of downplaying that, but I'm just curious as to what happened.     What about the one you cited?     When was that?       What about the -- that's the July.     What about this other, undated one?     Now, I notice what you say about it.     You said that it described "arrangements that unlawfully 'purport to give'" them -- if I read that piece of paper, which I might -- and you probably read it because you cited it -- will I come away with the impression, uh-oh, these loophole arrangements, Son of BOSS, which previously seemed to be okay are now not okay?     Is that the impression I'll have?       Is that the impression you had?       Okay.     All right.     That's what I suspect.     Then look at the unfairness of this. I'm not saying there aren't worse unfairnesses in the world, but, nonetheless, people spent a lot of money. The whole Bar has gone to an enormous effort. Everything up through 2000 being -- seems to say you can do this.     You have a case on point in the Supreme Court. And then 9 years later, after continuous litigation, the IRS promulgates a regulation which tries to reach back and capture people who filed their return 9 years before.
11-1425 +++$+++        So why can't you do that? I mean, the only virtue I see in saying you have to go get a warrant is the officer picks up the phone, there is usually somebody on duty, a magistrate somewhere, he phones him up and says, I have a drunk driver here; he's wobbling, he can't cross the center line; and he won't take a breathalyzer; I want to give him a test. Now, you have a second judgment and the officer has to talk to somebody, so he's a little more careful.     And that's a protection, not necessarily for this person, but a protection for others who maybe weren't wobbling. All right.    So I think that's the question you're being asked.    Why -- what's the problem with doing that?    Which adds a little bit of security that this warrant really is -- this search is really necessary.       Why wouldn't it take -- let's see, how long did it take me to say that?    It took me about 30 seconds.    So -- so even if you are a lot more careful, why would it take more than, say, 3 minutes?      Well, what you do is you have a system, and you phone up and you do just what I said.    And this man or woman who is there is not a policeman.    That's the virtue of it is this man or woman is trained to listen to policemen and others say things and try to pin him down a little bit and make an independent judgment.    So -- so why would it take more than 5 minutes?
11-1447 +++$+++        So -- so what I think might be driving some of these questions is the district court says -- just as you say, had Koontz offered additional mitigation -- the additional that would have cost $10,000, he would have gotten the permit.     That's what he said. So then you look back to see what additional mitigation.     And, here, we have in the record, at least that my law clerk finds -- you know, that -- that they went to Koontz and they said, here are some choices: Install a subsurface stormwater management system in the development -- I mean, right on your land -- or reduce the size to one acre; or eliminate the filling of the slide slope areas; or replace 15 culverts and eliminate a ditch system somewhere else; or enhance 50 acres somewhere else. Now, at that point, when -- and then they said, won't you negotiate for 30 more days, maybe we can find some other things?     He says, no, I'll bring a lawsuit.     Okay. Now, I absolutely can see a Penn Central claim there.     But the land -- what you're talking about is not some land somewhere off the site.     We're talking about his land.     If, after all, they said you have to leave all the coal in the mine to hold up the ceiling -- you know what I'm referring to -- then they go too far. And, here, if we look at all these conditions proposed and said -- you know, this is just terrible, they don't do it for anybody else, your client's the only one, it bears no relation, oh, it just goes too far, you win under Penn Central. So I can see the framework here.     I'm not saying you're going to win, but I got it clear what the framework is.     But suddenly you bring this Nollan/Dolan business into it, and I get confused.     And the reason is because there was a different piece of land in Nollan and Dolan. The piece of land that was different was an easement in front of -- and an easement is a piece of property in Nollan, and there was a bike path in Dolan, right across his property. So -- so I don't see how Nollan and Dolan have to do with this.     I see everything that Penn Central has to do with it, and that grows out of the nature of what was being offered.     You are saying what they are offering you is simply going too far.     Okay. I've got that conceptually. I ask this question because all these briefs are about Nollan and Dolan, and I don't understand what they have to do with it.     I must be missing something, and that's why I am asking you.       But, of course, they are land claims because they took a piece of land, which everybody assumes -- right in front of his house -- and said, you've got to let everybody from the beaches walk back and forth from one beach in the north to another one in the south, and they are going to walk over your land. And the Court said, you can't take his land unless you have a nexus to some public purpose that is related to his building the house.     I got it.     I just don't see what it has to do with this case.       Of course, you can.     In fact, there is too much coal.     That's an unconstitutional condition.     It goes too far, and there is a framework called Penn Central, which deals with it.       All right.     I think there -- all right.     I'm assuming that in your favor.     All right. be good. bad.       The -- the -- but -- but in any case, the -- the point is, you see, I assume that in your favor.     I'm trying to figure out the conceptual framework.     I assume that in your favor.     I assume whether they didn't issue the permit and would have, but they haven't quite, or maybe they have -- it means nothing. Now, having assumed that, it seems to me what your argument is, is that this is a form of regulatory taking of the kind that Holmes was talking about.     And that -- that's what was going on in -- in Penn Central, and so we simply look to see if it went too far or whatever.     The lower courts could do that.     I got that part. Now, I want you to answer the question, which is, am I right?     Is there another part -- a different part to this case, called the Nollan/Dolan part and explain that to me.     That's why I asked the question.     I want to hear what you're going to say.
11-1450 +++$+++        This is what I -- could you go back --       -- to Justice Kagan's first question?     I was looking at the words of the statute. And if I look at 1332, which has been on the books a long time, it says, "The district court shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest, of costs, and" -- et cetera, okay? Then I look here, and it says, "The district court shall have jurisdiction of any civil action in which the manner in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $5 million, exclusive of interest and costs," et cetera, okay?     So the words seem identical. Now, in respect to the first, we know that a lawyer can file a binding stipulation that says, I don't care what this is about, I am not asking for more than $75,000, and the Federal court does not have jurisdiction.     Given that's true in the first statute, and given that the second statute is almost identically worded, at least in that part, why can't he do the same thing with the $5 million? And it can't be the words I quoted that stopped him from doing it, so what is the word that stops him from doing it?       Yes, as to what that looks like, "shall be aggregated," again from the language, is it's simply to make certain that Zahn does not require the individual -- thing to approach -- to count.     In other words, you aggregate rather than just looking at the individual members, which is Zahn, which has nothing to do with the issue before us.       No, they rarely pass a statute that says, let's just get rid of case X. Normally they look to the holding of case X, and then they pass the statute that says the opposite.     So the holding of Zahn was that you could not aggregate the individual members' claims in a class.     So to get rid of Zahn, what we do is we pass a statute that says you can aggregate. And indeed, nobody objects here to the aggregation.     It's the total amount of the claims being limited by a stipulation that is the issue here, and that's why I had trouble finding your argument in the word "aggregation."
11-1518 +++$+++        Could -- could you go back, please, to Justice Alito's question?     I -- I don't understand the answer to that.     That is, I don't understand, and it's just something I don't understand. I'm not saying it facetiously.     I don't understand the relationship of mental state to the issue. I mean, I didn't think there is any doubt here that the individual, your client, knew what he was doing.     He knew for a fact that he was taking money from the trust.     He knew he was giving it to his mother.     And he knows where it's going.     And he knows it was later paid back with 6 percent interest.     So you don't have to assume extreme recklessness.     He knew it. Now, what he didn't know was that that was unlawful.     And therefore, if I look at the accompanying things, embezzlement, larceny, fraud in the trust, I don't think any of them require a knowledge that what you're doing is unlawful. So if I -- or do they?     I don't think -- you can be convicted of embezzlement while misunderstanding the law of embezzlement. You can be convicted of larceny, it's saying.     And as far as I know, a person to commit fraud lies, knows it's material, knows, et cetera, but he doesn't have to know there's a law against it.     And - and so -- if I do what Justice Harlan was doing and comparing it to the other three, it looks as if you don't need to know that what you're doing is against the law, where you commit defalcation. Now, that I think is what Justice Alito was driving at.     And I'd like to hear an absolutely clear answer on that.       But I didn't think there's any respect here in which missing -- mistake of law, would negate the mental state as to having taken money from the trust, used it in the family business and then paid it back, which I take it are, we assume, which is a different question I have, but for present purposes, we are assuming that that's sufficient for defalcation. Is that right?     Where is it and where does it negative the intent in respect to what happened?       No, it had nothing to do with recklessness.     He did these three things knowingly. That is a stronger mental state than recklessness, not a weaker one.       Were unlawful.     So we're back at the same question, and I'm now assuming you have no answer to the question because there is none.       Yes, but you see -- should I have to write the opinion in this case, I would have to deal with this issue and I'd have to say something about it.     And as soon as I look at the other words, those are words like "embezzlement," "larceny," and "fraud."     Now, elsewhere in the U.S. Code where those are crimes ignorance of the law is not an excuse.     It often is an excuse where in fact it's a tax violation or some other technical violation. So I would have to explain why the word "defalcation" when linked to those three is being treated differently.     Or I'd have to say Congress used words which never have ignorance of the law as an excuse and meant them differently.     Each of those is pretty hard to say.       I have one other question on a different subject that may be more helpful to you or not.     I think of defalcation as the individual who has defalcated shows up in Rio with two suitcases full of money, and it seems to me if you look at the root of the word, it consists of diminishing, taking a sickle and cutting something down, and therefore it did seem to refer to an instance where you take the corpus or money belonging to the trust, now it becomes ambiguous, and you run off with it. Is there anything you would like to say about that?
11-1545 +++$+++        All right.     Suppose you win on that, okay?       But, I mean, at some point, I will hope you -- I hope you will go into what I'd call the question of we have a statute, just as Justice Ginsburg said, it's an expert statute.     It is a statute in an agency that has all kinds of discretionary authority.     It includes an important substantive question about what the relation is with the cable television in this area -- post -- not cable, but -- you know, the broadcast posts. And so all these factors here, which suggest, of course, Congress, which is not expert, would have wanted the FCC to figure this one out.       That -- that -- at some point -- you don't have to go into it at all, if you don't want to, but I just want to put that on the table. (Laughter.)       You don't have to talk about it now, but you can talk about it whenever you want. (Laughter.)
11-159 +++$+++ 
11-161 +++$+++        I thought there were a lot more than -- there are 20 different lots, 20 different -- there are -- I mean, when -- what's your view of -- of how the cutoff should work?     Do they have to refund all the money, everybody who, in fact, ever paid a Barrett Law assessment?       I don't care what the State is; I'm saying a matter of constitutional law.       Okay.     All right.     So what?       Why can the State, when they have, let's say, 10,000 people who have already paid their assessments -- well, why doesn't it have to give them back their money, on your theory?     That's my simple question.       Why aren't they?       Okay.     Fine.     They define here who is similarly situated, and the people who aren't are the ones who are on the installment plan.       They do.     They do.     The reason is because they think it's unfair to give the people -- they think it's -- they don't want to bother collecting it from these people who haven't paid yet. Okay?     That's why.     And they don't see a way, if you - so, if we're going to free them, we don't want to go back into history and then suddenly give back all the people who've ever paid their assessment.     I mean -- so, we draw the line somewhere.       This is where we're drawing it.     That's the State law.       What's wrong with that?       I mean -- my point, I'm not making it clear.     My point is that what's less rational about saying, if you paid, too bad; we're having an amnesty for the future?     What's less rational about doing that than saying some of the people who paid in full will get their money back, and some will not? Which is the line you want to draw.       But that isn't the administrative -- the administrative -- well, maybe that's one of them.     The administrative problem is, I thought, the following:     Imagine that you are the city mayor.     All right?     And suppose the mayor does what you want.     The mayor says I'll give all these people in their project back their money. The next day in my office, there show up 15 people who say:     Last month, we happened to be in project 2, and we paid all our money.     Why don't you give us back our money?     You just gave it to the people in project 1.     Give it to us. And the next day after that, there are 14 people from project 3 and from project 4.     What is your answer to those angry taxpayers who have said we don't understand why you refunded the money from project 1 but not for us? What's your answer?       I might have missed a fact, which -- which I'd like to know.     Let's call your project, project 1, all right?     And all the others are 2 through 20.     Are there any people in projects 2 through who still have money outstanding, or are they all paid off?       They're in various states. Okay.     What happened to the taxpayers who still owe money in projects 2 through 20?       Okay.     So, it's the same. So, now the people for the angry taxpayers in projects 2 through 20 show up at the mayor and say, Mayor, you're not only -- you only -- you're not only -- under your system, you not only gave the all-paid-up people back, if you win, but you also forgave the future people in 2 through 20, and you're not giving us our money back.       Am I right on the facts?       Yes.     Older projects.       Yes.     Right.       Yes.       Oh, I see the -       Oddly enough, I was not suggesting that. (Laughter.)       The goal here is very simple.     They say we have hundreds or dozens or 20 different programs anyway, and once we start getting into the business of distinguishing among people who are already paid up, it's going to be a nightmare.     And so, the only clear line we draw is between the people who are already paid up and the people who haven't paid. And we don't want those people who haven't paid to have to pay because that's going to be another 20 years of administrating $33 a month. Okay.     That's their rationale.     Now, that may not be perfect, but it sounds reasonable, doesn't it?     What's wrong with it?       It's not their rationale, or it's not perfect?       It's not impossible.     They don't say it's impossible.     Say, try looking through the U.S. tax code.     It has thousands of pages.     There is not one human being alive who understands every provision. All we have to do is start comparing the provision on page 1 with page 3 with page 7 and page 9, and we will discover irrationality forever. So, I don't -- I mean, you may have this fairly simple case, but I foresee, if you win, the - don't ask me what will happen, but I have a suspicion it's not going to be too good.       What?       The argument isn't that it's expensive to administer as much as it is there are 1,000 people in all these projects who are already paid up.     We don't have enough money to pay them all back. That's why we don't want to pay them back.     At the same time, we don't want to collect the money for 30 years from these other people who aren't fully paid yet.       The question, I guess, is, is that rational?
11-166 +++$+++        And so what's wrong with that? I mean, a creditor loaned you a million dollars.    For the million dollars, he got an interest -- a secured interest in a piece of property.    And that property is worth whatever it was -- whatever it's worth -- less than a million, and he says that's the deal. I -- I have a secured interest in this; I want the property.    Now, you are better off because you can stretch out the payments over time, and maybe you don't have to give it to him immediately, but I don't see anything unfair about saying, give him the property if he wants it.       Well, in accordance with (i), (ii) and (iii).     I mean, I'm not saying skip those.       I don't understand that. I mean, as I read it, to put it out on the table, I read this makes perfect sense.     What they are trying to do is help the debtor a little, without mucking up the secured creditor's collateral.     Choice (i), give the secured creditor his collateral, and there is still a lien on it.     He has what he had before, and the debtor is better off because he can stretch the payments out over time, and that's one and two. Choice (ii), we give the creditor some new collateral.     Hmm, that's a little risky, but to be sure it's fair, we are absolutely certain, with a few exceptions not relevant, that the creditor can credit bid.     So he has it within his control. Choice (iii), something else which comes up in different situations, for example, a creditor who is over-secured, see, and -- and they want to sell the piece of property.     And he says, sure, I will let you sell it, but I want something that's the equivalent, give me this other property over here that you own, that has no liens at all.     And the judge can look at that and say that's fair.     That's what (iii) is basically about, as far as I could understand it. So it all makes sense to me.     And I don't understand why you would want to have a rule saying that (iii) trumps (i) and (ii) and stops credit bidding.       So that's the whole thing, as I am seeing it at this moment.     So I'll give you a chance to reply.       No, it doesn't have the language, which is why we have a case.     But, I mean, trying to interpret it in a way that makes sense, what is wrong with what I said as a way that makes sense? I mean, why, since we are trying to give the -- the creditor the indubitable value, at the very least -- the best way to do that would be let the creditor credit bid.       So why not?     And you can read it.     You don't have to read it the way that -- that you want.     You could read it the opposite way, too.       No, I'm looking at it from the perspective of a bankruptcy system --       -- that is trying to get secured creditors what they have their security in, while giving the debtor the advantage here of being able to stretch out his payments.      You said -- look, in subsection (iii), if it applies here -- I assume there's -- suppose it doesn't apply here.    There is a safeguard against having no bidder. Bidders who would bid more than what the creditor thinks it's worth, the creditor will want them in this.    And if they -- he doesn't want it in, it's because he thinks it's worth more in his own hands.    So what's the problem? But there is a problem the other way.     The problem the other way -- and I'm not saying it's this case, but there are -- is that the insiders say to the stalking horse, we would like you to put this up at a low price and give us a job.    And if they keep the creditor out, well, that's a big incentive. And they are the ones who know what a hotel is worth, the judge doesn't know, and there is always leeway.    And so that -- that was worrying me about this fact pattern.    You want -- you want to get rid of my worry?      Good.   You know, but the concern was -- I gather there is no other bidder, you have said.    You've just found the stalking horse.    You agree to pay the stalking horse a million and a half dollars, in case he doesn't get it.    And then the people from the inside are being hired by the stalking horse, if he wins.      Now, I'm not -- I'm sure they are acting very honestly.    But you would have to say, in such a situation, that there is an incentive to try to value everything on the low side by the debtor to make sure that stalking horse gets the property.     And that incentive is destroyed -- or at least doesn't work, if you allow the creditor bid.
11-182 +++$+++        How do they have -- well, the same question, but -- but I'm trying to think of examples.     Example one is the person is arrested.     Now, it says any person who is arrested shall have the person's immigration status determined before the person is released.     So I wonder, if they have arrested a citizen, he's Hispanic-looking.     He was jogging.     He has a backpack.     He has water in it and Pedialyte. So they think, oh, maybe this is an illegal person.     It happens he's a citizen of New Mexico.     And so the driver's license doesn't work. And, now, they put him in jail.     And are you -- can you represent to us -- I don't know if you can or not -- can you represent to us he will not stay in jail, in detention, for a significantly longer period of time than he would have stayed in the absence of Section 2(B)? Do you want to represent that or not?       All right.     Now, if you cannot represent that -- and I'm not surprised you don't want to -- I mean, I don't know --       What?       Oh, fine.       But the Fourth Amendment -- since -- for -- I mean, that's -- that's another question.     I don't know how long the Fourth Amendment allows.     I don't know on that.     There probably is a range of things.     But we do know that a person, ordinarily, for this crime, X, would have been released after a day. Oh, you know, the Fourth Amendment would have allowed more.     So, now, what I want to know is what, in practice, will happen? You -- from your representation, I think that there will be a significant number of people -- some of whom won't be arrested.     It takes 11 minutes for some.     For citizens, it might take two hours.     It might take two days.     Okay.     There will be a significant number of people who will be detained, at the stop or in prison, for a significantly longer period of time than in the absence of 2(B). Is that a fair conclusion?       That's a different argument --       All right.     Can I make the following statement in the opinion -- and you will say that's okay.     Imagine -- this is imaginary.     "We interpret" -- imagine -- "we interpret Section 2(B) as not authorizing or requiring the detention of any individual under 2(B), either at the stop or in prison, for a significantly longer period of time than that person would have been detained in the absence of 2(B)." Can I make that statement in an opinion, and you'll say, that's right?       But can I say that?       No.
11-184 +++$+++ 
11-192 +++$+++ 
11-199 +++$+++        You didn't -- you didn't read the whole thing.     I -- it's a little hard to understand.     And looking at the transcript on page 769, am I right?     I want to get my own understanding right. At that moment your client's lawyer, who they call "Beau" -- is that right?       Okay.     All right. Your client's lawyer, namely you -- (Laughter.)       -- has not yet seen the client; is that right?     They think you haven't seen the client yet.     They say somewhere you haven't even talked to him yet or -- he hasn't even talked to Beau.     He hasn't seen his lawyer yet.     They say that two paragraphs earlier. So, is that right, basically, that they think that, anyway?     You see at the top of the page, about six lines down:     He hasn't even talked to the lawyer yet.     He hasn't even talked to Beau.       Oh, they're talking about the lawyer.     All right.     And what you're trying to do, as far as I can read this, is they think what you're trying to do is you want Perez to plead guilty.     Is that the fair thrust of this?       What do you think it means?       All right.     So, it's hard to tell what they're talking about, I grant you that.     I thought they were talking about trying -- that you thought it would be better if everybody got some kind of agreement worked out. And then she says, Perez's wife:     "How can I not worry?"     He says:     "I don't understand what's going on."     Which is fair comment.     "But it's not the way Beau -- he's putting it two different ways.     If he didn't explain to you the way, then, either -- then it's a different story.     If you don't ask him" -- Then she says:     "Yes, he's saying that everybody's going to lose.     He's saying that whatever he wants to say.     I don't believe him." Well, by the time I got through reading that, I wasn't certain what they were talking about, and I thought it sounded like they're talking about:     Let's all make an agreement or everybody's going to lose. And -- and I could see that you could say that's prejudicial.     I could also see that the government could say it isn't prejudicial.     And it's pretty hard for me to read their opinion as thinking they were really not thinking about that error.     I mean that was -- or not an error.     I mean, of course, they'd be thinking about that; that was the issue. And as I read the opinion, they said, well, there's so much other evidence in the case, and in our opinion, this is weak enough that it didn't -- wouldn't have made a difference and -- and if you didn't, say, take it for the truth. And the other, dissenting judge, common, is thinking:     No, I don't know; you know, it's pretty hard to understand what it means, but there's an implication there the lawyer thinks he's guilty of some kind, and in context that might have made a difference.     So, he comes to a different conclusion. That's what I saw going on.     And I didn't see some big war of standards.     I just saw judges disagreeing about a fairly tough question in an individual case.     So, what can you say to make me change my mind and think this is a war of standards that we ought to --       And, therefore, we would like you to clarify whether you do or did or did not take in the actual transcript page there, when you reached your conclusion.       Back to Justice --
11-204 +++$+++        That's my point, actually. That's where I'm sort of bothered, just exactly what Justice Scalia said, that if you look through what I've seen so far by the materials, they're pretty evenly balanced, and there are tens of thousands of people who work in this industry, and there's a history of 75 years of nobody said anything. So you would think -- and it isn't the only problem that has just been recognized in other industries, too.     If the agency is going to reverse, not reverse, but suddenly do something it hasn't done for years, the right way to do it is to have notice and comment, hearings, allow people to present their point of view, and then make some rules or determine what should happen.     Perhaps they'd say for the future let's do this, but not let's give people a windfall for the past.     Perhaps they'd say some and not others.     Okay? That's my instinctive reaction, not necessarily legal, but informed by administrative law. But why shouldn't I try to get there?       No, I've read those.       I'll go back and read them again, and if they're absolutely clear, you win, fine, that's the end of it.       You're right about that, and so, they're at fault, too.     But on the other hand, their employees might have been satisfied, and this is done to protect the employees. So, I'm asking, not saying, but what is the process here?     How do you know -- at what level was this agency decision made to suddenly go ahead with this? Who made it?     What was the input?     How do you know they're on your side?     You do know; you're right.     But I mean, what's the process internally?       Well, the alternative step ..-- well, did the Secretary of Labor herself or himself, depending on when it was, consider this matter?       No, we don't.     All right. So --       So, the alternative is not enforcement actions, necessarily.     The alternative is for the agency to focus on the question and decide what it actually wants to do.
11-210 +++$+++        The trouble is that you can think of 10,000 instances that meet your criteria that one candidate or another could bring up in a political campaign.     And we don't know what will come up, but I can easily think of examples.     And then, if this is lawful and constitutional, then you have people in political campaigns suddenly worrying that the U.S. attorney is going to come in and start indicting him. Now, that's part of the chilling effect.     And you've assumed you can get around this chilling effect, but I'm less certain.       How do we know this doesn't?
11-246 +++$+++        All right.     Well, then why isn't it just like your 30 days?       So what?       Can I -- the -- this is exactly the point that I don't understand.     Forget standing for a moment.     I'm just thinking of your quiet title action. This wasn't an action to quiet title at all. This was a -- I looked at the complaint, as I -- as I gather from his questions, so did the Chief Justice. And it is a complaint filed before the -- the property was taken into trust, and it asks for an injunction under the APA, if it wants review of that, before the government has any title to it at all, or at least it hasn't taken it into trust. So why are we considering quiet title?     What has that to do with this?     Why isn't it exactly what -- now, that's the same as the Chief Justice asked, and I have exactly the same question.       All right.     Well, why isn't that -- that's the end of that argument, then, isn't it? Because this suit was brought seeking an injunction before the land was taken into trust; the district court denies the request for the injunction.     The court of appeals reverses that.     And so there we are.     We're reviewing that action by the court of appeals, reviewing a judge who said you are not entitled to an injunction sought before the land was taken into trust.       Oh, I don't know about that. Well --       Well, I don't know how -- how we should treat that.     There -- there was an order. Suppose that order was wrong.     Suppose they should have granted the injunction.     Then isn't what we should do, send it back because that injunction should have been granted, then have a hearing or trial or whatever you want to have on whether the Act applies, and then figure out how you do relief?     Which I don't know.       They did.       He didn't appeal that.     He appealed it different --       But that -- but you don't -- you can't believe that totally because you agree there is some APA review of an action brought before the title shifts where, the claim is, you cannot take title, Secretary.     You agree with that.     You can bring some.       Okay.     Once you agree to that, I stop at the words, not just "under this section," but "to adjudicate a disputed title to real property." Then I read his complaint.     His complaint, on 31 to 38, is asking for an injunction, and it's asking for an injunction before they take any title to the property.     And maybe they went ahead and did it anyway, but is there some other complaint that I didn't read? Is there some amendment to the complaint in the record? If so, where is it?       I don't know what a constructive amendment is.
11-262 +++$+++        That -- we've never held that in respect to a claim that the real reason the police arrested was retaliation against, for example, a picket sign having an unpopular point of view or a statement having an unpopular point of view.     That is, this Court has never held that it overcomes an arrest where there's a claim of retaliatory First Amendment action; is that right?       All right.     And what you're saying is your first reason is that we should say that. And the -- the question I wanted to ask you there is, you make a very strong case where the President and Vice President are involved, the need to protect them, but the rule that you there adopt is a rule that will apply to every police officer, anyone who arrests anyone anywhere in the country, and no matter how clear it is that the motive was retaliation against a point of view, that individual will be protected from a Bivens action. So, it sounds as if your first claim -- the remedy sweeps well beyond the need that you sketch.     And so, I'd like your response to that.       I understand that.     I'm just saying if I agree with you on your first that if there is a probable cause for an arrest, then wouldn't I have to say there is no retaliatory First Amendment claim when a border officer chases into Arizona a person with whom he politically disagrees, and there are 14 bishops who will say he cared about nothing but his political disagreement?     And there's nothing to the contrary, and he says:     Oh, I happened to notice -- at trial -- that when he left he reached out and snatched a $5 bill that was in the till.     And so, I had probable cause to arrest him. End of case.     Now, that sounds very far-reaching, and I don't know that I'm prepared to do that.     So, therefore, is there another way you might win your case, or should I do that?       Yes.       But -- but you see, it's different arrests and prosecutions.       Illegitimate?     You just --       Look, you just used the word "crowd control."     And I take it, in saying the word "crowd control," you are making a distinction.       Do you want -- do you want the same rule of automatic, you know, immunity -- it's sort of automatic immunity -- when crowd control isn't at issue, where there's a history of persecution of an individual by a particular officer, da, da, da?     I mean, you know, we can make up cases.       Did you want it absolutely across the board, or are you going to start making distinctions?       I mean, I agree with you about the crowd control.       I see that.     I see that problem.     I see the problem of protecting people in public life; I see the problem in protecting the President.       Now, how far -- now, given that that's a particular problem where views are likely to be evidentiary -- unpopular views actually are, unfortunately, but how far do you extend it?     You say extend it to everything.     To jaywalking, to persecutions, to, you know -- that's what's making me a little nervous.       How many cases -- you might know this; you might have information on how many cases over 5 years or whatever period there actually have been against Federal protective officials of retaliatory First Amendment activity.       It would be in the Department, wouldn't it?     Do they keep track?       Do we know that this is not unique, the one before us?       But when you looked up your research for this, did you find any other case in which anyone had ever asserted a First Amendment claim of retaliation for an arrest?       Yes, against a Federal --       Against a Federal protective official.

11-345 +++$+++        And so, are you?     And, if so, why overrule a case into which so much thought and effort went and so many people across the country have depended on?       So your question is whether -- your point is does your case satisfy Grutter? Is that what you're arguing?       Well, how do you want to argue it right now in the next ten minutes?     I'm interested because I have a very short time to get my question out, and I need to know how you are going to argue it.       I agree it might, but I want to get to the question, so, what I'm trying to pinpoint, because we have such a limited time, and to me, the one thing I want to pinpoint, since you're arguing on that this satisfies Grutter, if properly understood, as you say that.     In looking up, we have a two-court rule. And two courts have found, it seems to me, that here, there is a certain thing -- there is no quota.     It is individualized.     It is time limited.     It was adopted after the consideration of race-neutral means.     Each applicant receives individual consideration, and race did not become the predominant factor. So I take those as a given.     And then I want to know what precisely it is that Grutter required in your opinion that makes this different from Grutter, in that it was not satisfied here?     The ones I listed, two courts say are the same.     So maybe there's some others.       But we have a rule that if two courts say it, we're very reluctant, on something connected with facts, to overturn it, so -- so that's why I mention that.       Okay.       Now, but the test is -- the test is, in your opinion -- I have to write this in the opinion, let's say -- the proper test of critical mass is, is the minority isolated, unable to speak out. That's the test.     And that wasn't in Grutter or was in Grutter?     And in your opinion, it was in Grutter?       Isolated.     And the reason it was satisfied there and not here is?       Or they could -- this is what is underlying my thing here.     I want to get you directly to answer it.     I did look up the figures.     And before Hopwood and the 10 percent plan, it looked on the African American side, that it averaged about 5 -- 5 percent per year, really, pretty steadily. Then after Hopwood and 10 percent, it went down a little bit, not a lot, but it went down to about and a half percent -- 4 percent, maybe.     And then they introduced Grutter, and it's back up to 5 percent.       Okay.     Now, is that a lot? Is that a little?     There are several thousand admissions officers in the United States, several thousand universities, and what is it we're going to say here that wasn't already said in Grutter, that isn't going to take hundreds or thousands of these people and have Federal judges dictating the policy of admission of all these universities?     You see why I'm looking for some certainty?       I saw what happened, you saw the numbers. Sorry.     Go ahead.       You can answer it later, if you want, or not answer it at all, if you don't. (Laughter.)       Uh-huh.       So what you want me to do is go read back what we wrote in Grutter, go look what the underlying determinations of critical mass were there, go look exactly how it is being done in Texas -- which I have charts that help me see that -- and I will then find enough of a difference that I can write some words that can be administered by 2,000 or 3,000 -- a thousand Federal judges as they try to deal with programs like this, in -- that's the point, is that right?
11-393 +++$+++        Can I ask you one question, which is a practical question?     I take as a given your answer to Justice Kennedy.     You're saying let's look at it objectively and say would Congress have intended this, okay?     This is the mandate in the community -- this is Titles I and II, the mandate, the community, pre-existing condition, okay?     Here's the rest of it, you know, and when I look through the rest of it, I have all kinds of stuff in there.     And I haven't read every word of that, I promise.     All right. I mean, as you pointed out, there's biosimilarity, there's breast feeding, there's promoting nurses and doctors to serve underserved areas, there's the CLASS Act, et cetera. What do you suggest we do?     I mean, should we appoint a special master with an instruction?     Should we go back to the district court?     You haven't argued most of these.     As I hear you now, you're pretty close to the SG.     I mean, you'd like it all struck down, but if we are supposed to apply the objective test, I don't know if you differ very much. So, what do you propose that we do other than spend a year reading all this and have you argue all of it?       I would say the Breast Feeding Act, the -- getting doctors to serve underserved areas, the biosimilar thing and drug regulation, the CLASS Act -- those have nothing to do with the stuff that we've been talking about yesterday and the day before, okay? So, if you tell me at that level, I'd say, sure, they have nothing to do with it; they could stand on their own.     The Indian thing, about helping the underserved Native Americans -- all that stuff has nothing to do with it.     Black lung disease, nothing to do with it.     Okay? So, that's -- you know what you have there? A total off-the-cuff impression.     So, that's why I'm asking you what should I do?
11-45 +++$+++        So, what's the problem?     He says -- the employee says I was dismissed.     MSPB says that's right, you were, and it's lawful.     The employee says but you didn't consider my argument that the relevant statute was unconstitutional.     MSPB says, no, we can't.     The Federal Circuit says but we can; so, make your argument.     What's the problem?     And then I'll decide it.     And if they decide it's unconstitutional, then the action of the MSPB is wrong.       I don't know -- I'm just saying, is there any practical problem with that?       Which is?       Fine, fine.     What they say is you have one argument here, that the statute that led to your dismissal was unconstitutional.       We do not have jurisdiction over that; therefore, we say you were rightly dismissed.       Now, they appeal that, and they say they're right that they didn't, but you do; so, will you please decide that this statute is unconstitutional?     What's the problem?       Ah.     It may be unusual.     I just want to know what's the problem.     I'm not saying there isn't one.     I want to know what's the problem with that.       No, it doesn't affirm the dismissal.     It says the dismissal was unconstitutional; go reinstate him.       Well, every day of the week we get constitutional claims, and people submit all their arguments in the briefs.     Now, occasionally, there's one you have to have factual development, and I grant you on that one maybe they could appoint a special master or, if not, send it back.     But they have plenty of authority to get them to argue the facts.     But I doubt -- I don't know if there are such claims.     But I don't see why that would be a problem.     Now, I'm not -- again, I'm not giving you an answer.     I'm giving you a question.       That's your conclusion, and I want to know what -- what is the practical reason that that wouldn't work or why is that such a big problem to have it work that way?     I'm asking for your answer on that.       Give me one where it wouldn't.       Give me one where it wouldn't.     But I don't want to cut into your time.     Your time is up.       So, you have to be thinking about it if you want to respond.
11-460 +++$+++        Okay.     So you say they have two remedies, that the NRDC, if they think you are polluting, could have done -- could do two things.     One, they could go and get some expert to try to get a sample or to make an estimate, based on what he knows about the industrial sites that it's actually your storm drains that are polluting.     That's one thing they could do; you say they didn't do it. Okay.     The second thing they could do is they go to the permitting authority, and they could say, will you please ask the L.A. County to monitor the actual storm drains when they come in, a sample thereof. And you're saying they could have done that, but they don't have to now because, now, that is a requirement. And we are doing it.       Okay.       Let me ask a quick question.       Does it satisfy you if we just write in the judgment what you -- we usually write, and then you all can argue what it means below?     What about that?     Does that satisfy?     Or do you want us to write something special? (Laughter.)
11-465 +++$+++        Well, why can't they just do what we used to do?     Many district judges do this and -- because there sometimes thousands of petitions of different kinds.     A lot go to the staff attorneys that look them over and flag the arguments, and you put at the end, just to be on the safe side: Any other arguments that are made are rejected.     All right. Now, that serves one purpose.     A human being has a hard time writing that unless he's thinking:     I've looked this over pretty carefully.     And if it's a staff attorney preparing a draft, the staff attorney doesn't want to -- doesn't want to write those words unless he or she has really looked with some care. And so it serves a purpose.     It means they don't do it just as a form.     They could turn it into a form, but they shouldn't.     And so if -- let them write that, and therefore if we get nothing then you put into play these presumptions, et cetera.       Well, anything.     Judges can not do their job.     But -- but when you write something like the word "denied," which is all most district judges write in respect to many motions, they read the motion, they think about it, that's their job. So -- so, similarly, a staff attorney or a judge who is going to have to write certain words will want to do his job or her job, and they will do it. So I'm just suggesting that it won't -- that isn't a big deal. Now, this case, they didn't write that for some reason.     Many do.       No.
11-551 +++$+++        I'm sorry, I'm not clear on what this hypothetical is.     I thought her hypothetical -- Justice Kagan's -- was a situation where the statute says, Mr. Secretary, you can spend no money beyond what is appropriated.       But the contract doesn't mention it.     That's Ferris. I thought that the -- the real world is, in contracting, you typically have both a statute that says don't pay more than is appropriated --       -- and in the contract, it says, "subject to appropriation," putting the contracting party on notice.       So which were you answering?       The words in the contract are "subject to appropriations."       Yes.       Okay.     So in that world -- now we get to the question -- in that world, what happens when 15 people each enter into such a contract for $100,000 each, and the appropriation turns out to be too small to pay all of them, but big enough to pay some?
11-556 +++$+++        Well, is there any?     You said he went through, you weren't preceding on the -- your client, originally in district court, not preceding on the basis of this straight Seventh Circuit test.     He had the EEOC look into it; the Government itself says that we should affirm and they have EEOC lawyers on it. And so is there any piece of information that would be relevant that you know of that you would introduce, were it sent back, say to the district court, that you have not already introduced?       I read what they said in the last page of their brief.     They said either affirm, that was their first thing, or send it back.     Okay.     Now my question remains the same.       Is there --       What is it?
11-564 +++$+++        That's true, but if you're looking at expectation of a reasonable homeowner, imagine you have a home, a long driveway.     You do expect people to come up and come into the house, knock on the door, maybe even with dogs.     Do you expect them to sit there for 5 to 15 minutes, 15 minutes, not knocking on the door, doing nothing?     I mean --       -- is that something I wouldn't -- would you be nervous about that?       Anyone coming to your door and not knocking.       Just sniffing.       No, there is in this sense. Justice Scalia just said it.     He said, you do have an expectation of people coming into your door, perhaps even with animals, perhaps even with binoculars, but not looking into the house, not looking into the house from the front step with the binoculars. Now, why is that unconstitutional?     Because it's very unusual that someone would do that, and a homeowner would resent it.       Would a homeowner resent someone coming with a large animal sitting in front of the front step on his property and sitting there sniffing for 5 to 15 minutes? Forget the sniffing.     Just talking, loud noises.     Is that something that you invite people to do?       Ah.     Is that what happened here?       I thought what happened here was 5 to 15 minutes.       Yes, but I -- what I'm curious about, and it's an unanswered question for me, is we are considering whether the dog sniff is permissible, so I wanted to know what a dog sniff at the front door involves.     And at page 96, 97, 98 of the joint appendix, with which you are familiar, it explains that.     It isn't just going up and (indicating); that's it.     It's a process called bracketing. They describe it at length.     The officer, the dog officer, said he was in a rush that day and it didn't take more than 5 to 10 minutes.     And my question really is whether an ordinary homeowner expects people to walk down the curtilage and, with a big animal, and the animal -- they don't knock.     They behave in the page 96, 97, 98 way. I subjectively think, well, that's pretty unusual behavior, whether it's a policeman or anybody else.     So what do you respond?       It was 5 to 10 minutes and it's 96-97.
11-5683 +++$+++        Yes, but how -- how many are we talking about, say, a 3-month period?     How many people commit -- most people -- everybody pleads guilty.     They're caught quickly and sentenced quickly -       I know not necessarily. That's why I want your estimate of how many we're talking about.       And how -- how long historically, roughly, if you know, does it take from the time the person's caught till the time he's sentenced, when he pleads guilty?       Eleven months?       But how many of -- you see what I'm trying to get at.     I'm trying to get at a guess, if you like, of how many people we're talking about.     The two numbers that I can't find in the briefs are roughly -- if your opponent is correct, and it only applies to new people, this thing.     That's the applicable law.     In other words, you're assuming the answer -- in your answer to Justice Scalia, you're assuming the answer. I haven't heard an argument for it, except that there are very few people that his interpretation or the opposite interpretation would catch.     And how many are there?       About?     I mean, is it more like 10, or is it more like 50, is it more like 100? Can you make a guess at all?       All right -       It isn't obvious to you what I'm trying to get at.       You -- you see what I'm trying to get at?     I guess -       No, no.       But you're saying it would be absurd to think that this section 8 has to do only with prior -- the pre-enactment offenses.     Absurd, all right?     If there's just likely to be one person, I tend to buy your absurdity argument.     If there's likely to be or 1,000, I'm much less certain.       Yes.       No, that argument -- of course, they could have had both in mind.     They could have had applicable law for the new people is our new statute; applicable for the old people, you don't need any amendment, we're not talking about that, just apply the old law.       That made perfect sense.       I'd imagine you'd find disagreement with that.     You know -- you know -- you know if -- as a matter of fact, in the year that these took effect, think of the sentences that were not governed by mandatory for crack, not governed by the mandatory minimum.     Did the guidelines provide, let's call it a low sentence, disproportionately low?       And did they change those non-mandatory part when they wrote new ones?       All right.     I'll look it up.     I'll look it up.
11-597 +++$+++        Which ones?     Because I counted eleven cases which either say, state, some seem to hold or support the proposition that when it's temporary with a flood it's a trespass, and where it's permanent it's a taking.     Okay? I mean, I have eleven.     And so I've got from my law clerk.     And then I tried to see, well, what are the ones that say the opposite?     And so far we've come up with zero.     All right? You could argue that there were three cases during the war which might be read that way, though they don't quite mention it.     All right? So which of the cases that you -- rather than list my eleven, I'm more interested in what you think, and so I'd like to know which are the ones you think support -- with something like a flood, which it's not -- you're not physically taking hold of the whole thing.     You're sending something in that comes back. Which of the ones support you that temporary is not a trespass, temporary is a taking?       Dickinson -- I got written down Dickinson.       Kimball Laundry.     Kimball Laundry was the -- laundry facilities.       They took the laundry facilities for 3 years, but there what they did is they went in and they took this building, you know, took the whole thing.       The problem with a flood is you don't take all the land.     You send some stuff in. And the stuff is there for a while, and then it comes back, and -- it's called water.     And so I don't know what to make of the cases like Kimball Laundry where you actually appropriate the property.     I suspect that they are not quite the same. Anything else?     I got Dickinson.     I've got Kimball Laundry.       Yes, Causby.       Yes, but in Causby, what they did -- there was a question about whether just flying some airplanes over is a taking or a trespass. But it went on for 25 years, so it was a long time. And, therefore, the permanency of it I don't think is at issue there.       But what do you suggest -- what do you suggest -- I looked at the consent.       To tell you the truth, I think it's permanent.     I think they're thinking it's intermittent, but permanently intermittent.       The flood comes like three months a year every year.     And the erosion, they say that part that's eroded belongs to the Government now. And if he comes back with his dirt and puts it in, that's fine, but he's trespassing on Government land. So if I'm right in reading that, if I'm right -- and a big if -- it seems that eleven cases somewhat stand for this, I agree, somewhat arbitrary rule. Now -- so I'm tempted, if I'm right, to say, okay, it's not perfect, but let's go with it.     There are people all over the country who have probably relied on this stuff.     And that would be so absent a better rule. So what do you suggest would be a better, clearer rule for compensating for flooding where our problem is what's a trespass and what's a taking?       You know, but I want to know what your idea -- I understand the difficulties are there --       -- and I'm willing to accept a lot you mentioned.       But what I'm asking -- which I just did ask -- is what's your idea of a substitute that would be better?       So a Department of the Interior employee trespasses on Jones's land, trampling paths, and even limbs fall off trees.     That's a taking and not a trespass?       Because?       So our department employee trying to find a shortcut drives his bulldozer through Jones's land knocking down his favorite redwood, it's a taking?
11-626 +++$+++        What about the -- I thought there was a -- a kind of caveat in one of these cases, maybe Stewart, that said take a thing that looks just like a boat, the Queen Mary, but if it is permanently -- they use the word "indefinite."     I think they mean "permanently."       But if it is permanently moored to the shore and is never going to sea again, then it isn't a vessel.       Then if the Polynesian boat is permanently in the museum, there's a lot of objective evidence of that, it would not be a vessel.     But if it's something they really could well take out on the sea, then it is, is that right?       That doesn't come up here. That concerns the Queen Mary being sent to Long Beach and used as a hotel.
11-681 +++$+++    When you come back, I'd appreciate your thinking about this, but obviously, you're asking us to overturn a case that's been the law for 35 years. I count hundreds of citations in the opinion, and I guess there are millions of instances in which employees and employers and others have relied on it in collective bargaining, so I'd appreciate your saying sentence a or two of why we should upset reasonable expectations over so long a period of time.   I suspect you're going to answer my question, so I want to focus it -- and I'm sorry to do this, but I think it's important. All right. I suspect you cannot answer my question about reliance without accepting one of the following three propositions: First, unlike every other employee, government employees have no right to organize. Or, second, they have a right to organize, but they cannot bargain about wages, working conditions and hours, unlike any other, that's the same as the first. Or, third, the courts of the United States are going to fashion, using the First Amendment as their weapon, a new special labor law for government employees. And I'd remind you we have some experience on that in the 1930s, where courts tried to do something analogous. All right. Now, answer my question about reliance.
11-697 +++$+++        But you don't have to say -- you can say both, either it was manufactured directly and received an American copyright and satisfied all the conditions, or, if that wasn't the case, it was manufactured in a way that satisfied the conditions of the American statute, even though, for technical reasons, it didn't apply.       That's what your argument is, I take it.       So we are off on a kind of curly cue here.       I take it that the reason they wrote -- or changed the statute was just because they were worried about bailees or lessees or somebody under the old statutes not satisfying the first -- they were worried about that -- somebody -- a printer lawfully obtains a book, and he shouldn't have advantage of the First Sale Doctrine.       He's in the middle of printing it.     And therefore you have to change the language.     So they changed the language to "lawfully made under this title."       Am I right; or, if I am wrong, why did they change it?       I couldn't find a word.     I could not find a word of that in the legislative history.     Irwin Karp, who was the strongest representative for the publishers, said you couldn't do that ten years earlier. So is there --       No, but you just said yes in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question.     So she'll find exactly what there is there, so I would like to know what it is.
11-702 +++$+++        I -- I see that.     There's something I really don't understand in these cases because the other cases, our precedent's been around a long time, so I would have guessed that, under that precedent in these other statutes, the obvious thing to do -- the obvious puzzle here is not the Federal statute, it's the State statute, what is this thing he was convicted of about? So you'd pick up the phone, and you'd phone, at random, four U.S. attorneys -- not U.S. attorneys, but four State attorneys --       -- who work with the statute in Georgia, and say, now, look, the indictment here says possession with intent to distribute, and I can show from the documents that it's a tiny amount. Now, is it your policy, if he was selling it, to charge under the sell?     Is it your policy if he's not selling it to charge under intent to distribute?     Is it totally random whether you say sell or intent to distribute? What's your policy?     Okay? Then we get some answers.     Then we'd have an idea whether what you're saying is right.     Now, you could do that, but they could do it, too.     Anyone could do it.     And then we'd have some actual facts about whether this charge -- really, it corresponds to the misdemeanor or the felony in the Federal statute. So why -- I'm not -- I mean, that isn't a brain -- that isn't -- doesn't require -- it's not rocket science, okay?     So why has no one done it?       You don't have to say, "never."     The question is what kind of a statute is this State statute?       And the kind of statute that it is, is a statute that is used to prosecute people --       -- with small amounts when they don't sell.       If your version of what that felon intends to distribute --       The distinction there is really picked up by the district attorneys. And if it's not, then they may be right, because -- because then intent to distribute may well often include, as it does under Federal law, people who sell stuff.       Okay.     Okay.     You didn't. In any words, nobody did it. So my other question --       -- which is the only other one I really have, aside from making that suggestion. But here, what happened to this person?       He was -- was he sentenced under 16-13-2(a)?     That is, was he sentenced to probation?     Which would be evidence in your favor, I think.       But was he, or wasn't he?       All right.     If he was, what it says in this provision is that the Court may without entering a judgment of guilt.     So there was no judgment of guilt.       And it says, if he completes it, he then is discharged without court adjudication of guilt.       And -- and shall not be deemed a conviction, it says for purposes of this code.       Well, why are we saying he was convicted of anything?       So you're thinking, under Georgia law, this is punishable as a felony only if it wasn't a small amount used for personal use, you see, and therefore, they go into the hearing. It's not punishable as an 841 felony, unless those two things are absent, and therefore, they have the hearing to find out.     And the word "punishable" doesn't appear in the statutes, the other ones that we've construed.     That's what I thought they were doing.
11-713 +++$+++        That's what they said they're doing.     I mean, I count in the -- about eight times in the house plan, the State house plan, and several times in the senate plan where it's clear, and I think it's fairly clear in the U.S. House plan, they say things like:     "The court began by considering the uncontested districts from the enacted plan that embraced neutral districting principles, although it wasn't required to give any deference."     And you say they're wrong about that.     "The court attempted to embrace as many of the uncontested districts as possible." So, after I got finished reading their opinions, I thought, well, there may be a difference between what you say and they say, but I'm not sure that there is a difference that's reflected in the maps. And so, it's now January 9th.     We have to have something in effect by February 1st.     They said that they're paying attention to what the legislature did.     And when I looked at the maps, as far as I can tell, they include -- some more, some less, most in the State senate -- but they include a lot of the State's changes. So, what am I supposed to do?     I mean, I can't tell whether you're right or wrong without looking district by district by district by district.     What am I supposed to do on January 9th?       In which -- in which --       Okay.     El Paso County in the original plan I guess was -- like number 16.     I've got it in front of me.     And they split it, and it was split somewhat differently or not.     Okay.       No, no, right.     It's a whole --       Yes.       Yes.     Correct.       So -- all right.     All right.     Now, why was that wrong?     Why is that wrong? Tell me why it's wrong for them to do that.       No, no, I didn't say that. I said, in their way of thinking, they are taking the map into account.     Now, to sit -- the enacted one.     If I disagree with that, I can't disagree at the level of principle; I have to disagree at the level of particular districts.     That's why I asked you the question.     So, you point to district 16, and I say, very well, tell me what they did wrong and why?     Because, remember, they are facing a challenge that's based on section 5, part purpose. And the district court there said, in the D.C., you don't survive -- I can't give you a summary judgment on that; purpose here may have been violated. All right.     Now, you tell me what's wrong with district 16, which I guess is your strongest case. That would be helpful.       Tell me -- tell me what's the problem?       What they said they were doing.     They couldn't have lost sight at the level of generality because at the level of generality they said we're trying to take into account the map.     I'm just repeating myself. I want to know what is wrong with the drawing of district 16, what they did, given that there's a section 5 challenge based on purpose?
11-770 +++$+++        What is the actual difference?     I mean, you have two officers or three.     If they go into the property and somebody's there, they can detain him, and Summers gives three reasons:     One, as Justice Kagan pointed out, preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found.     We are considering now the case where, instead of going and detaining the people, the people inside the house walk out and there are two officers in a patrol car or an unmarked car outside waiting to go in.     Okay.     That seems to me identical, as you said. The last one is facilitating orderly completion of the search.     That seems to me identical. You want the person there so that he can open a drawer, so he can unlock a closet, et cetera, okay.     Identical. The third one, where there is the only place for difference, it seems to me, is minimizing the risk of harm to the officers.     Now, the harm, risk of harm to the officers I guess if he goes into the house is that, well, if they leave, they might come back, goodness knows, and they've seen they are looking for the drugs, da, da, da.     Or maybe they will rush out, or maybe there will be a -- well, any, goodness knows what. Now here I can see a slight difference, but maybe not.     I don't know.     Maybe they will come back. Maybe they noticed the people in the car outside.     Maybe they didn't.     Certainly the policemen don't know.     And they might go in quicker, and then the others will be alerted.     I mean, when you talk generally about a risk of harm to the police, it seems to me pretty close, if not identical.       So what am I missing?       You already said the first one's identical.     I don't see how the third one could change, and what about the second?       How do you know that?     They are sitting outside in the car.       It's not just that.     It's that they might want to get in quicker to stop this person from leaving because he's the one who knows where the drugs are.     At least that's what they think.     Or they start to shout, and alert the others.     Or -- I mean, I have never conducted such a search, you know, so I don't know the risks involved there, but I can see the possibilities.     And probably you might have conducted them, but I don't know.     So how am I supposed to answer this question?       But that's the problem.       That's the problem.     The police have to know what they're supposed to do when they go in to search a house, all right?     And they know that sometimes they can keep the people there, and you are saying, but they can't stop them from leaving if they're not -- all of a sudden, I'm a policeman, and I don't know what to do exactly because I don't know how to fill in that blank.     And therefore, I might rush in -- I don't know -- I see a recipe for a mess, and that's what -- and the mess could involve physical harm, and --       They can't stop them from leaving if, blank.
11-796 +++$+++        So we are talking here -- he can do what he wants with the first generation. Anything he wants.     And moreover, when he buys them from Monsanto, he can make new seeds.     He can make generation 2 because they've licensed him to do it. Here, he buys generation 2.     Now, he can do what he wants with those seeds.     But I'll tell you, there is a problem because the coming about of the third generation is itself the infringement.     So the second generation seeds have nothing to do with it.     If he went into a room and had a box that he bought from a lab and he put rocks in it and he said, hocus-pocus and lo and behold out came the third generation of seeds, he would have infringed Monsanto's patent with that third generation, would he not?       No, he wouldn't have?     You mean if he goes and finds a new way of making these seeds, which happens to do with you pick some grass and you intertwine it and various things like that, and lo and behold you have a perfect copy of Monsanto's patented seed, he hasn't made it, he hasn't infringed?     Why not?       My question is the same with the grass as with the magic box.     I am saying the problem for you here, I think, is that, infringement lies in the fact that he made generation three.     It has nothing to do with generation 2.     That has just a coincidence.     But that is, in fact, the way he made these seeds.     But he can sell, resell generation 2, he can do whatever he wants with it. If he sterilizes it and uses them in a circus, he can do it.     The only thing he cannot do is he cannot create generation 3, just as he couldn't use generation 2 seeds to rob a bank. You know, there are certain things that the law prohibits.     What it prohibits here is making a copy of the patented invention.     And that is what he did.     So it's generation 3 that concerns us.     And that's the end of it. Now, what is your response to that?       I'm still not getting the answer.     I'm going to try once more.     Now, when you buy generation 2, well, there are a lot of things you can do with it.     You can feed it to animals, you can feed it to your family, make tofu turkeys.     I mean, you know, there are a lot of things you can do with it, alright. But I'll give you two that you can't do. One, you can't pick up those seeds that you've just bought and throw them in a child's face.     You can't do that because there's a law that says you can't do it. Now, there's another law that says you cannot make copies of a patented invention.     And that law you have violated when you use it to make generation 3, just as you have violated the law against assault were you to use it to commit an assault. Now, I think that's what the Federal Circuit is trying to get at.     And so it really has nothing to do with the Exhaustion Doctrine.     It has to do with some other doctrine, perhaps, that -- that somehow you think should give you the right to use something that has as a basic purpose making a copy of itself.     Maybe you should, but I don't see that.     Where is that in the law?       Yes.       Is that there?     Is that -- is that there in the Exhaustion Doctrine?       That's true, but that's what I thought you were going to respond.     I thought you were going to respond to me that my question then makes it infringement when your client buys generation 1 from Monsanto because they buy generation 1 from Monsanto, they plant it in the ground and lo and behold up comes generation 2.     And generation 2, on the basis of what I was asking you, is just as much a violation. But I think, though I'll find out from them, that the response of that is, yes, you're right, it is just as much of a violation.     That's why we, Monsanto, give the buyer a license to do it. And so it all seems to work out.     You don't need any exception.     There's no exception from anything. When you create a new generation, you have made a patented item, which you cannot do without the approval of the patent owner.     Therefore, Monsanto gives that approval when you buy generation 1. Now, it seems to me all to work out without any need for exception.     And I'm putting to you my whole thought so that you can respond to it.       Don't people or animals eat them?       Well, then why is it the only way you can do is to plant them?     That isn't the only thing you could do with it.       You can go buy them in the grain elevator and sell them for other things.       The invented product.     The invented thing.     The invented aspect of the seed is it has a gene in it that repels some other insecticide or something that they have.     I understand that.       You don't use that.     I don't think they used that particular -- well, go ahead. You go ahead.       The people buying from grain elevators are mostly people who take these chips -- whatever they are, the seeds -- and they sell them for making tofu, they sell them to eat, or this -- there are loads of uses, aren't there?
11-798 +++$+++        Can I make a somewhat -- this is how I'm seeing the case and there is some mystery in it to me and it would affect how I might write this thing or consider it. Look, what they want to do is to not have trucks park in the neighborhood on the street, and they want to put a tag on it.     All right.     So the second -- you seem to have said what they should have done.     You go to the NTSB and you ask, and they do it.     They approve it or they don't. And their -- their problem is that they Page 17 don't want 40 or 50 States each saying a different sticker, all right?     So then the whole back fills up with stickers and that's the problem.     That's the problem.     You go explain, et cetera, okay. But the first part, the parking, it seemed to me of course they should be able to do that.     And there seems to me to be a tailor-made exception, the authority of the State to impose highway route controls or limitations.     And if that isn't tailor-made for this, I don't know what is, I mean, I don't know what it's doing there.     And so why has nobody done that? When I read the lower court on that, they said, oh, it affects fares and it affects services. Every route restriction affects fares and services, you know?     So here I see an exception which seems tailor-made for what they want to do.     I see all kinds of problems with the proprietary thing.     What am I supposed to do?     What -- what I see as the exception tailor-made for this isn't in the case.       So what do you suggest? And it's a question for both sides.       I mean, you can't say, don't drive our truck through the neighborhood?     This is residential area, no trucks over such-and-such.     If you can say that, why can't you say do it part of the time? Why can't you say -- we're arguing a different question. I agree it is not --       But wait.     Why isn't the -- I mean, I thought that the purpose of these exceptions -- of course cities can have parking regulations.     Of course States and cities can have regulations involving trucks as to how and where they Page 26 use the highways and which ones they can't use and which routes, et cetera.     That's the purpose of that exception, isn't it?     I mean, I -- I thought that's what it was. And, of course, you're quite right in saying they should have to do it uniformly.     It says it based on size and weight.     Okay.     Fine.     What's the problem with that, that I'm not seeing?       No, no, it says, "The authority of a state to impose highway route controls or limitations based on the size and weight of the motor vehicle or the -- or hazard -- or hazardous nature." And it's size and weight, hazardous nature.     I mean, isn't there room in those words to include environmental consideration?
11-817 +++$+++ 
11-820 +++$+++        How many had?       How many had?     I mean, I would have thought it was common sense that a lawyer should tell the client the terrible things that are going to happen to him if he pleads guilty, those things that the lawyer knows or should know about and the client may not.     Alright.     That's a very general rule at that level. But some courts have said, no, that isn't true.     That isn't true unless -- if it's -- as Justice Kagan said, if it's a collateral exception, if it's a collateral consequence.     How many had?     Was it only Kentucky, or was it fairly widespread, this exception?       Well, there aren't that many.     There are eleven, and two of them are specialized.
11-864 +++$+++        Well, I completely agree with hornbook law.     Three pipe manufacturers get together and, in January, fix their prices, all right?       Fourteen wholesalers want to show that, and each has different damages because they bought different amounts of pipe.       Hornbook law class and leave the damages issues for later.       This case, this case, hornbook law:     Section 2 forbids monopolization.     It is absolutely clear Comcast has that power.     That's why they're -- that's why they're regulated.     And, indeed, they engage in things that show that they did not achieve that through skill, foresight, and industry. What things?     And now, we have a list of four.     And the district court says exactly what?     If we prove monopolization, which is relevant to all these people in the class, then what we do is we later look into how much that monopolization raised the prices above competitive levels.     And I offer a model to look at the competitive levels and look at what happened over here, and there we are, it will help.     Okay? Now, hornbook law, whether that's so or not so is a matter for later, but see first if there is liability.     Okay.     That's their argument.     What's the answer?       Well, here, since what they are saying is they have two theories, Section 1, the agreements to keep other people out of this area are unlawful in themselves.     Question 2 is whether they contribute to monopolization.     Okay?       Now, that's the legal issue of liability.     Now, if they're right, why isn't the measure of damages just what you said?     We look to the people who are subject to the monopoly power, and we work out how much above the competitive level they had to pay.       Some paid some; some paid another.     We have some experts in to try to make that computation.     Sounds the same to me.       I saw the four theories, and it seems to me that we are now on the theory of the -- one of the pieces of exclusionary conduct was agreement through various mergers, et cetera, that potential competitors would not come in and compete. Now, I don't know why the judge struck out the other one, the number 2.     But number 3 and Number 4, I can see it.     But on monopolization theory, that's not relevant to damages.     Throughout, we assume that the regulator is doing a terrible job; otherwise, the prices wouldn't be so high in the first place. But what's the difference in this case? I just didn't hear it, and I put that to show you how it seemed to me there is very similar.     The difference --       Is?       That's -- I mean, that's liability.       You have the right to prove that they weren't, fine.       And this does, too -       But on -- on -- to what extent did the failure of competition from those people raise price above the competitive level?       And if --       -- how is it different from the pipes --       No, you shouldn't.       Is that right?     Is that what Learned Hand said?     Is -- is that what Alcoa holds? Is that United Fruit holds when they bomb their competitor's ship and achieve monopolization?     That the only people who can get damages are the people who run the ship and were bombed --       -- who bought those bananas?     I didn't know that.     But besides, if you're right, which I tend to doubt, but I'll look it up, if you're right --       Yes, all right.     Fine. I'll look that up.     If you're right and as they pointed out, it's still one of the easiest things in the world to simply change the base for this model.     Instead of the base being those businesses or homeowners who received their service at competitive prices, we say -- we modify it by including those who received services where DBS was involved, and that'll be a higher price, and we subtract that price from the price they paid where there was overbuilding threatened. Now, that'll be a new number.     They say it was a new number.     And I think anybody running a model could do that, but I promise you, I don't know.     And to know whether you're right on that, or they're right, I will have to get into the model-building business, where I am not an expert.
11-88 +++$+++        Why isnt the place --       The -- the word "persons" -- when was there -- I found lots and lots of instances and by people in the civil -- international civil rights community who are testifying, where I look at what they say, and over and over they say a limited statute, the person won't often be in the United States.     Well, the PLO had a presence in the United States.     The person won't be in the United States very often.     I know, but sometimes he may come over here; it's important to take a -- make a symbolic step.     And not a word could I find, when they're talking even about the word "person," that suggested they meant even the PLO at that time.     In fact, they thought, well, it would be a nice thing, but, but, but, but....       I mean, that's the tenor of what I seem to have found so far.     So, I mention that because you will point out to me the things that I have accidentally skipped. (Laughter.)       Maybe they did.     You see, I might as well be honest with you, page 26 of the Government's brief did have an impact on my thinking. It's Father Drinan, and Father Drinan says in the hearing, "I think it would be best to stay with that and just avoid all of the problems about the PLO and related groups."     And then Michael Posner testifies, it says, the Government, to the same effect. So, there the great advocates of this thing are sitting there saying we don't think it should cover the PLO; let's not take that step at this time.       I mean -- and you have Congressman Leach, and you have the word "individual."       Yes, but he's taking that --       He's taking that -- oh, go ahead.       Oh, the obvious thing which again they said is, look, just -- this is going to bring in suits against the Palestinian Authority.     That's a very touchy issue in foreign affairs, and we don't want to have to go that far.     And some of the things that are said seem to bear that out.     That's -- that's what's pulling --
11-889 +++$+++        It doesn't say that.     It says, "No State is entitled to more than 25 percent." It doesn't say -- I mean that language doesn't say what happens if in fact there's a State that because of cliffs or something can't get the 25 percent to which it is entitled.     It just doesn't say anything about it.       Where does it say something about it?       Yes.       All right.     Does that mean that a State can, when it can't get its pipeline to the river, go into some other State and take the water out of that other State?     I mean, I would have thought, if that was their intent, there would be a mechanism for doing it.     That you'd have some authority set up by the Compact that would decide where, whether it's really true, and how are we supposed to do it, and there is no such mechanism, rather if there is such a right, which it doesn't say anything about, it's left to the State courts in different States to try to do what is an extremely complex and controversial administrative job.       It's not at all complex when Oklahoma is going to say, Texas, go run the pipe to the south of the Red River, and Texas is going to say, I'm sorry, we can't get there, there's too much cactus. And then they're going to say, don't you know that, in fact, when you put your pipeline into Oklahoma, you are going to be taking part of the 25 percent that belongs to us. And Texas will say, no, we aren't.     And then we'll have to have a way of measuring how much goes into the river at different places and what are all these different pipelines are going to take out.     You understand what I'm saying.       I would have thought a mechanism would be set up to do that and there is none.       Fine.     But they do say expressly, and I don't know what the terrain is like in the other areas.     And here it does not say anything about it.     That's why I think we're here in the Court because all it says is you can't take more than percent.     It doesn't say what happens when Texas is unable to get its 25 percent from the south.     I'm now repeating myself, but you point to the language that says what I just say is not consistent with the language.       Which language is it not consistent with?       Go back to the first one because what you have done is you've pushed me back to the equal rights.     And now if I am going to fight you on it, I have to say the equal rights to water means equal rights to water arising within its boundaries.     And all you have to say is equal rights to water arising anywhere in the subbasin. And if I just heard that, then I might say okay, I think yours is a little better.     But -- but we have this enormous administrative mess that would seem to be created, and both those interpretations seem possible. So let's go back to that and let me hear quite clearly, now that I've focused it, what's the answer?       Well, we're only considering the instance where there isn't enough water to meet the 25 percent in Texas.     And in that instance, I guess there are 50,000 places, not just in Oklahoma, but also in Arkansas, where they might get some. And all my question, and I think that was being asked, is there anything else you want to say as to why that's an easy matter to decide?
11-8976 +++$+++        What is -- is there any -- I'm trying to find an analogous instance without the statute of limitations.     And what occurred to me, just as an example, that you might have in your practice found a different one, the Thomas Crown Affair.     Say that he robs the bank or the art museum, but he has an intent to return it, and he produces evidence that he had an intent to return. Now, in such a case, once he produces the evidence, does the government have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he didn't have an intent to return?     Or does he -- is there any instance in which the burden of persuasion shifts?     Do you see what I'm driving at?       So you have never found a case -- I will ask the government this -- in the substantive criminal law, no matter what, who is -- even if the defendant is the only one ever likely to know anything about it, you've never found a case where, once the burden's produced, the -- the burden of persuasion remains on the defendant?       Yes, because you agree the defendant has the burden of production here.       And so I was trying to think of some instance -- as I said, I would be repeating myself -- I'm looking for any instance in which, leaving the statute of limitations out of it, the burden of persuasion shifts to the defendant.     So I'm saying, did you ever find one?     The Thomas Crown Affair or some other instance, and your answer is, no, you never have heard of it.       Have you heard of it?     So what?       Well, this is not -- this does not negate the elements of the defense -- this does not negate the elements of the crime.       All right.     Well, then if that's so, if it's an affirmative defense and if sometimes where it doesn't negate the elements of the crime the burden of persuasion remains on the defendant, then why shouldn't it here?     Because he's the one most likely to know.       And how do you prove it?       They often do.     I just want to go back, get the complete -- insofar as you can help with this. All right.     Let's take duress or self-defense.     The government shows all the elements of murder.     Then the defendant comes in and says, I have evidence here that it was under duress or evidence that it was self-defense.     Then to prevail, what's the standard of persuasion?     How does it work? Is it then that -- is it that the defendant must show more likely than not?     Or is it the defend -- that I was defending myself?     Or is it that the government -- how does it work?     What's the rule?       Yes, of course.     Of course.       Yes, yes.       All right.     Well, that's -- well, then their point is, well, this is awfully similar.       The fact that there is a statute of limitations makes your case weaker, not stronger, because -- because the statute of limitations is less directly connected to the elements of the -- the offense than is self-defense or duress.       Your -- I'm sorry.     The Thomas Crown Affair again, all the evidence shows he took $10,000 from the bank.     He testifies and says, oh, I was going to give it back, okay?     The prosecution puts on nothing.     The jury says, are you kidding?       Okay.
11-9307 +++$+++        I want to go back to Justice Alito's question for a moment because I thought -- and Justice Scalia.     I thought, in your brief, you -- you said that their point's a good point. Their point is that the system works in a way that requires the lawyer to object at the trial.     Alright. And that is an efficiency because the trial judge has to -- has to correct -- he has to -- has an opportunity to correct mistakes.     He can't be sandbagged. But, you said, that's theoretically always true, but, in your case, as a practical matter, it's really never true because no lawyer is ever going to think, oh, I would object, but I'm not going to object because maybe the law will become clarified by the Supreme Court, and I'll be able to get a plain error thing on appeal.     The lawyer who thought that is like the unicorn, he doesn't really exist. (Laughter.) Okay.     And you then said, on the other hand, theres an efficiency on the other side.     The efficiency on the other side is if you don't take your rule, when you get to the court of appeals, you're going to have to decide in real cases whether the law was so clear that the plain error doctrine still does apply at the trial level before.     Either it was clear that the judge was wrong, or it was clear the judge was right, and there is no point to objecting. So now we have to decide, was he clearly wrong, was he clearly right, or was it a middle case. And when you get to real legal cases that have tough issues, you discover that that's a hard question to ask -- answer case by case, court by court.     Now, didn't you say all that?       Okay.     Well, then why didn't I hear you say it again.       So you can -- if you lose, you can't get through the door.     If you win, you then have to go on to the next part of it, which says, did the error affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. So if all that's at stake is a resentencing, not much harm is done, and you're more likely to satisfy the fourth.       If what's at stake is a whole new trial and everything, it's probably a little bit harder to satisfy that prong. So it's possible to build what Justice Kennedy was referring to into the present rule, isn't it?
11-9335 +++$+++ 
11-94 +++$+++        I didn't think --       I mean, I was -- I tend to be in dissent in these cases; so, I don't have the authoritative view.     But the --       What?       Well, but no.     But the impression I have is that -- that I had thought there were what I'd call the elements of the offense, and then there were sentencing facts.     And sentencing facts have been traditionally facts found by the judge when imposing a sentence. Now, the majority of the Court in Apprendi went back into the history and said there is no significant old tradition, old enough, of -- of sentencing facts.     So, really, when you raise the sentence, that's like an element, and you should have a jury trial. Now, the argument here, one of them, that the government stresses -- and Ice is the same -- is that there is no -- the tradition's different where fines and where multiple and concurrent sentences were at issue. If you go back to the 18th century or earlier, what you'll discover is that the judge has always had a much greater role in deciding what the amount of a fine should be.     And, therefore, insofar as that amount rested upon some view of the facts as to the manner in which the crime occurred -- and it always does -- it was the judge who traditionally found it, not the jury.     So, those facts are not like elements of the crime. That's what I thought was essentially the argument.     Ice and fines are on one side of that line, and Apprendi is on the other.       No, no.     They're not doing that here.     What they're deciding is a fact of sentencing is how often this crime was committed.     No one can go against the statutory limit, but rather it -- it allows a higher sentence when certain facts occur. Now, I thought in Apprendi that the history is just what I'm saying it was in -- in the fine case, but the majority says to the contrary.     And so, here it seems, even if I was wrong in Apprendi, that at least there's enough discretion here to say, look, this is traditionally up to the judge.     Now, why do you think that isn't so?       My goodness, I think there's lots of statutes that say something like this: That within limits, if there's a particular --       Yes, leave that out because we assume -- right.       It says, the fine, the maximum fine is going to be "not more than the greater of twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss."       Now, you're going to send that to the jury.     Let me read you the next phase -- phrase:     "unless imposition of a fine under this subsection would unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing process." I point to that next phrase to show you that Congress understands, in an antitrust case, in a RICO case, in a corruption case of different kinds, in an environmental case, it is so complicated figuring out that kinds of things that they excuse even the judge who's experienced in this from dealing with that.     And under your theory, as you just point out, if Apprendi applies here, we're suddenly telling juries to -- they have to under the Constitution administer that section U.S.C. 3571, which I just read to you.       No, I understand you could say that's what the Constitution provides, and if you jury can't handle it, well, too bad.     Okay.     But I think we're still in the business of trying to decide whether the Constitution does provide that in the case of fines.       Is that a tail?     Is that a tail that the jury proceeding is itself so unadministrable that even Congress says we recognize even a judge couldn't do it?     All right?       Now, is that --       Is that an irrelevant consideration when you are trying to figure out whether an ambiguous history requires the jury trial?       How is that supposed to work?     Do you have two juries?
11-9540 +++$+++        The problem is there's no way.     This is purely conceptual.     A State supreme court that says the word "weapon" in the statute means knife, ax, or gun.     Now, are those three ways of committing the crime?     Or are they three crimes, each with a separate element?     That is -- we'd need not only St. Thomas Aquinas, but I mean, we'd need those angels dancing on the head of a pin. There is no difference that I can imagine. And therefore you are saying, look to the point of this statute; it is not to look to the individual way in which it was committed, and therefore go to the statute to see whether you have a single crime or separate crimes, okay?     That's that's what I think your argument is.       Do you think I understand your argument?       -- because what I want to do next is say, why are we debating this point, because the only difference I can see under the California statute is shoplifting and even that one is sort of debatable.     And the very next clause of this statute says "or otherwise," "or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury." So, why not forget about this metaphysical point and say, look, even if you are totally right, you've still got a statute that for 430,000 convictions and as far as we can tell there must have been fewer than 500 that involved shoplifting, so this is so much like burglary, that whatever risks were presented by burglary are surely present here.     So let's forget the metaphysics and just go on to clause 2.     Now, why hasn't anybody done that?     It's a mystery to me, because you haven't and they haven't.     So why not?       Why?       No, no, no.     But I mean, what I would do -- I've said this and nobody pays any attention.     I think Justice Scalia's said it; nobody pays any attention.     I think Justice Posner said it.     He said, look, under clause 2, these are really empirical questions, is this dangerous or not.     Let's do a little sampling and what we'll do is we'll sample the kinds of people that this particular State statute X get convicted under and where a whole lot of them are dangerous it's a dangerous statute; and where not, not. And so nobody's done that sampling, but we do have some numbers here and the numbers here suggest that this is really a burglary statute.       Yes, you could.     I just don't think there are that many people who burgle their own homes or who go into the home of somebody else with an invitation and then sneak into the cupboard and stay overnight and burgle everything.     I mean, there are some such, but --       No, no, no.     It doesn't have to do with that.     It has to do with the crime and the crime is the crime that the statute defines.     And the question is, is that crime otherwise -- present a serious potential risk of physical injury?     And if 4,000 manifestations of that crime it does, and 3 manifestations of that crime it doesn't, you would say the overall judgment here is this is a crime that does present that dangerous risk.     That's because in almost all cases it's there.       No, no.     It's exactly pure categorical.     You have a crime in a statute.     You don't know how dangerous it is.     It is not burglary, arson or explosives.     So to find out if it presents the same kind of danger you do a little empirical research.     That's all I'm saying.     It has nothing to do with categorical.       "Is burglary or otherwise," "or otherwise," "burglary or otherwise," and the reason we have "or otherwise" is because Congress does know that the number of State statutes that are sort of like something, but not completely like something is in the thousands.     And so that's why they put in "or otherwise."       Because it's like the old joke.     I mean, it's in the statute, you are looking back to see whether he was charged with possession of a gun, which is one word in the statute, or an ax, or a knife. That's what we're looking for under the categorical -- modified categorical.     But if all it says in the statute is weapon, even if the supreme court says it's a gun, a knife, or an ax, you still have nothing to look for. Because the charge to the jury could have been, did he have a gun, a knife, or an ax, and the answer to that question, when the jury comes back, would be yes.     You see? All they have to say is yes.     They don't have to say which.     And therefore, Apprendi would be violated, in your view.       You didn't.
11-965 +++$+++        So how do we deal with that?     That's what's -- I mean, it's in your interest to argue that -- tell me how to deal with this. It's perhaps true -- I think it's true that a State doesn't have to allow companies to have wholly-owned corporations.     Under the Constitution of the United States, nothing says they do.     Or a State could say, wholly-owned corporations?     Well, there's no limited liability.     Or they could say, in certain kinds of accidents, there's no limited -- et cetera.     You see, they have lots of choice. So what really seems to have been going on here is the Ninth Circuit, from your perspective, just really misstated California law by out to lunch.     When they say when we want it to be as broad as the Constitution, they don't mean, because we could get rid of limited liability, that that's what we do. So -- so how can we deal with a circuit court that seems to seriously misstate the law of a State?       I would like to know the chain of reasoning that gets - (Laughter.)
11-982 +++$+++        You're right, that's the standard.     And so you said that -- I mean, I feel perhaps more calmly about this than I might feel is warranted, but the -- the question is, is there anything here that you -- so you said, by definition, we're going to produce some new shoes, which new shoes are not -- do not have the appearance of any current and/or previous footwear product designs and any colorable imitations thereof. So I would like you to refer me to the record where your president of your client or somebody else says, we are intending to produce some new shoes that fall outside that definition, and of course, I will look at that, because your opponent says we can find no reasonable likelihood that they are going to produce anything or they have any present intent of showing -- of producing something that falls outside that definition. But now, you just said, oh, no, we're definitely going to.     So just refer me to those pages in the record that shows that because, of course, you win, if that's true.       Yes, but that isn't the point.     The point is, is the new footwear that you're designing footwear that is not -- does not have the appearance of any current or previous footwear product designs or any colorable imitation thereof?     And so to say you are in the business of producing new footwear, at least, to me, suggests nothing because the question is what the footwear looks like, not that you're producing new footwear.       No, I'm not interested in the real world.     I am interested in the record.       And does it show anything at all in respect that would support the claim that you are going to produce new footwear that doesn't either resemble, nor is a colorable imitation of anything that you have previously produced or is the subject of the case?       Period?       Okay.     So I take it that this case really boils down to should you have -- should they have or you both have another chance to say what the new footwear will be -- look like under a new standard, or is there enough here already to say, well, really, the judges could conclude that there is no real likelihood that you're going to produce something that won't look like what's already been produced.       But that look --     I mean, maybe you could suggest to me that I -- that we should change what the law has been or not follow it here, but where I'm taking the law from is Friends of the Earth.       And in Friends of the Earth, it says a defendant -- namely Nike -- claiming its voluntary compliance moots a case, and what they're claiming is that this -- a covenant moots the case, moots the case, the covenant they gave, there's the formidable burden -- you know, it's formidable, you're quite right -- of showing it is absolutely clear, correct, that the allegedly wrongful behavior, namely, their suing, but their suing in respect to this kind of shoe, could not reasonably be expected to recur. And they say, since we promised in an enforceable promise not to repeat this behavior ever -- 100 years, how could it be expected reasonably to recur? How could our behavior, namely suing for infringement in respect to a shoe like this, be reasonably expected to recur, given our covenant?     And your response to that is?       Okay.     So, look, how are you hurt then?     Because suppose he wins here.     Now, you, if you have the president of the company say, hey, I'm going to do an exact copy, go bring a -- go bring a cancellation action. If you can't quite say that -- you know, you can start one -- you can't quite say that, but he says something sort of vague about it that's close, go to the PTO.     And if he can't say anything like that at all, well, then, maybe you should lose.     I mean, that's -- that's -- what's the practical problem with that?
11-9953 +++$+++        Your -- your point of view in this case --       In your point of view, would it satisfy you if we say, the Louisiana court of appeal found the largest part of the delay involved the funding crisis experienced by the State of Louisiana -- that meant giving you adequate money for counsel. Then they said, the progression of the prosecution was out of the State's control, as determined by this court, which I think referred to that funding crisis.     And we could -- and your view would be that's what they said.     We don't know the underlying facts, but that's what they said. And, insofar as they said that the State wasn't responsible for that part of the delay that they are talking about, they're wrong because the State is responsible for not providing enough money, even if it's a problem and to say they weren't responsible is wrong, okay?     That's what you want us to say?       Period.     And send it back.       The answer to the question -- that's what I was trying to do -- this case -- the briefing is filled with whether he asked in time, whether he was delaying, whether he should have done some other thing, whether he should have -- but the question that's asked is, simply, whether the failure to fund counsel is a factor that should be weighed against the State.       And maybe it only gets very little weight because maybe there was a hurricane, and maybe it doesn't even matter because he didn't make the right motions.     But the lower court said it shouldn't be weighed against the State, period.     And do we have to do anything other than say, if you're right, yes, it should. Now, how much weight it gets, well, that depends.     There was a hurricane and -- but -- but it's something that they can't just ignore in -- in the hearing.     They have to figure out what happened and to -- to the extent the State should have done more, it weighs against the State. Do you want any more than that?       And what else?
12-10 +++$+++        Well -- well, on that particular point, what should we do -- as far as I can tell from the briefs, the people who work with the prostitutes to try to prevent AIDS uniformly tell us that, if you go to those prostitutes and you try to get them to take steps to stop AIDS, it's very hard to do if, at the same time, you've announced you're against all prostitution. So what they're saying is that the condition imposed will interfere with the objective, and if there is a germaneness requirement -- and nobody says the opposite.     I mean, I've noted nobody denies what they're saying in terms of the effectiveness of their work, so -- I don't think. At least, I didn't read them all with great care; maybe you can point to somebody who does.     But, if everyone is telling us that this is counterproductive and the exact opposite -- then can we say, well, it isn't germane?       Well, that's quite a few, yes.     That's true.       I see that, and I see you have two sides to the policy question.     And then it seems to me that the case that Justice Ginsburg was speaking of is pretty relevant.     Why?     Well, that case, Regan and League of Women Voters, all seem quite comparable. They are trying to balance the -- the desire of the government to further a policy objective with the undesirability of the government invading what would otherwise be a constitutional protected right to speech. And the way they have done it is quite technical and narrow, but it may be applicable.     In both, what they said was, don't worry about your protected speech as much as you are because there is another way you can do it here.     You go through a -- an independent structured organization.     And where that wasn't present, namely, the League of Women Voters, the Court struck it down. Now, if that's the right framework, then, here, I don't see how you could have an independently Page 17 structured organization for the reason that a group that said, I am -- I am opposed completely to prostitution, publicly, to get the money, and then set up a structure that said the opposite, would be seen as totally hypocritical.     They wouldn't be able to get their message across. They wouldn't be able to express, in any way, what it is they think about the -- the administration of AIDS in the context -- anti-AIDS in the context of prostitution. That's a long question, but you see where -- where I've ended up.       At the moment, for purposes of the question.     So why isn't this case more like League of Women Voters and less like the other two?       I wasn't excepting that one.       I was -- I mean, the main difference it seemed to me is, assuming all of that away, is that, here, the separate structure does not fulfill the constitutional need simply because the basic condition has to do with express speech, because when A says, I believe in X, and then they set up a separate structure -- and every one knows they have set it up; I mean, that's the point of it -- and the structure says, "just kidding," nobody believes them from day one. And so you can't do it, and, if the government has its way and has awarded the thing properly, according to your criteria, the part that won't be believed is the "just kidding" part.     And so the structure -- separate structure -- just doesn't work in terms of communicating their belief.     And I don't think that's true in Rust, and I don't think it's true in Regan, and I do think it's true in FCC v. League of Women Voters.       Boy, if -- if the structure -- the separate structure is not really part of a constitutional analysis, then the government could say, why not?     It's easy to find policy reasons, and really find very, very decent and thoughtful people who agree with the policy reason, you know? There -- there are people on both sides of these questions, and they come in and they say, okay, we're giving money for an anti-abortion purpose or a pro-abortion purpose, you know --       -- and -- and, suddenly, people can't say anything in these areas in face of such a condition.
12-1036 +++$+++       Can you tell me when you come back where the money goes if you win?      What he says is -- in the complaint, it says -- "prays that the defendant be ordered to restitute any and all moneys for the purchases of its citizens." All right.    Now, you look at the statute he quoted, the Mississippi statute, and it says there is the authority to have restitution to restore to any person in interest any moneys which may have been acquired by means of a practice prohibited. So he says that sounds as if what you're talking about is you want restitution, though, given to the State, the restitution is for individual purchases of individual citizens, because there could be no other. And, therefore, you have a list of people in mind, or you must find one, where there were particular individual purchases by individual citizens and get that restitution into the treasury. All right.    Now, that -- I think something like that was his argument, and I wanted to know what you were going to say.    Are you going to give up these last five words, "and the purchases of its citizens"?      Right.      Yes, and the purchases of its citizens.      I know they'll get the money -      -- but he's saying to get the money, you have to say which money.      And to get the money, which money means you better have a list of the individual people who bought something, or otherwise, there is no such money, and that's enough to make those in respect to this paragraph, individual people whose claims the State of Mississippi is pursuing.    Something like that is his argument.    And I just wanted to know your response.
12-1038 +++$+++ 
12-10882 +++$+++    Is that what you want? That is, I go back to Justice Sotomayor's question. Start monkeying around with 95 percent. It's all over the law. I mean, 95 percent is a classical measure by scientists of when they have confidence that the fact that the regression analysis seems to establish is in fact a fact.   That is in tort law. That is in whether jury trials are -- are discriminating because they don't have black people on the jury. It's all over the law. So I assume that we -- you're not asking us to muck around with that number because I don't know what the consequences would be. And if you're not, here's how we reduce it. You give the same test six times and now we've reduced it from 5 percent, if he's above 70 all the time, to maybe one -- one one-hundredth of one percent. Is that what you want to have happen?   Am I right? Am I right in what I said?   Okay.   No, no. Let's go before the last thing. (Laughter.)   I'm not saying it isn't important, but I want -- my thinking to the last thing is dependent on my being right on everything before the last thing. So am I right before the last thing, about how 95 percent --
12-1117 +++$+++ 
12-1128 +++$+++ 
12-1146 +++$+++    How does the -- this differ? I mean, there are many statutes, I believe, particularly in the regulatory area, where Congress passes a statute that tells the agency, do A, B, C and D. And then it turns out, since there's so many of the regulated things, that it just doesn't make sense to apply A, B and C and D to all of them. So often I would think courts read in an exception where it makes no sense. For example, if there were a statute that said you have to throw out all bubble gum that's been around for more than a month. Well, what about bubble gum used in a display case that nobody ever intends to eat? You see? And so what we do all the time is we say, well, it doesn't mean to apply to that. Now, why can't we take the same approach or EPA takes the same approach here? It says 250 tons or more and we apply that all over the place, except it doesn't make sense here, so we read an exception into it, unwritten, for places where it makes no sense?   So in your opinion -- is -- I'm not sure what the statutory cite is to the provision you are talking about. Is it 7411?   All right. So you're saying they could use 7411 (a) and (b) to get to just the same place they are today.   You don't see an objection. There must be some reason they didn't do that.   They are doing it? Well, then I don't know what this case is about. I mean, it's a guestion of whether they do exactly the same thing under one provision or another provision. And you agree with them that they could do it under the other one and we'd end up at exactly the same place.   It says, "such standards with such modifications as he deems appropriate." That's the language of 7411(b).   Okay. So if this is the right program, why couldn't they copy it word for word into the rules and just put a different section number at the bottom? I know you'd have a preferred way to do it, but if they disagreed with you and they think this is the perfect program, why can't they do it?   But that's a difficult  I think where Justice Kagan is going -- and I will if she wasn't, but I think she was -- is put the definition from 7479 in your mind. That means something to you, right? You know what I'm talking about.   Of the major emitting facility.   Okay. Now, we look at 7475, and it says you have to have a permit and use Best Available Control Technology. For what? And then we go to the definition, and it says, among other things, "For any source with the potential to emit 250 tons per year or more of any pollutant." Now, that doesn't -- my God, that maybe means every 500 people, every school is applied here. So you say we've got to do something about this statute because they don't really mean to every football game they're going to have a permit, or it doesn't mean every 500 people, like all of my relatives are together, they have to have a permit. No, it can't mean that. So we have two choices. Choice A, which is what you would like, is it means any air pollutant, any regulated air pollutant, but not greenhouse gases. Okay. That's choice one. Choice two is it means any air pollutant including greenhouse gases, but implicitly EPA has the authority to exempt small emitters. You see? Now, which does the less violence to the statute?   I knew you would say that. (Laughter.)   All right. So let me modify my guestion. I get that answer on the language there. But if you had been sitting in Congress and the Senate, Mr. Billings, I think, is the staff person, Senator Muskie, and suppose that you had this choice put to you with your language. We'd either like to have the authority implicit here to exempt the football team, the tiny emitters, or we'd like it not to cover it at all. Which do you think the Senate would have chosen in enacting this bill from the evidence in the language itself, in the evidence which I look at, the history of the bill?   All right. If you can narrow it, why not narrow that one? Any air pollutant, including greenhouse gases, to the extent that they can be sensibly controlled under this statute. Now I've worked with the words "air pollutant." You see, I can do it any way you want if I'm prepared to read in exceptions. And, of course, we do have exceptions when agencies enforce statutes. We do have exceptions from general language all the time.   It can, though. It can in large guality -- guantities. I mean, you don't see anything wrong with large guantities. It's just the small guantities you have a problem with.   I mean, are you saying it doesn't make sense to control major emitters of C02?
12-1163 +++$+++ 
12-1168 +++$+++    How far do you want to go in your concession? Would you want to concede this point that imagine the State has two groups of people and one group feels what the other is doing is terribly wrong. And the second group feels, We absolutely want to do it. And everyone is in a fragile state of mind, and they want to, if possible, at least one group wants to sort of shout as loud as you could at the other, Please don't do this. And the other says, Please leave me alone. And we are not saying which group is which; the analogy is obvious, but I keep all the titles out. Does the State have the right, in your opinion, to say, It's tough to referee this, we see the potential for real harm on one side or the other, so we're going to have this kind of 35-foot boundary? You want to concede that and say, okay, but the evidence here didn't doesn't justify it, or do you want to fight that, too?   But now you are into the details. I want to know about the principle. I mean, I can imagine the principle applying special care and need must be taken outside of hospitals for veterans, even though there are some who are very much opposed to the war, because these people are gonna be coming out, they'll be in wheelchairs, it will be terrible. And others thinking -- you know, we can think of many, many situations, irrespective subject matter, where there is a need for such refereeing. And I just want to know if the -- if the concept is okay with you or if not.   With the details.   Do you see now why I am trying to narrow it? Because in my case, in Schneider, I thought it was pretty important that the demonstrators were behind a hill somewhere and the police restricted where they can go. Many States have enacted similar laws, and I thought that's important, because maybe it would have come out differently. I mean, you could argue that, I could. So I'm trying to narrow it. I'm trying to see to what extent do I have to look at this particular set of facts, in which case we are into the hearings, et cetera; and to what extent is there a matter of very broad principle here, and any help you can give me on that would be appreciated.   Okay. So that -- now, at this point -- that was a better way of getting what I was trying to get at. Just assume that there is -- let's look at the narrow part of the case, and let's assume that the Colorado case is right. And this particular restriction is more a restrictive than Colorado in two important respects, which you've gone into. Now, the reason that they did that is they had hearings in Massachusetts, and they discovered that the Colorado law didn't really work very well. And so, what are we supposed to do? Are we supposed to now go look at -- as long as those hearings are -- are legitimate hearings and they have good explanation on something like whether the zone is 8 feet and consensual or whether it's 35 feet and different amounts of sidewalk, depending on the nearness of the facility, when doesn't it become just up to them? We can't -- we're not legislators. We don't know the situation in Massachusetts. We can insist upon a reasonable record. But how can we do more than that on this detail?   But you understand that. We all understand that. It's one thing to try to prove an intent on such matters, particularly when people are, in good faith, they're trying to explain it, and it's another thing to actually stop the congestion and to protect the interests of the woman who wants to have the abortion, may be in a fragile state of mind, and this kind of thing could interfere with her health, et cetera. So there are two interests, one on each side. We know 8 feet with the bubble is okay. We're not sure about 35 feet, and they have an evidentiary record.   That's why I just asked you that guestion. It just happens that the police testify with some evidence and examples that the 8-foot bubble doesn't work. And it also -- they have some evidence and reasons for thinking that if you want to have a conversation, you have to convince the woman to walk 10 feet. I mean, the difference is about half -- you know, if you were near me, Price is near we have Colorado. If we're over to where the first row is, we'd have Massachusetts, and -- and they have some evidence that we can't enforce this Colorado thing very well; it doesn't help. Now, go ahead. I want your answer.   I'm not trying to put words --   I'd hear you.   I'm not denying the difference.   I am asking you, we've now heard different characterizations of the record. I didn't mean to characterize it. I want you to explain what it is in the record, from your point of view or lack thereof, that means that the Constitution intervenes to prevent Massachusetts from doing it.
12-1173 +++$+++    It's all right.   What they are saying, I think the government's point is -- the other side is saying, and I don't remember the term of my property law. What's the right term? It's -- you grant to A, black acre to A and his heirs; it's a fee simple. But it's subject to a shifting; it's subject to divestiture, subject to a condition subsequent. What's the right term?   It shifts the -- it shifts it back.   It could be. There was a technical term they used to have. But anyway, that's what they're saying.   And they are saying that that's, for purposes of who owns the land, the mineral rights, it's treated as an easement. But for purposes of deciding who it reverts to, it's treated as a fee subject to a shifting use or whatever you call it. Subject to -- what did you say? Subject to --   Yes.   Well, it's different in this respect. It's different that there they were talking about who owns the mineral rights. So for those purposes they say it's treated like an easement. But for who gets the reverter, it's treated like a shift of the fee.   All right. We have a brief here from the cities, and they point out that -- that, of course, there is reliance on your side; you're -- I believe you are absolutely right. But they say there is also a lot of reliance on the other side, because cities have built highways, and they've -- or states have, and they've converted it to use under patents or under statutes that the United States gave them that right. And all those are going to be invalid if you win. So what's your response to that?   Why -- why?   Now, what about when 912 says that when the railroad abandons a piece of the right-of-way, okay, it then says that the interest of the United States, with all right, title, and interest in the state of the United States shall be vested in the town that builds the highway. But your point is, that's true, but where they previously -- where they have previous -- where they have given -- where they conveyed it to a private person, they didn't have any right, title, and interest, because on abandonment it was simply an easement. And on abandonment, that goes to the property owner who owns the -- the land on either side. Is that -- I mean, your point is that the United States didn't have any right, title, and interest on the abandonment unless the United States continued to own the property.   All right. So that is your point. They can't convey what they don't have.   Okay.   I guess it would be the private parties that would have brought it up in Great Northern, wouldn't it? And do you have any light to shed on the comparative amounts? I mean, they're saying -- for all we know there are billions of dollars worth of takings claims that will come out where the highways run, and you're arguing, of course, any reasonable property lawyer would have relied on Great Northern to think it was just conveying an easement. But -- you know, I'm not a property lawyer, and so what actually happened matters. And the amounts matter, at least to me. And do you have any light to shed?   What about on your side? What about the possibility that millions of acres has been conveyed and there are tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of abandoned railroads that property lawyers thought went to the person who bought them, and run through somebody's house? I mean, is that a figment of my imagination?   And you would say no, it isn't, and therefore I'm asking you is there any empirical support anywhere for how property lawyers have treated Great Northern, how much was conveyed, et cetera? Anything you can say on that would be helpful.
12-1182 +++$+++    Oh, '97.   Sir, I don't want you to -- finish your argument, if you had something to say on what you started out with in describing the plan. You said there are three aspects. The first aspect was you cut out anyone -- any State that's contributing less than one percent. You said the second aspect was that you used a metric of $500 per ton of NOx reduced, and you applied that to the States still in, and then you said there were three, and you never got to three, and I want to be sure you do, if you had that.
12-1184 +++$+++    I see that. But, look, what you listed in your brief on page 17, which I think was nonexclusive: Willful infringement, litigation misconduct, inequitable conduct by the patentee in securing the patent, vexatious or unjustified litigation, bad faith, the assertion of frivolous claims and defenses. And then you cite cases which say all of those in different instances have been sufficient, either alone or together. Well, why don't we just copy that? Isn't that your view?   All right. Do you want to add to that list, or to subtract?   You don't think it. Where it comes from, which maybe you don't want to say, is the Senate report on the bill, that is similar to this one enacted in 1946. Still, there are some of us who think that's a highly relevant consideration.
12-1200 +++$+++    There is a  I want you to get on a bit, because I'd say the guestion that we're, at least for me, is one of congressional intent, not in necessarily your case but in future cases. And the argument that is that the statute can be read, it silences, to say if Congress wanted to allow people in noncore cases to submit reports and recommendations, they surely would have wanted it in what they thought was a core case that turned out to be noncore. So I want your response to that, and I would couple that with my own research for an opinion when I was one the First Circuit about the fraudulent conveyances, and they are about bankruptcy. I grant you that there is a Statute of Elizabeth, it's a legal matter for several hundred years, but the person who is defrauded, the people defrauded are the creditors. And in most instances, the fraud consists of transferring property to a friend, rather than a creditor, where you know you are insolvent. Now, that is a legal matter. But it is about bankruptcy. And it's State law, but it is about bankruptcy. And it is, according to you -- I may not agree with that, but I think we have to take it as noncore. But why wouldn't Congress have, of course, wanted reports and recommendations if they couldn't get what they really wanted, which is to have the bankruptcy judge decide it?   I know that, and I would have said they were right. But, nonetheless, I am faced with case law that says to the contrary. Okay. So my guestion is, if they couldn't get -- if they couldn't get what they wanted, which is to have the bankruptcy judge decide it, why wouldn't they at least have wanted the bankruptcy judge to write a report and recommendations and send it on to the district judge so he can review it de novo?   If I find an ambiguity in that language, then you would say I would be sensible to read it contrary to what you want.   Well, okay. That's -- I got that point. One is you say, It's totally unambiguous, you can't do anything about it. But if, in my opinion, it is -- take it as a hypothetical -- it's ambiguous enough to get what Congress wanted. Now, can you give me any argument against what I just said?   I've got it. I'd like an answer to my guestion. My guestion is I want you to assume that the language is at least somewhat ambiguous. And on that assumption, is there any reason not to adopt the government's position.   I thought there were two aspects to the Article III problem. One affects the individuals and it's an unfairness, and the other is structural, as Justice Scalia has said. But both are at issue. And so where you have only a structural issue and it's a guestion of getting the bankruptcy courts to work and nobody's hurt by it, doesn't that at least cut in favor of interpreting a statute to prevent chaos -- not chaos, that's too strong -- but to prevent -- to allow the function of the court to work better?   What are we supposed to assume here on this point? In Thomas, this Court held that what Northern Pipeline establishes is that Congress cannot vest in a non-Article III court the power to adjudicate without consent of the litigants. So that's the holding. Now, if we are going to go back into Crowell and Benson and the power of agencies and whether we want to reverse the things that were held in 1938 and so forth, I guess we should have briefing on that. Am I supposed to assume that this is a case -- I thought I assumed what we have held before in respect to constitutionality. Not whether Northern Pipeline extends to where it is with consent of the parties.   Now, you heard what I read from Thomas. I was just reading it, and it talks about without consent. So what I want to know is are we going to open up these issues again? Because I have my own views on that, but they don't necessarily -- they won't necessarily command a majority, but I think we should have briefing. (Laughter.)   My guestion is are we supposed to go into that or do we just take as assumed what Thomas said and Stern said, and I think -- you know what I said. I don't want to repeat myself.   I think we should have briefing on the point if we are going into it.
12-123 +++$+++        I'm just trying to get to what you're arguing about.     And I might be off base by now.     I feel like handlers, purchasers, raisins, like an old Abbott and Costello movie.     I just want to see if Page 20 I'm right.     Tell me.     Just say you're wrong and I don't go into it further. There -- there are some people, they've been -- they are either -- they have some raisins, all right. And these particular people, whom the Department has said have acquired the raisins, it said they acquired the raisins.     And so they're there with some raisins, and then the government says, do this thing with your raisins.     And they don't want to do it, so they don't. They don't do it even though the law says do it. And then they say the law is unconstitutional and, moreover, you fined us a huge amount of money and we don't want to pay it because the law is unconstitutional, and we consider that money that we paid.     Call it a fine, call it what you want.     We consider we shouldn't have paid it and now we want it back and we want compensation and we think it's a taking and where do we go.     Can't we make that argument in the Ninth Circuit?     It's something like that; isn't that what we're arguing about?       But not quite. (Laughter.)       Yes?       Okay, okay.     So we shouldn't have to pay because this is all unconstitutional.     And -- and now what's your argument?       And then the Ninth Circuit says go to the Court of Claims.     And you say no, we don't have to go to the Court of Claims.       All I was trying to do was to get you on the basic argument, which you started with, which is why is there -- why was the Ninth Circuit wrong when they said they had no jurisdiction to hear this, that rather, they had to go -- you had to go to the --       Yes.
12-126 +++$+++        What do you think about the words "discovered in exercise of due diligence"?     You know, you could manipulate those words so as to deal with the circumstance of the -- say, below-average IQ person who doesn't have a lawyer, who isn't certain about what to do, and what counts as diligence and discovery in that case. Is that -- are you objecting to that?     Do you object to that?     What do you think?
12-1281 +++$+++    So what do you say about the Twentieth Amendment, which says that that January 3rd was a meeting? Are you saying they violated the Twentieth Amendment? January 3rd. This says the Congress of the United States shall meet on January 3rd every year, unless they appoint a different day.   And they haven't. And, therefore, they met in pro forma session. Or do you think it wasn't a meeting? And what do you think about the other part of the Constitution, which says they can't adjourn for more than 3 days without the approval of the House, which they didn't have. So are you saying that the Senate violated those other two amendments of -- the two parts of the Constitution, or are you saying that they have different meanings in the three parts?   Okay. So you're saying they violated, if that -- if they have pro forma sessions on January 3rd, they violate the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution. You are saying that if they had a pro forma session on January 3rd, that since their meeting -- their recess was still on and lasted more than 3 days, it was a violation of that Adjournment Clause of the Constitution. Now, that's one way to interpret it. Over a long period of time, they have apparently met pro forma on those days. Or we could try to make them mean the same thing, which would mean it was up to the Senate. They consider that a meeting, it's a meeting. What do we do?   Would you write that opinion, saying the Senate of the United States has violated two -- two provisions of the Constitution?   All right. Why not?   Would it -- would it -- I mean, that's my basic question, really. Why is this an important case? I see what you're saying on this one. That's fine for an answer. Thank you.   What my really basic question is why is this an important case, in your opinion? Now, you've said, oh, because there are thousands of recess appointments, not on the happen clause. You've listed 7600 or so, really, on the recess part, but on the happen clause, you've only been able to find 102. And moreover, we've had an example of -- where this Court, for better or for worse, said that two members of the board is not a quorum, and we got some more members, they dealt with the problem. They ratified all those opinions, they dealt with it. It didn't take them too much time. So -- and we have different political parties taking absolutely opposite sides, it seems to me, or some members thereof, depending on the political party of the President. And we have a clause that had to do with the Constitution and the problem of intra -- inter-session recesses when they were 7 months and nobody could meet. Okay. That isn't true anymore. So explain to me. I'm not saying you're wrong. I just want to hear from your mouth why this is an important case.   What, where is this the most surprising thing to me that you have said, and it's important, is not just the view of language at the time of the framing, but what the purpose of this clause was. I mean, this is a very well-briefed case, and I have looked at them. I have read them, actually. (Laughter.)   And I'll tell you, I cannot find anything, so far, and I may have missed it -- I'm asking -- I can't find anything that says the purpose of this clause has anything at all to do with political fights between Congress and the President. To the contrary, Hamilton says that the way we're going to appoint people in this country is Congress and the President have to agree. Now, that's a political problem, not a constitutional problem, that agreement. And it was just as much true of President George Bush, who made six appointments that happened previously, as it is with President Obama, who's made four. All right? So -- so where  and he says this clause is a supplement, a supplement, to the basic clause to take care of the timing problem. So, what have I missed? Where is it in the history of this clause, in its origination, that it has as a purpose to allow the President to try to overcome political disagreement?   Well, if it isn't a purpose, can you give me an example where the language, particularly that word "happen" -- I mean, your example was a good one but I don't think it applies, but that's a different matter. I can't -- the language is over here. The number of appointments on "happen" is few. If you are worried about James Tobin, Congress has passed a law that can be taken as looking at a vacancy occurring when it occurs within 30 days of the beginning of the recess, which would have taken care of Tobin. So look at the language difficulty. Look at the comparatively small practice in that area. Look at the other ways to get around the problem, and then give me another example in the Constitution where you have both language and purpose pointing one place and yet this Court because of practice has come to the opposite conclusion.   "Happen?" Of course, battles happen. That's because battles occur over time. Give me an example with the word "vacancy," where that word "vacancy" is used with the word "is," but not "occurred."   But just give me an English example where it's natural to say --   Your statutory example has to do with a battle, not a vacancy.   A financial emergency, correct. I'm sorry. I'm asking you for an example with the word "vacancy." That's what I am having trouble with.   I'm not talking about  I just say, could you find an example, and I'm gathering, from my answer, you couldn't.   And  and I couldn't either.   One reason they could have put the language in is because they were afraid, otherwise, the President would have the power, simply, when somebody died two or three years before, and they've had a big fight in Congress to save up all the controversial nominations and then put them through as recess appointments. That could be one thing they didn't want to happen. I don't know. You see, it's the same problem. Same problem.   The question of reports. There were reports, remember? Sorry, I didn't mean to -- your six minutes couldn't be up already.   Yeah, but I'm focusing on 30 days and the reason I'm doing that is this seems to me, hypothetically at least, a real matter for the political branches to resolve among themselves. Now, we have to decide this, so I thought, well, why not look and see what Congress objects to the least? And I got that 30-day thing from the Pay Act by analogy.   So I want to get your view on that.   I'm really interested in how you think the 30-day idea, if practical, plays out in terms of your concerns.
12-1315 +++$+++    Why, by the way  I mean, I guess the ones that increase the statute of limitations, do they apply, too? It doesn't say anything about them.   Can I just take exactly your words, and I fill in, instead of "tolling," "laches"? So?   Yes, yes, yes. All right. But I mean, now, what you're talking about is custom. You're not talking about language.   Because the language sounds to me like the same. And so then I'm obviously going to ask you if the court -- courthouse burns down or fraudulent concealment or -- you know, there are dozens of -- not dozens, but there are quite a few such doctrines. And why would we apply those and not apply the shortening ones, too.   That's not surprising because, to show laches, you have to show unreasonable delay plus reliance. So normally, it won't be unreasonable within a limitation period, but this is a unique statute. The uniqueness is not in the words, but in the facts. And therefore, the uniqueness is that it's rolling. And as long as you have a movie that's going to make money over 30 years, in year 33, they bring an action against something that didn't happen till year 30. So when the government comes in and says, oh, we'll just allow it as a defense -- you know, to law but not to injunction, law here has the same effect as an injunction. If you just leave it up to the legal part, they can bring whenever they want, as long as the movie is still making money. And therefore, it has exactly the same effect to let them -- they say, oh, you can't recover -- I mean, you can recover under law, you just can't have an injunction. Who in their right mind would go ahead and make this year after year, if a huge amount of money is going to be paid to this copyright owner who delayed for 30 years and didn't even seem to own it?   I understand the words. My specific question is, in the copyright area, as here --   -- once you have given them the right to apply laches to an injunction, you have given them precisely nothing because exactly the same thing will happen to them once you bring 15 legal actions, as if you gave them the injunction. And if there is a difference there, I haven't been able to think of it yet. So -- so I don't really understand the government's position in terms of the practice.   You still haven't answered my question --   -- which comes to the same thing. You're giving me legal arguments. You may be right in that. I'll look into that. But I'm saying, in practice, no one in his right mind could go and continue to produce this movie when every penny is going to have to go to the copyright owner -- not every penny that they spent, but every penny of profit. And -- and who's going to do it? Because, every three years, they face a lawsuit.
12-133 +++$+++        Why?     I mean, I could be your arbitrator.    I know exactly what I would do.    I would ask for five things, which will be admitted, and one thing that's going to be difficult for them to prove.    I don't see why an expert in antitrust would have to have this enormous report.      Do you want to concede I'm wrong? --      Yes, maybe. (Laughter.)      If you want to argue that stuff, which I -- then I guess maybe they're right. Maybe you do need experts on that.    I don't know that we want to get into this, but I just want to know if you want to concede that there is no way to win this case in arbitration unless they spend $300,000.       But suppose we answer --       -- the question -- the answer is yes, a class action waiver can be enforced.       Now, what are the circumstances here?     The record leaves us uncertain, we remand it for further consideration of what they are.       Because that isn't the issue they decided, whether it could be enforced.     They decided whether you can -- whether the whole arbitration agreement could be enforced.       Or you have to do without. I -- you just said what -- I thought that the expert talked about litigation costs, not about arbitration costs. So how is that handled?       You said you waived that point, whatever -- however it is.     You waived it.     Never raised it.     The Court of Appeals took it as if it were arbitration costs.       I believe you.
12-135 +++$+++        That -- that comes under our basic thing -- as I read this, the difference was between this and Stolt-Nielsen, you have two parties here and they both say, arbitrator, you decide whether or not this language, that says nothing about it, did encompass class or not. In Stolt-Nielsen, the claimant, who wanted arbitration, agreed that the clause said nothing about it.     So, given his concession there, the only way it could have gotten in is if the arbitrator was doing some policy thing.     Given the lack of any similar concession here, the way that the arbitrator got it in is he read this ambiguous language, looked at the situation, and said, hmm, guess it's in. Now, in the latter case, we should presume everything from the arbitrator's favor.     Former case, no, they've admitted that it wasn't in the clause. Okay.     So that -- now, what's the response to that?
12-1371 +++$+++ 
12-138 +++$+++    I don't -- I can't find -- it seems to me this has sprung, full blown, from someone's brain, but is not well embedded in any law that I could yet find. That is the -- this is not meant to be rude. I'm trying to figure out where this idea of the consent thing comes from. After all, it apparently comes from our Korean treaty and maybe one other, but I can't find it in -- I can't find -- the question in the case is, is this particular agreement, namely an agreement to go to the court first -- shall we count it as that kind of matter as to whether this is arbitrable that goes to a judge? Or rather is it that kind of procedural Howsam/Wiley type thing that goes to an arbitrator? Now, we did our best, I think, to try to explain how to distinguish the one from the other in our precedent. Now, you use different words. You use these words about "consent," which doesn't appear anywhere in this treaty, but I think you are trying to get at the same thing. And if you are not trying to get at the same thing, why? Why not? What are you trying to get at?   So if in fact there was the sate that said, Look, they don't say anything in the treaty, but it turns out, for purposes of counting time limits, filing a brief, they count Saturdays, but they don't count Sundays. All right? And the government says, quite sincerely, if we had known that they were going to do that, we never would have agreed. I am trying to get an example of something that is as purely procedural as I can imagine, something no one in his right mind would think a judge, rather than an arbitrator, should decide. But, under your rule, you're going to say the judges decide that and not the arbitrators, and that is what is bothering me about your rule.   By the way, in the treaty itself, you can have dozens of things, as was true of Howsam, we will follow the UNCTAD, whatever that is, the UN -- or AAA rules, and you look up AAA Rule No. 1872 (b), and it says just what I said. Okay? So, now, it's in the treaty itself, and why should that matter?   I have only found two, by the way. One was Korea, and I can't remember the second.   But in any case --   -- you explicitly say, these are our conditions of consent, and you raise the question to me, you don't answer it, because suppose one of those conditions had to do with blue paper, rather than white paper, suppose that they were just what I said, nobody still would think the United States was resisting arbitration on such a matter.   So, here, you are putting yourselves, I gather, that the UN rules, the AAA rules, the scholars who file our briefs, the Doctrine of Competence-Competence, whatever that might be, is, in fact, far broader than what they want. It submits virtually every question of arbitrability to the arbitrator. And the United States is taking a position quite contrary, I guess, to most of the world.   What's wrong with the House -- and I'm being a little defensive here -- but I didn't think there was the presumption you are talking about. I thought it said there's a presumption about that procedural rule, and I thought important language was the language that the Court has found the phrase, i.e., for the judge, applicable in the narrow circumstance where contracting parties would likely have expected a Court to have decided the gateway matter. Now, that, it seems to me, a little bit easier to work with than this notion of whether a state gave consent or didn't give consent or it doesn't mention it in the treaty.   Thank you.
12-1408 +++$+++ 
12-142 +++$+++        It says on page 5496, adequacy of the warning, I guess, the judge says, is not an issue before this jury.     And that was the point.
12-144 +++$+++        That's -- historically, I think, 40 States, many States have what was called a public action.     A public action is an action by any citizen primarily to vindicate the interest in seeing that the law is enforced.       Now, that's the kind of action I think that this Court has interpreted the Constitution of the United States, case in controversy, to say that it does not lie in the Federal system. And of course, if that kind of action is the very kind that does not lie, well, then to say, but they really feel it's important that the law be enforced, they really want to vindicate the process, and these are people of special interests.     They -- we found the five citizens who most strongly want to vindicate the interest in the law being enforced and the process for making the law be enforced, well, that won't distinguish it from a public action. But then you say, but also they are representing the State.     At this point, the Dellinger brief which takes the other side of it is making a strong argument, well, they aren't the State.     They are really no more than a group of five people who feel really strongly that we should vindicate this public interest and have good reason for thinking it. So you have read all these arguments that it's not really the agent and so forth.     What do you want to say about it?       As long as you are on that, then I would like to ask you this, assume you could distinguish California, suppose we accept your argument or accept Justice Scalia's version of your argument and that distinguishes California.     Now, let's look at California.     What precisely is the way in which allowing gay couples to marry would interfere with the vision of marriage, as procreation of children, that allowing sterile companies -- couples of different sexes to marry would not? I mean, there are lots of people who get married who can't have children.     To take a State that does allow adoption and say -- there, what is the justification for saying no gay marriage?     Certainly not the one you said, is it?       Am I not clear? Look, you said that the problem is marriage as an institution that furthers procreation.       And the reason there was adoption, but that doesn't apply to California.     So imagine I wall off California and I'm looking just there, where you say that doesn't apply.     Now, what happens to your argument about the institution of marriage as a tool towards procreation?     Given the fact that, in California, too, couples that aren't gay, but can't have children get married all the time.
12-1493 +++$+++    But in terms of -- in terms of this case, the straw --   The fact is that is where it comes from. I think, in every legal context, it means someone who is not the real. So who is the real? In this case, it is the person for whom the straw purchased. So we fit that within the language. We can't fit the beneficiary of a gift within the language and that's the reason for the distinction, and so why not do it that way?   But the other purpose that they said this provision has is to get gun dealers to run checks. And you can't run a check if the name isn't there.   Yes. But the other problem -- we're back to the language. The -- there -- they say your client -- you know, falls within the language and you say he doesn't. Is it -- all right. Forget it.
12-158 +++$+++       Is the chemical used here one of the chemicals that's listed in the annex to the treaty?
12-167 +++$+++        But that's the problem.     Is there a way of doing this, which I -- I don't see at the moment?     But the judge intervenes in a serious way and says, you go listen to your lawyer and this is a very harsh penalty and, boy, you are into -- okay?     A serious problem. And now to track down whether that affected substantial rights, you have to try to track down the state of mind of the defendant and would he have pled guilty anyway.     And that's sometimes quite difficult to do, very hard. But if you don't insist on doing it, and you have an absolute rule of structural error or something, then you suddenly discover these minor things.     The judge says, go to lunch, or -- or, you know, some really trivial intervention, and you are going to say that - the guilty plea, he can just void his guilty plea. So there should be a way of distinguishing the trivial from the -- from the really important in terms of how serious the intervention was, but I don't see any way to do that.     Have -- have you thought about that at all?     Do we have to go all the one way or all the other way?
12-17 +++$+++       If I only have time to read one case -      -- or possibly two, which would you like me to read?     I think that's, basically, the question. (Laughter.)      Okay.    But I assume you don't want me -      I'll look at those.    But I think the Commerce Clause, basically, has, as its objective, insofar as it's dormant, to prevent a legislature or decisionmaker within its State discriminating in favor of their own State producers.      Now, it's pretty hard for me to put this case into that mold.      If it does what the -- I had exactly the same question for both parts of your argument, that what it's their -- am I right in thinking that anyone can get any information -- anyone in any State can get any information that pertains to him or her?    Is that right or not?      Is that right or not?      Okay.    That's what I wanted to know, whether it's separate or not.      Anyone from Alaska to Hawaii can get any information that pertains to him or her.                     Second, that this has nothing to do with judicial records, there is a different statute that makes judicial records public.       Okay.     So we're, now, talking about the class of information, other than the two classes I've mentioned. And I then ended up -- and I'd like you to add something to this, if you can, that, really, this is about -- since getting information involves usually a benefit to the recipient, but, sometimes, harm to the person the information is about, that willing to run that harm and risk of harm is the interest in State good government, okay?      Now, if that's the interest, that's an interest that probably a State has the right, just as it has the right to say other people can't vote in State elections, if that's the interest, then I guess it could take reasonable measures related to that interest. All right.    Now, that is the -- the argument or the position that I would appreciate your addressing.      He -- he has a very reasonable request in my view, but the question isn't the reasonableness of his request.    The question's - you know, whether they can do it.    And the -- the way - the work -- the thing that's bothering me on the work part is this:    It seems that the work is sort of tailored to the statute. It's in this way.    I -- I have a job, and my job is to study election processes.    And I write reports, and I find amazing things about differences among States.    They're truly amazing.                     And I say -- you know, it would help me a lot if I was actually a voter in each of these States. That would help my job.    It would lend authenticity, and I could learn things that I probably couldn't learn otherwise. Now, does that add anything to the argument? I mean, I don't think so, but it sounds a little bit like you're making that kind of argument -      -- and -- and they either do have the right or they don't.    And I don't know that it helps that I -- that I say, well, I really want it for my work.
12-207 +++$+++        Can I ask you a particular specific quick question?       As I read this, this concerns people arrested for a felony, a crime of violence, attempted crime of violence, burglary, or attempted burglary.       And so we're not talking about people who are driving cars and traffic stops and all these other things?       The only thing we have to decide is whether a person, where there's probable cause to arrest a person for those four crimes, their fingerprints are all taken.       And whether they also can take DNA.     That's the issue?       Okay.     Nothing else.     Thank you.       That -- that part is surprising.     Then do you think the States are wrong?     I mean, they all say in their brief, in footnote 10, DNA identification database samples have been processed in as few as 2 days in California and -- although around 30 days has been average. So I guess the technology is there, now, to process this in 2 days, not 9 days.       In the case of -- do you have any information -- are there instances with fingerprints where returns have not come back for as long as 30 days?     Or are they all, or almost all, done in 5 minutes?
12-236 +++$+++        But now, look, still, the worst thing, the obvious question -- I mean, as a textual matter, but I don't know how you reconcile your position with the -- with the first words in 3300aa-11, which is talking about a petition starts this whole proceeding and you want to interpret that word "petition" meaning a timely petition.     You mean an untimely petition doesn't start the proceeding?     I mean, that's the technical linguistic thing, but if you get to your -- to your basic worrying you, what is worrying you is this proceeding, okay?     That's what's worrying you, I think, the shadow trial.       Now, on that, just what Justice Sotomayor said, you only get into this problem when the attorney has filed this timeliness matter with a good reason to think his petition is timely, otherwise forget it.     Okay? So you look at the complaint.     You see a complaint there.     He had a good reason for thinking it's timely.     It looks, on the face of the complaint, as if his client has a good claim, a plausible one.     Now, if the government wants to say, we want to present some evidence, let them do it.     And if they don't, the worst that happens is this person who thought she had a good Page 23 claim, and who was reasonable in her timeliness will get some attorneys' fees paid. Why is that -- why is that so terrible?     Why is that putting such a burden on the government that they have to go through hoops, I think, to try to get these words in the statute, too?       But that's in your control, the shadow trials.       You don't have to have a shadow trial if you don't want one.       So your view here it's the same.     No attorneys' fees when the client dies, or they decide to withdraw the petition when it's dismissed early on for a procedural ground, when the record is inadequate, et cetera. You think that in none of those cases Congress would have wanted attorneys' fees. Or is it --       -- do you think in some but Page 52 not others?       No, no, no, no, the family gives up.       No, but my question is what is your view?     It's the same problem.     He's listed, you heard, he listed six or seven different instances -- four or five anyway; he's found 11 cases, apparently. And so what is your view?
12-246 +++$+++        Then what's the law?     What is -- I mean, Joe Smith leaves a -- a blank in part of his tax return.     The IRS gets it.     Later, it turns out to be relevant, and the prosecutor wants to say, hey, he left this blank.     Okay? Now, Griffin doesn't apply, right.       I mean, isn't it -- you're not going to say that any -- any time you refuse to tell the government anything and, later on, it turns out to be relevant to a criminal prosecution, that that's taken as an invocation of the Fifth Amendment.     I mean, do you want to go that far?       Okay.     Then you need a line.       Then what is -- then you need a line.     So where is -- there's the tax case; then we have a case they're selling tickets to the policeman's ball, and somebody comes to the door, and the policeman says, hey, I haven't seen you around before, and he doesn't answer.     Okay?     Now, that's probably not an invocation. And then we have the clear line, which, in custody, and, now, you want to extend that line.     And so what I want to know if we -- if I follow you and extend it, what line do I draw?       So then -       Well, yes, there's no doubt he was remaining silent, but the issue is whether he was trying to raise his Fifth Amendment right. Now, suppose your rule were, whatever the situation, where either the individual expressly raises his right or, at the least, it's a fair implication from the circumstance that he was trying to assert his right, would that be a sensible rule? And, if so, how would your case stack up?       It depends on the circumstance.       Yes.     Well, but, yes.     The answer is going to be yes because we're going to hear it in one minute because, as you say, it follows a fortiori for Berghuis, you know, it's -- if you're going to have to make an explicit statement to invoke your Fifth Amendment right, when you're not in an inherently coercive setting, I mean, that's going to be the argument.       You're not in an inherently coercive setting, as you are in the Miranda situation, you're not at trial, and, outside those two situations, you have to say explicitly, I'm invoking the Fifth Amendment -       -- or tap on the Constitution or something in order to indicate -       -- that's what's at issue and that's what -       Yes.       Right.     And that's saying because, there, we have a line.     It's called the in-custody line.     Once you get outside of custody -       Well, I don't want to make the government's argument for them.     They'll make it very well.       So I think the argument will be, I think -- it is, at least in my mind, that if, after sitting there for 45 minutes -- or maybe it was an hour and 45 minutes -- without saying anything, I'm - I'm maybe taking a dissenting position, but, if -- when he answers -- doesn't answer over that long period of time, but doesn't say, I want to remain silent, if that long period of behavior is insufficient without the express statement to show that he wanted to remain silent, so, outside custodial setting, should it be insufficient to simply remain silent to show that -- you see, it's argument by analogy, I think -
12-25 +++$+++        Well, why don't you give us the line that's north? (Laughter.)       No, not north of trolling, but you understand the point.     What's your line?       In the middle of the -- in the middle of the class action, several of the clients, the only ones who brought -- who bought the cars -- which there is loads of evidence they're defective, from Dealer Smith, died, and they want to see if they can find three others, so they don't have to dismiss them from the class, they're almost certain -- and has loads of evidence there is the -- you know, the harm caused by the defendant.     They are missing a client.     They died. And so can they get it then?       Can they go to the board and say, look, Dealer Smith here -- we're in the middle of the case, we're finished with discovery.     We're just -- he just died and --       -- we want to find three others, and I'm sure there's loads of evidence here that there were a hundred thousand others, who bought this defective thing from this defendant, we want to find out the names and addresses.     Can they get it or not?       Not.
12-3 +++$+++       So what's the limitation? That is, if the argument against throwing the contractors in the way you want, I think is, well, then there is no limitation.    So a company that let's say is a publicly traded company, they have a building and they hire a gardener. And the gardener is a gardening company and it has three employees and it works one day a week cutting their lawn and it works four days a week cutting somebody else's lawn.    Is the mail fraud -- and then they fire one of the three employees, or two. And he gets annoyed and says it was because of fraud.    Now, the fraud has nothing to do with the company that they're cutting the lawn for.    It has to do with some other customers.    All right. So what -- how -- I don't think the statute intends to get that.    Does it want to make every mom and pop shop in the country, when they have one employee, suddenly subject to the whistleblower protection for any fraud, even those frauds that have nothing to do with any publicly traded company?    This is not really this case.      But I'm trying to foresee is are you arguing for no limitation or -      Yes.      Could you limit it as also ruling out frauds by companies that are not publicly traded themselves of course, but where the fraud has nothing to do with the contract?    That is, the whole activity just has nothing to do with the contract.    It's just chance that they happen to have a contract.     Can you rule out frauds where the fraud at issue -     -- has absolutely nothing to do with the contract?  It isn't written that way.      The road is when you see a statute that says "any policeman," they don't mean a policeman on Mars, nor are they likely to mean a policeman in Europe.    The "any policeman" is likely, although it says "any policeman," to mean a policeman in the United States. And similarly where they talk about this, the contractors, they don't mean frauds related to - you have to use some kind of scope for the word -- for the kinds of frauds that are included in the statute, and you have to read that into language that says nothing about it. And that's -- I don't say that that is necessarily easy to do and that's why I started with my first question.      The argument about this, the reason that we're -- that I've brought this up is - is because I think that the strongest argument in those courts of appeals that kind of held against you is that they fear that otherwise this statute would create any fraud by any gardener, any cook, anybody that had one employee in the entire United States and engaged in any alleged fraud would be covered.    But it seems to me there are many ways to skin that cat. And -- and one way that I suggested and now Mr. Schnapper said, no, that's -- that kind of thing related to the contract isn't going to work very well because it's too complicated to try to figure out.    So maybe we don't have to figure it out in this case.    I mean that's possible.    I -- I just wanted a universe of possibilities.      Then why isn't the SEC - sorry.
12-307 +++$+++        Why -- why wouldn't -- imagine -- there in Article II, it says that the President shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.     So the President has worked out -- I, personally, and for reasons in -- in my department, others think that this law is unconstitutional, but I have this obligation.     And because I have this obligation, I will not -- I will continue to execute this law.     I will continue to execute it though I disagree with it.     And I execute it until I have an authoritative determination not to. Now, how is that different from a trustee who believes that he has an obligation to a trust to do something under a certain provision that he thinks doesn't require that, but -- you know, there's a debate about it, but he says, I have the obligation here.     I'm going to follow this through. There'd be standing in the second case for any fiduciary, despite his personal beliefs, to continue.     We'd understand that and say there was standing.     Why don't we here?       And that's the part I don't understand.     For -- if, in fact, as you agree, the trustee or other fiduciary in my example would indeed have standing to act according to the law, even though he thinks that that law is unconstitutional because of his obligation such as under Section 2.     You agree he has the -- he has -- there is standing when he goes into court in the first place, which surely he could interpret Article II as saying and you follow it through as long as you can do it, which includes appeals until the matter is determined finally and authoritatively by a court.     If you could do the first, what suddenly stops you from doing the second?       No, they're -- they're not in agreement about whether to pay the money or not. They are in agreement about what arguments are correct legal arguments.     And I can't think of a case other than the sham cases which -- which this isn't, where -- where you would find no standing or other obstacle.     And I can think of one case, which you haven't mentioned, namely, Chadha, which seems about identical.       Maybe I -- as long as you have a minute, I -- what did you think of Mr. Clement's argument this way, that -- that the execution -- can I --       -- to execute the laws is in Article II, but where the President doesn't in a particular law, under those circumstances, a member of the legislature, appropriately authorized, has the constitutional power -- a power that is different than the average person being interested in seeing that the law is carried out, they can represent the power to vindicate the interest in seeing that the law is executed.     And that's a special interest, existing only when the Executive declines to do so.       Then yet --       Or if there's no interest -- I mean, I'm back where we were yesterday. It seems to me, forgetting your -- your preferable argument, it's a violation of equal protection everywhere.     Well, if it is, then all States have to have something like pacts.     And if they have to have something like pacts, then you say then they also have to allow marriage. So then are you not arguing they all have to allow marriage?     And then you say no.     All right, so with that point --
12-315 +++$+++    Where did it say "material"? I thought -- I thought -- I think, so far as I've read this, the argument is about the truth or falsity of the statement. And you're saying that the Colorado supreme court should have said it has to be false. Isn't that your argument?   Okay. Now, I've looked at -- I've looked at footnote 17 -- or footnote 6 or whatever it is on page 17, and I think that their characterization of the Colorado supreme court is right; that is, the Colorado supreme court is going to be very surprised if we tell them that they never said it has to be false. What they said here is, "In the determination of immunity, we need not and, therefore, do not decide whether the statements were true or false." Correct. Why not? Because, they say, "The trial court properly submitted the case to the jury. Accordingly, the jury was entitled to determine the elements of a defamation claim, including whether the statements were false." So, as I read that, which I think you'll hear from the other side in about -- a few minutes, the -- the Colorado supreme court says, look, the jury found that the statement was false, so we don't have to worry about that, we're worried about whether the false statement was made with reckless disregard of its truth or falsity or knowledge that it was false. Okay? That's how I read the footnote. And they say something like that on -- on page 30 and 31 of their brief. So -- so if I'm right about that, what are we supposed to do? Are we supposed to say that matters of truth or falsity are not for the jury? Are we supposed to say that the jury went beyond what any reasonable person would go -- would do here? What is it we're supposed to do?   I do. I'd like an answer -- well, you can do it in your rebuttal, but I'd like an answer to my guestion.   I accept that for the moment -- accept all that. What's bothering me, a picky little point, but the picky point is that your statement of the guestion, whether ATSA immunity may be denied without a determination that the air carrier's disclosure was materially false? No, can't be. But I read the footnote, footnote 6, last sentence, it says there was such a determination, the jury made it, and we don't have to go back over it. So what are you arguing? Are you arguing that there should be like, as there is in free speech cases -- you know, a special duty upon an appellate court to go back over such a jury finding? Are you saying the Colorado supreme court was wrong in the second part of footnote 6 when it says the jury made it? What am I supposed to do, in your opinion.   They may have waived it -- you know.
12-357 +++$+++        What about -- what about the mob goes to a grocer and says, you know, you're dead or something if you sell Cheerios, and the reason is because they have a monopoly, some other grocery who's connected has a monopoly.     And they threaten him.     Now, does that violate Hobbs Act?       What he did was -- and he's -- he's not going to sell Cheerios.       Now -- now, in fact, they're doing it to get money, and they do get money, but via the means of the other grocer.     And there is nothing in the words of this Act that says that the property has to be taken from the individual whom you coerce. It's easy to imagine situations where the coerced individual has a relationship, direct, special and so forth, with the person who has the money.     So what happens when, say, the mob coerces the person without the property so that he will do a thing such that the person with the property gives them the property?       All right.     Now just make it different.     What they do is they get the assistant bank employee and they threaten him to do such a thing such as shout at a certain time where they know that that shouting will lead them to be able to rob the bank. I mean, you know, it's easy to think up. What I can't figure out here is, is there some requirement that the person who is coerced has to be the same person as the person who gives them the property.     If the answer to that's no, then none of the Government's chamber of horribles is horrible because there's a way around it.       And you haven't found anything on this.     You'd be making it up now, is that basically it?       Is the -- is the one?       It has to be more property, more money, more money in return for less services or something than otherwise.     That's what you're saying. But I don't think that's -- I mean, right.     But the answer -- go ahead because I -- that's the qualification you're making, the MCNally qualification.
12-398 +++$+++        I know, but I don't see the answer because I gather, if I -- if I've read it correctly, that when you have an R -- the messenger RNA does not have the same base pairs.     There's a U or something instead of an A or whatever it is.       So when you actually look, if you could get a super-microscope and look at what they have with the cDNA, with their cDNA, you would discover something with an A, not a U.     Is it AU?     Is that the one?       Okay.     Okay.     So -- so you would discover something with an A there, you see, and you wouldn't discover something with a U there.     And there is no such thing in nature as the no-introns AGG, whatever, okay?     It's not there.     That's not truly isolated DNA.     But you can go look up the Amazon, wherever you want.     Hence the question.     Now, on that one, how?     How is that found in nature?     The answer is it isn't.       Can I ask a question, which I don't think will be taken from your time.       But I have to ask you this. Look, you say don't reach the cDNA issue and the reason is because of the nature of the claim.     Okay, I look at their claim.     Their claim says they want, "the isolated DNA of claim 1 wherein said DNA has the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID No. 1." Then we turn to that and the first thing it says right there is it says, "The molecule involved is" -- "Molecule type:     cDNA."     And then it has a long list and that long list is a list of the basis, okay. So molecule type, cDNA.     So they say what do you mean they aren't claiming cDNA?     That's what they say they're claiming.       Because of the word "wherein."     So I go back to the "wherein" in Prometheus and the "wherein" -- you read "wherein" as in context, and in this context you mean to say that a person who makes isolated DNA that has lots of introns in it as well as the sequence is going to be an infringer under claim 2?       Is there any support for that other than the treatise that you cited?       I mean, I looked at that and it said read the "wherein" depending on context.       And then depending on - okay.     Then you got -- you heard what I said, so I want to know is there anything else I should read?       Yes, I saw that.     I saw that.
12-399 +++$+++        Well, wait, wait, wait. Isn't your answer 1915(a) still applies?       And so 1915(a) means - that's right.       So he does have a -- a considerable right.       I mean, they'll have to go through a set and decide.     They have to give it to him unless -- unless something overcomes the preference or there is good cause to the contrary.       Well, you're thinking about this case.     I'm thinking in general.     I think the question -       So what do we do about that?
12-414 +++$+++        Can you clarify something for me about habeas corpus law?       I -- I have to imagine facts, so let's take it as a hypothetical.     The U.S. - the district attorney says, this lawyer was adequate, and really, two factors make that obvious.     The first factor is that the client said that she was innocent, and taking that into account with the other things, that could have justified, adequately, his withdrawal of the plea and not convincing her not to. Second, the sentence that the district attorney wanted to give was more than a year greater than the guidelines for manslaughter, and that could have justified it. Now, it writes -- the court then writes in its opinion only the second reason and never mentions the first.     Now, we go to habeas, and the habeas court thinks that second reason is pretty flimsy there.     Gee, she was exposing herself to murder, et cetera, it's pretty flimsy.     The first isn't so bad, but they didn't rely on it.     Okay. So now, what is the habeas court supposed to do?     Is -- should the -- should the defendant have gone back to the State court first?     Is the habeas court supposed to have its own independent hearing and make up its own mind? How does this work?       I'm glad.     I would love to have an answer.       Well, are there rules in this area?     I didn't think -- are there rules?     I mean, doesn't every judge, whenever that judge is deciding a factual matter or the jury, take into account from every witness, whether that witness is making a pretty self-serving statement?     I mean, that's a factor. And I guess we could have some situations, sometime, in some place, where a witness got on the stand and said something that was totally in his favor, but when you heard it, hmm, and you knew the case, hmm, he's right.     And then that could happen with this kind of witness, too.     It could happen.     I'm not saying it very often does, but it could. So why should we have any special rule for these witnesses and not for any other?
12-416 +++$+++        Well, that just seems -- that's rather thin, I think.     I don't know how -- I don't have the ability to assess that and the significance of it, empirically.     The thing I wonder, therefore, you said this is common in antitrust? I'm -- I'm not up to everything in the field, but I know there's an existence of something called a per se rule, let's price fix it. I know there's a rule of reason, and I know there's a sort of vague area that sometimes in some cases that Justice Souter mentioned in California Dental, there is something slightly in between, which as I saw those cases, they're very much like price fixing or -- or agreements not to enter. And what they seem to say is, Judge, pay attention to the department when it says that these are very often can be anticompetitive, and ask the defendant why he's doing it. I mean, is that what you want us to say?     It didn't seem as if in your briefs as if you were.     Either you were asking us to produce some kind of structure - I don't mean to be pejorative, but it's rigid -- a whole set of complex per se burden of proof rules that I have never seen in other antitrust cases, I -- my question is, when I say I've never seen anything like this before in terms of procedure, I want you to refer me to a case that will show, oh, no, I'm out of date.       And are there others?       Is there any other?     Are you familiar with any other?     Because I want to be sure I read all of them.       Well, if there are few or none, then I would say, why isn't the government satisfied with an opinion of this Court that says, yes, there can be serious anticompetitive effects.     Yes, sometimes there are business justifications, so Judge, keep that in mind.     Ask him why he has this agreement, ask him what his justification is, and see if there's a less restrictive alternative. In other words, it's up to the district court, as in many complex cases, to structure their case with advice from the attorneys.       Without guidance?       The same thing is appropriate as is appropriate in any antitrust case. Are there anticompetitive effects? I have 32 briefs here that explain very clearly what you said in a sentence.     It may be that they're simply dividing the monopoly profit.     I understand that -- you know, I can take that in and so can every judge in the country.     And what's complicated about that. And then I have some very nice dark green briefs that clearly say, four instances, maybe five, where there would be offsetting justifications.     I think they can get that, too.       And they mention at least two others.     The first one they mention is because the person's already in the market thinks that the next year or two or three years is worth $100 million a year, and the person who's suing thinks it's worth 30 million a year.     And so he says, hey, I have a great idea, I'll give him the 30 million and keep the 70.     And -- and that, I don't see why that's anticompetitive if that's what's going on. And the second instance they bring up is that it's very hard to break into a market.     So for the new generic to come in, he's thinking, giving me two years isn't worth much because I'll spend a lot of money, it's very hard for me to do it.     But the defendant -- the defendant who wants this patent kept intact says, I will not only let -- I'll let you in a year earlier and I'll give you enough money so that you can start up a distribution system.     The second seems procompetitive, the first, neutral. The problem of deciding whether other matters are or are not really payments for something else, a true nightmare when you start talking about five drugs and different distribution systems and the matter of whether you're paying for litigation costs, a matter of great debate for the judge.     Okay, that's the arguments that they make.     Go ahead.       No.     No.     I mean, Professor Areeda, who is at least in my mind a minor deity in the matter, in this area, if not major, he explains it.     He says don't try for more precision than you can get. The quality of proof required should vary with the circumstances. Do you know how long it took -- I mean, and I -- of course, I -- I know a little bit of antitrust. But I mean, I think -- do you know how long it takes to take in your basic argument that these sometimes can be a division of profit, monopoly profit?     It takes probably 3 minutes or less.     And judges can do that. So you say to the judge, Judge, this is what's relevant here.     And there's a rule of evidence, don't waste the jury's time. So -- so you shape the case as -- and this is what goes -- used to go on for 40 years.     You shape the case in light of the considerations that are actually relevant, useful, and provable in respect to that case.     And district judges, that's their job. So -- so what -- I'm not saying you lose the case. They didn't side with the Eleventh Circuit.     They said there's no violation, okay? I've got your point on that.     But -- but I'm worried about creating some kind of administrative monster.
12-417 +++$+++       I have an underlying question just for my understanding of this.    Now, the unions are on your side and -- I think.    And I wondered why.    This is my thought, which suggests that I may not understand this perfectly.    It seemed like, to me, a brilliant statute, because if in fact the unions, those they represent, the workers, don't want -- want to be paid for donning and doffing, all they have to do is not put something in the collective bargaining agreement. But -- and if they do put something in the collective bargaining agreement, they can exert their bargaining power to get something else which they must want more.    So what you with your narrow definition do is you prevent the workers from doing that.    So I don't know why the ordinary worker would be on your side of it. Now, I say that because I want you to explain what I'm missing.      Right.      I see, that's where the problem lies.      Is there a way around that that doesn't involve this case, the Secretary of Labor? Or I guess you can amend the statute.    That's tough.    I mean -
12-418 +++$+++ 
12-43 +++$+++        Well, I'd really like to hear -- I'd really like to hear what you are going to say.       I wanted -- I just wanted to hear what you were going to say in answer to the second part of Justice Sotomayor's earlier question. And, to remind you of that, you were going to explain to us, which I felt I needed, the second term -- that second term.     And that just says, "FV," for value.       But I did notice, that if you make .23 times fair value, not quite by coincidence, happens to be what the companies would have made over a period of 2 years in profit, had it been the truth that the value of such companies was, as valued by the market, 9 times their earnings because a company that's valued 9 times its earnings earns about 11 point something percent per year -- taking aside all other factors -- and 2 years' worth is that. And I don't know if I've got that part right, but, if I do have that part right, then what this tax does is it takes the profits the firms actually -- actually made over 2 years -- not quite actually.     It assumes twice the -- the value of the first year. You see, so whatever they made the first year -- and, if it's only 6 months, it's twice 6 months -- you know -- that first part figures out what they really made over the first year and then multiplies it by two.     And you take that, and you subtract from that the amount that they would have made over 2 years. Now -- so it looked, to me, pretty -- this helps you, of course, but -- but it also is calculated on an average, the average of the first year's profit, they consider that the average; and, therefore, they are right in saying -- you know, a firm that was only in business for 6 months will be taxed -- the whole 2-year extra will be taken away, even when there was no 2-year extra, you see?     So that firm would have paid more than their gross income. Of course, there is no such firm, and that's their problem, but we come to that later.     But I want your view, if you can -- if I've explained it clearly enough, so you get where I'm coming from, and -- and -- if -- if I have explained that clearly enough, I'd really appreciate what you think about it.       It will do that for firms that are in business for 4 years.       Absolutely.     It won't do that for a firm that was in business 6 months.     And -- and --       A very different number.       Indeed, a number that could exceed the money -- all the money they really make in the next 2 years.       I could.       Yes, that's correct. That's not true.     There is only one company like that; absolutely right.       And -- but -- but some, particularly on the other side, want to make quite a lot out of that fact.     And they want to make quite a lot out of the fact that for that single -- whatever it's called railroad something --       I know -- I know they didn't.     It didn't happen in this instance.       Okay.     Okay.
12-462 +++$+++    That's right. All right. But, now, the question I have, which is, I think, for anyone who wants to answer it, particularly the government, I absolutely agree with you that -- that a free market in price is at the heart of the Deregulation Act. Given. I also think frequent flyer programs are simply price discounts. Given. I also think that, if you don't have contracts, you can't have free markets. Given. But I also think that the State cannot, under the guise of contract law, regulate the prices of airlines. If you allow that, you're going to have worse than we ever had. It'll be 50 different systems, all right? So, if I think those four things, what standard do I use to separate when a State is and when it is not using its contract law to regulate prices?   Well, good. Then you'll give me the answer because what I'm missing is what the standard is. (Laughter.)
12-464 +++$+++ 
12-484 +++$+++        Is -- is this a violation of Title VII?     I don't know the answer.     Smith works for Jones.     Jones' whole job is to supervise Smith and be certain that Smith, a well-known racist, has kept his racism under control.     He didn't. Smith -- they fired someone -- Smith did -- did some terrible thing and got rid of somebody for racist reasons.     He tells his boss.     His boss knows it.     His boss does nothing about it.     All right? Is the boss violating Section VII?     He -- he had no reason for doing nothing about it.     He, himself, wasn't a racist.     It was just his job.     But he didn't. Is he -- is he violating Section VII?       The immediate supervisor does -       All right.     Now -       Yes, yes, yes.     Okay.     So, there, what we have is somebody is guilty under Section VII, even though that individual did not, himself, discriminate on the basis of race, it was circumstances where the subordinate discriminated on the basis of race.     All right? And, yet, the -- there's no doubt that (m) applies to that.     (M) applies to that, I imagine, unless you're going to start distinguishing, within Title VII, are you going to say (m) doesn't apply to that? My question's going to be, if (m) applies to that, then why doesn't it also apply here?     Because you see, here, what you have is -- it's at one removed.     It is the individual who is retaliating -- been retaliated against.     That individual did not discriminate on the basis of race, nor did the individual in Farr read into it, but the whole thing is based on race. And if, sometimes, under Section VII, simpliciter, people are guilty, although the race motive -- the race involvement is one level down, why wouldn't you -- that, perhaps, is too complicated a question, and if -- you only have five minutes left, so I will take your answer as being, Judge, you better think this out on your own. (Laughter.)       Obviously, you are better off keeping your time.
12-515 +++$+++    The question is this Three situations -- I think it's the same question Justice Kennedy was driving at. One, France opens up a casino.   Two, California opens up a casino.   Three, an Indian tribe opens up a casino, okay?   Now, what is it that says that the State where the casino is located can sue France? What is it that says it can sue California? All -- they all object. What is it that says it can sue the Indian tribe?   Now, was that a statute or 0 common law?   Okay. California?   Okay. All those are common law. Both --  Then what do you do about Kiowa?   You know, but the question specifically then -- I think we're driving at the same thing -- is, remember, you just cited to me two cases --   -- one involving France and one involving California.   And I had assumed -- but maybe I was wrong to assume -- that when I read those cases, I will see, although a State can sue France, although Nevada can sue California, a private individual could not. Am I going to find that when I read those two cases?   Now, I think the answer to Justice Kagan is I'm not going to find it. So we're looking for authority, back to Justice Kennedy, that will support your proposition that the State could sue France, Nevada could sue California, but a private individual could not.   Now, what you're asking us to do then, if the answer is what I now think you're saying, is to say it's awfully complicated that, although a State could sue an Indian tribe for something that is outside the reservation, the State -- it's so complicated that I'd like some good authority for it, because a private person couldn't, but a State could sue, and it's only in certain places.   How about drawing the line with Kiowa?   He's adding one thing, which is, as you've just heard, that the Indian tribes are in the same Eleventh Amendment type position as the Principality of Monaco before the treaty.   They didn't participate in the convention and the Principality of Monaco was held to be immune, presumably, even from commercial activity. Let Congress change it. That's what Kiowa says. And that, I think, is their basic argument. And if it's a wash -- I mean, I hate to put it this way because it sounds like a joke, but it isn't meant to be -- in this case, if it's a wash, follow the precedent.
12-5196 +++$+++    The same thing is true of certain retirement funds.   So if, in fact, the person has $4 million in this special retirement fund account and he's behaved in the most extraordinarily dishonest way, the trustee has no power to impose a sanction on those funds, even if he'll earn a big income, he's lied nonstop, etcetera.
12-52 +++$+++        What's -- what's your point?     If it's not part of the towing law, then it's further removed. Page 6       I guess, I mean, I guess you could have thousands of claims across the country, millions of claims where there are all kinds of towing laws.     And -- you know, it says in Cambridge, Massachusetts park your car here during a snow emergency, it will be towed.     Probably every northeastern country has laws like that.     I guess there could be millions of negligence claims when the thing is towed, the guy broke a headlight.       And are all those things preempted?     I would be amazed.       So how's it supposed to work?       Well, all right, there isn't in this case, but I'm curious to know how it works because it seemed to me from what you're arguing, all the abandoned motor vehicle laws and all the snow emergency towing and everything else that I see every day would be preempted a fortiori.     So you tell me how it all works.       No, there's a lot of language in the majority pretty much along the line that Justice Scalia said.     And not sure if thats your point. I mean, Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority, and she said the reference to regulatory authority of a State, which is a different reference, I agree, should be read to preserve, not preempt traditional prerogative for the State. And Justice White said previously that you Page 22 have to start with the idea that this is -- historic police powers of the State are not going to be superseded by the Act, unless it's a clear manifest purpose of Congress. So I guess the problem is, with a lot of the other things, that you yourself are in an area that is a traditional matter of State regulation.     It is, in fact, regulated in a way that applies to everybody.     It is indirectly related to the transport itself, and that it takes place on -- about storage that took place after the event.     So you have all that working against you. Now, the Columbus case does offer some hope for the other side, I would think.     But what do you think?       Thank you.
12-536 +++$+++        How is that?       Now, all these were there at -- but for one -- were there at the time of Buckley vs. Valeo, and I guess the Court thought something could happen like the following:     Candidate Smith, we can only give him $2,600, but he has a lot of supporters.     And each of them -- 40 of them gets a brainstorm.     And each of the 40 puts on the internet a little sign that says, "Sam Smith PAC.     This money goes to people like Sam Smith.     Great people." Now, we can give each of those 40 $5,000. They aren't coordinated.     They're not established by a single person.     Each is independently run.     And we know pretty well that that total of $5,000 times 40 will go to Sam Smith. Okay?     What does that violate.       $5,000 is -       $5,000.     So we all have is my $5,000 going to the PAC, and there happened to be 400 PACs.     So 5,000 times -- 4,000.     Five times 40, five times 400, how much is that?     I'm not too good at math. (Laughter.)       No, no.     There is no earmarking.       Because earmarking requires that you write on a check or in an accompanying letter that you want the money to go to something.       It does not?       No, no.     They'll contribute to several because they'll get more than one contribution.       All we're trying to do - because it's hard to do in oral argument.     But what we're trying to do in both, I think, our cases is that we looked up all the rules and the regs -- or my law clerk did -- and -- and what she discovered -- and it may be wrong because I'll look at it again -- is there has been no significant change in the earmarking rules, in any of the rules that you're talking about, but for one change since Buckley. The one change -- the one change is the change that all contributions made by political committees established by or financed or maintained or controlled by a single person will count as one. So what you're seeing in these hypotheticals is, simply, the construction of precisely the same situation that existed in Buckley while being careful to have not one person control the 4,000 PACs, which is pretty easy to do. And if you want to say, is this a reality? Turn on your television set or internet because we found instances, without naming names, where it certainly is a reality.       Here is the actual ad - the actual ad.     I won't name the candidate.     You see a picture of the candidate.     There is a sign that says "Smith PAC."     Okay?     That's what it says.     And then it says, "Make a donation to help Smith PAC support Republican," if you like, or "Democratic candidates." Period.     And then they have an address.     All right. Now, it doesn't take a genius to figure out what they're going to do with the money and that maybe Smith will get a pretty good share of it.     Now, if Smith has 400 people who figure this out, he will have 400 times 5,000 times one person. Now, you say that really couldn't happen because of the designation.     We haven't found a designation rule that would stop it.     But then Justice Sotomayor is saying, I don't know.     And I don't either because there's been no hearing, there's been no evidence presented.     There is nothing but dismissal.       So -- so I read in one summer before BCRA -- I spent several weeks reading the record before the district court in that very lengthy case on this. And it was filled with testimony by senators and congressmen that a handful of people can give hundreds of thousands of dollars, they know who those people are and that those people do have undue influence, which means, in First Amendment terms, that the individual who, in fact, has wonderful ideas and convinces others, even by paying three cents to buy the internet or something, hasn't a shot because it will influence people, not ideas, but the money.     Now, there was a record on that. Here, there is no record showing whether this aspect does or does not have the same tendency. That is why I ask:     How can I decide this on the basis of theory when the record previously showed the contrary of what's been argued and, in fact, at least might show that even in respect to these limits?
12-547 +++$+++        Do you have any idea -- a rough estimate, how many cases there were between, say, '75 and '93, where this defense was raised?       Do you know about how many? About.       But what's in the 37 cases then?     I -- they got up there.     I assume the defendant must have brought them.     They must have brought them. They must have wanted to -- to raise the defense, and somebody said no.       Yeah.
12-562 +++$+++        How does it not? "Partnership items" is defined to include legal and factual determinations that underlie the determination, among other things, of income, credit, gain/loss. Okay.     Whether there is a partnership at all does underlie the determination of whether the partnership return, which had all kinds of numbers on it, if it shows anything.       All right.     So therefore, it's a partnership item.     Does this penalty relate to a partnership item?     I don't want to say that you are right for the wrong reasons, so you better be sure I'm right. That is, the -- the -- does it relate to a partnership item?     I just told you what a partnership item was.     It certainly seems to because zero is what it relates to.       End of case?       It can't be that simple. We have three courts here -
12-574 +++$+++ 
12-609 +++$+++        Should we say anything about that?     I mean, one of the things he testified to -- that is, the government expert testified to -- the defendant is one of those unusual people who was actually exposed to a variety of different people in his life. He had people who were criminal types. There were drug users.     He found himself identifying and looking up to people alternatively described as "bad boys" or "outlaws," looking up to them, being impressed and awed by them and, in certain circumstances, wanting to outdo them. Well, that doesn't seem to have much to do with the issue that the defendant put into the -- wanted to put in, in the Federal court, which was he wanted to ask about his -- about his -- his words exactly are "a defense of insanity," which can be interpreted broadly, namely, whether you're insane or not. So we both have the government expert saying no, he's not insane, and the government expert going on to give an explanation of why he shot the sheriff, so is that -- is that, in your opinion, something we should say that's a serious question, whether that exceeds it, et cetera?     What should we say about it?       All right.     So your words would be, because they have introduced what we'd say as, the defense has introduced an argument, that even if it's proper for the introduction of the government's expert witnesses under the Fifth Amendment, it still cannot be beyond -- go beyond what is -- what's your exact word, "reasonably" -       -- reasonably related to the defense of insanity that the defendant himself raised, and then that would be an issue for the Kansas court to decide.       Well, you'd bring up arguments why this is okay, and they would bring up arguments why it isn't reasonably related, and Kansas would decide.       I think what he's saying is that, look, in Simmons, there is a Fourth Amendment problem, and the defendant wants to testify in a Fourth Amendment hearing.     And if he does, the State will take that statement and use it at the trial. So because of the reasons -- I'd say the policies underlying the Fourth Amendment, the court says, that's wrong.     He can go testify at the suppression hearing, and then they can't use his statement later.     So by analogy, he says, it's a similar situation.     He says, it's the policy behind the Fifth Amendment that says, if you're going to go see the government under compulsion -- the psychiatrist, you shouldn't be able to introduce that later. I mean, I think that's, in my looking at them -- because I'm trying to see if I got the argument basically right, which is what I wanted to find out, and now, what's the response to that particular argument?       You'd have to say then there's difference between the Fifth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment, and that difference would be what?
12-62 +++$+++        I would have thought you would have gone back to Calder and Bull.     And Calder and Bull, which this Court refers to all the time, in these kinds of cases, has four categories, and the only one that fits this case is a law that changes the punishment --       -- and inflicts a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when committed.     So whatever these other hypotheticals are, they do not involve -- they are not laws that change the punishment, but yours is a law that changes the punishment.       I wouldn't concede that.
12-682 +++$+++        That's the benefit to a minority group.     But what I'm thinking is go read the cases.     You yourself seem to say these cases seem to apply alike to the benefits or to the discrimination against it.     I mean, there is lots of language in Seattle.       You come -- now, suppose you take that and say, all right, it was meant in context, but the context includes constitutional amendments.     Because with the constitutional amendment you are restructuring.     Now, you would lose on that theory, but there would be a limitation on the extent to which the people have the right to move powers around.
12-696 +++$+++       Do you have any objection to -- to doing one thing that was suggested in the circuit court opinion, which is to publicize rather thoroughly in -- in the area that those who were not Christians, and perhaps not even religious, are also welcome to appear and to have either a prayer or the equivalent if they're not religious?    Do you have an objection to that?      Well, then -- then there - is there a disagreement on that point, because certainly, that was one of the concerns.    It wasn't on anyone's website.    There are -- Greece is a small town very near Rochester, and there are, at least in Rochester, lots of people of different religions, including quite a few of no religion. So -- so could you work that out, do you think, if that were the only objecting point?      No, no.    I'm not saying it's a constitutional problem I got from the opinion of doing the opposite, of -- of not making an effort to make people who are not Christian feel, although they live near in or near the town or are affected thereby, participants over time.      I'm not saying it's not.    I want to know if you have any objection.    I -      Do you -- would you have - if all that were left in the case were the question of you're making a good faith effort to try to include others, would you object to doing it?      Yes.    That's different from putting it on a website.    That's different from making an organized effort to see that people get the word.      Perhaps he's asking me that question and I can answer it later. (Laughter.)
12-71 +++$+++        Could I ask a different -- can I ask -- (Laughter.)       There's probably a perfectly good answer to this, but I -- I notice that in this Federal law in 7(b), it says what the registration form shall contain.       Now, there are four subsections and only one of those refers to a particular thing, and that is, identifying information.     It shall include a statement, including citizenship, saying -- that contains an attestation the applicant meets that requirement.       And under perjury.       It says that.     Then I look Page 23 at the Arizona law and it says in Arizona, you have to include like in immigration -- you know, a passport, a birth certificate, and then you have a couple of other things that show you're a citizen, correct?       Yes, okay.     That's not my question.       I'm saying given these five or six specific things --       -- that show you're a citizen --       -- what use does Arizona make of that attestation under perjury?       I didn't say it wasn't.     I just want to know, since you have right in front of you a birth certificate or the equivalent, what use are you Page 24 making of the Federal provision that's there in the form:     I am a citizen.     What use are you making of that?       Well, I know -- I'm sure you are and then my question is how?       By?
12-729 +++$+++        What happens -- what happens if you brought suit before the exhaustion, while it was still going on, before it ended, but you said to the judge, Judge, we're in the middle of exhausting, so don't -- we don't want to hear the case until that's finished, can you do that or not?       It's an open question. So then if it were held that you could do it, you could file the lawsuit within the three years and if exhaustion had not taken place, well, just don't hear the case until the exhaustion is done.     That would solve your problem.       I mean, it wouldn't solve your problem because you waited too long.     But I mean that would solve the problem of other people in the future in your situation.       What is it that stops that? I mean, on that ground you would say these clauses are valid.     It's valid to say he has to -- you have to bring a lawsuit within three years.     Nothing wrong with that. File a protective complaint.       -- our saying that, and what about our saying to the courts as a judge-made doctrine, exhaustion has to conclude in enough time so that they have time left to file a lawsuit?       Yes.     Because isn't - isn't exhaustion a judge-made doctrine?       It would be an unfair process that doesn't leave them a reasonable amount of time to file a lawsuit.

12-7515 +++$+++       The Model Penal Code, the Brown Commission, everybody says this is a famous law school hypothetical, I thought you would never find it in reality.    They say certainly there is liability where two people strike, each strikes a mortal blow independently, and everyone seems to agree there is liability there.    And even though no blow -- neither blow is in fact a but-for condition, because in the absence of blow A he would be dead anyway from blow B. All right.    So we start with that, I thought.    And now starting with that -- you can say I don't want to start with that.    I think that all Professor Wechsler and Professor Hall and all these people famous in my day were wrong.    Okay.    That's up to you.    But if you do take that as a basic assumption, then how do you win?    I think that was the question, and there may be an answer to that.
12-761 +++$+++  
12-7822 +++$+++       That's the reason -- maybe I should put to you at the outset the problem with the case that's bothering me.    Neighbors hear a noise. Police come to the door.    Man and wife are there.    She, as in this case, has a bump on her nose, holding a baby and is crying and blood on her shirt.    The police, for whatever set of reasons, arrest the husband.    The woman says, Mr. Policeman, I would like you to come in the house.    I'd like you to look at a couple of the closets. I'm worried about what's in them.    I can't quite tell you what it is.    I don't know.    But I'd like you to look through the house. Now, is that woman never to be able to get a policeman in the house?    Never?    I mean, months go by. She owns the house, too.    And by the way, I've tried to keep out of my hypothetical any other basis for getting in.    It's not a -- she's not a danger.    The husband's gone.    She is -- no destruction of evidence.    She won't destroy it.    You see -- and so that -- she owns the house.    Can she never invite the policeman in?      On what basis?      On what basis?      No, she says, I don't know what's in the closet, Mr. Policeman.    I don't know that it has anything to do with my bloody nose.    I just would like you to take a look around. Now, see, I tried to keep out probable cause.      I've tried to eliminate any other basis.    And that's what is worrying me on the - worry stemming from, but it's her house, too.    Can't she invite people into her house, too, whom she wants, including the policeman? Now, that's the example that got me to write separately in the other case.    That's the example that keeps gnawing on my mind, and I -- and I'd like you to address it.      How could she invite them in?    The husband has said, never, I don't want a policeman to step foot in my house, and it's not just the closet.    She wants the police to take a good look around.      That's a circular question, you see, because once you say right, you assume the answer.    I mean, if the wife has -- to the extent she has the ability to ask anyone into the house, even over the husband's objection, then the conclusion is he doesn't have a privacy right or a reasonable expectation of privacy vis--vis what his wife wants.    And if you decide it the other way, he does.    And the hard problem, I mean the hard problem for me, is -- but I'll ask the other side that -- under what circumstances, when, how do we work out?    And the answer in Randolph was social expectation.    And, frankly, I don't know what the social expectation is.      That's -- that's the initial problem I started with in this case.    The policeman is standing at the door.    She owns the house. She says, come in.    Come in.    Maybe it's I'd just like to talk to you.    Maybe it's I'd like to show you a few things.    The four-year-old says the spouse hit her. That's why she's bleeding.    She later says, oh, no, it wasn't the spouse.    It was a woman named Veronica. Maybe that's all true here.    But you could surely imagine cases where you had a little window of opportunity to find out what was going on in that house, which is hers.    And now you say no, as long as the husband who may have beaten her up six times is now being held in jail lest he do it again, policemen can't go in, even when she's willing to talk to them, even when she's willing to show them a few things, we know not what. Now, perhaps, I should just sweep that - that problem aside and pay -- say it isn't controlling. But that's what's worrying me.      Well, the problem, for as long as he can't enforce it -- he's the worst criminal in the world; right from the house to 20 years in Sing-Sing.    So she can't right -- let anyone in the house, the police department, for 20 years.    That can't be right.
12-786 +++$+++    I think what he's saying, is there any good reason that they aren't liable for infringement? Is that --   All right. And I thought the reason -- you have to answer it -- is because when you have many steps in a process, and this is a very similar process of the book I'm reading now about the Seabees building constructions in World War II, you know, they put some forward warehouses and they put some other stuff in some other warehouses and they make the eventual thing by shipping this from over there and the other place. So it's tough. Now, you'll probably want to insist upon a pretty strict relationship between the different parties in a joint venture or more before you hold them liable. In other words, there's an issue I don't know about. How close was this relationship? And I ask you that because you're going to answer his question and I want to just see if my stab in the dark here is somewhere close to the -- to what you were about to say.
12-79 +++$+++        My goodness.     Are there cases where they brought such things?     I mean, every State has laws that forbid fraud.     And mortgages are probably -- and loans are probably made in the billions every year.     All it takes is someone to say, on his sheet of listing assets, to have a covered security and say, don't worry, I'll hold these, I'll hold them. Or don't worry, I will sell this one and buy that one.     Don't worry, I'll buy another one.     I won't -- I won't put up the security of my sprinkler system.     I will sell the sprinkler system and use it to buy a -- a covered exchange. I guess if those fall within the securities laws, we would have expected to see billions of actions. Why not?       I know that's what you think, but I need to know why you think it.     If there are billion -- if I'm right in my -- what I just said.       Tell me a case where the SEC has ever -- there may be such cases -- but what is done is somebody has simply tried to get a loan and he put on that sheet of paper listing assets a covered security.     And he said, I intend to keep it.     Or he said -- you know, I will buy some more, or I'll sell it and buy some more or -- you know, or put in your three things. Just list the case where they've ever prosecuted that as a securities fraud or private people have.     After all, it's beneficial, sometimes, for private people.     What are the cases?       Well, what is the case? What is the specific case, private or SEC, that comes the closest -- I grant you there is none direct -- but comes the closest to Justice Kagan's hypothetical, if you marry me, I will sell my IBM stock?       Try -       What is the SEC's closest case -- but they may be better at answering this.     What is their closest case to the horribles that they foresee if you lose?       But -- but the -- the case that he says -- I'm quite interested in your reaction to which cases that you've ever brought, this would, if you lose here, would prevent you from bringing, and Line was the one that because mentioned.       And in Line, there is a broker who says to a client, give me some money and I will buy some securities on the exchange for you.     And they gave him the money, and he didn't.     Well, that's directly related to a promise that is going to effect a purchase or sale of a security directly.     He's promising someone to buy securities for his account.       I don't think that that's this case.       He didn't say, I will buy them for you.       And I can understand how a promise to buy securities for you is a promise to a person or a statement that would lead a person to take a position.     Whether it's this plaintiff or someone in the world, it would lead someone in the world to take a position. What your opponents say is that is what is present -- not present here; neither the person who is giving the money nor anyone else, with the possible exception of the defendant, is being led by this statement to take a position in a market for, buy, against, sell, or even, if you like, not sell or buy, hold.     I'll throw that in.
12-794 +++$+++    What do we do about -- I mean, I think the relevant pages are -- it's at 526 U.S. 328 to 330, probably read those 17 times. All right. When I looked at those, I saw they reaffirm Estelle. As they quote Estelle, they say its reasoning applies with full force. Estelle says, "The court could discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of Respondent's capital trial so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned." I marked five separate statements in those two pages that came to the same thing. I looked at Estelle. Estelle has to do with the right to note -- note the comment that he wanted in respect to a sentencing fact that the jury was going to decide; namely, future dangerousness. Nothing to do with a fact about the crime, a sentencing fact. So then I said, well, what favors you here? What favors you is the last sentence of the first paragraph on 330, which says, "Whether silence bears upon the determination of a lack of remorse or upon acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward adjustment provided in 3E1.1 of U.S. Sentencing Guidelines is a separate question. It is not before us and we express no view on it." Right. It's, one, not just a sentencing fact, but a state of mind of the defendant, lack of remorse; two, it's in the sentencing guidelines; three, it is a decision for a judge, not the jury. If it isn't confined, as I just said it, then Mitchell overrules Estelle, what it explicitly denies doing. Here, we have sentencing facts, facts about his childhood. He wanted the Estelle instruction. The judge wouldn't give it. That's the argument against you, I think. And I would like to hear your specific response.   Well, I thought the facts -- what was at issue here, he has put on witnesses that show that he had a bad childhood, and he didn't himself testify about his bad childhood. And in that context, he asked for the no silence/silence instruction. The government did not object. The judge then refused to give the instruction. All right. Now, what's the difference between the facts about how his parents raised him and the fact of future dangerousness in Estelle?   I didn't see that in Mitchell. But let -- let me go back, just elaborating on that, to Justice Alito's first question. I want to see if this issue is still in the case. You looked at the instruction, and the instruction is just a broad instruction. It says no adverse inference may be drawn from anything. All right. So there seemed to be some objection you had to the breadth of that instruction, so I looked at the instruction. The instruction does say exactly what Justice Alito said and you have said. It says the -- the instruction is -- "The defendant is not compelled to testify, and the fact that he does not cannot be used as inference of guilt and should not prejudice him in any way," with a couple of, here, irrelevant modifications. All right? The instruction I just read you is not from this case. It's from the Carter case. In the Carter case, the court said that instruction must be given. It must be given at the sentencing phase. So what they did was copy the instruction out of the case, the very instruction that the court said, in Carter, the Fifth Amendment requires to be given in the sentencing phase. And that was a noncapital case. So what's the objection to the instruction, on its breadth? Not only is it the same, but the government never objected that it was too broad, and the only issues in the case were factual. They were about what happened to him in his childhood, namely, sentencing facts. And the instruction that you did read about what they should consider referred to facts and circumstances. And where, in Estelle, does it say that matters at sentencing related to facts and circumstances, you don't have to give the very instruction that Carter and Estelle required?   I see.   Does it overrule -- does it overrule Estelle?   Yes. Does Mitchell -- Estelle talks about -- you apply the same rule to facts and circumstances of the sentence, in a capital case anyway.   No, Mitchell doesn't.
12-815 +++$+++ 
12-820 +++$+++    The Convention says, in the preamble, that the parties -- that's countries -- are firmly convinced that the interests of the children are of paramount importance in matters relating to their custody. Okay? Paramount importance. So the provision you're talking about, Article 13, says, well, would returning the child lead to physical harm, psychological harm, or otherwise put the child in an intolerable position. So they mean intolerable. So I think this would be a pretty typical case. The husband says he was fine. The wife says, no, he kicked me in the stomach and did a lot of other things. The judge hearing the two sides says I can't say the husband's right.   So we don't know. Now, your idea is to send the child back to the husband unless the child gets up there and chooses between parents. That's pretty tough on 8- or 9- or 10-year-old children and -- very tough. And you're going to keep -- the -- you're going to send it back to the father in this situation, unless the mother can prove it's intolerable, either because of physical -- I mean, my goodness, a physical or psychological, you have all the doctors saying he should stay in New York. A typical problem for a family court judge, really tough. So you have the Convention, which says in the preamble, look to the interests of the child. You have every other country saying, that's what it really means; in other words, they're against you. You have the Department of State, in charge of the treaty, saying that's what it really means and otherwise against you. And so what do you have going for you? That isn't your fault that there isn't too much going for you, but nonetheless, I'd like to know what it is.   Are you -- can I ask you how it works here? I realize I don't know. A year has passed. The father never found out where the child was. Now, he suddenly finds out. He runs to Iowa. The judge looks at this Convention, and he says, well, the year's passed. You've lost, let's say, and I don't have to -- I don't have to return him forthwith. The child's not going to suffer intolerable injury. I can't use that. I don't have to return him forthwith. Now, I look, is he settled? Yes. He's settled. All right. End of the matter. But do we now, in the discretion of the father, have a custody hearing? The father can say, yes, all that's true, but I should have custody. And he goes, and under Iowa law, we see who is entitled to custody. And he has something going for him. Namely, the mother's acted pretty badly, unless she has excusing circumstances in abducting the 5 child. Does that happen or not?   No, it would go to the family court, so is that -- would that happen? Could that happen? Of course, I think.   Okay. If the answer is of course, what we're talking about here is, on the one hand, we don't want to encourage abductions. On the other hand, we don't want to treat the child as a yo-yo.   So the question is whether the custody hearing will be in a family court in Britain or whether it'll be in a family court in the United States.   That's the correct question; is that right?   So our issue about whether there's discretion or -- it's a little bit secondary because we can have a big, full-blown hearing about who should have custody, though, it will be in a different court. It's true. You lose. There is more incentive to kidnap the child. It's also true, if you win, there is a much greater likelihood that the custody hearing will be in Britain, rather than the United States, which is the yo-yo problem.   All right. Now, go -- now, say what you want to say. Now, if I understand it correctly.
12-842 +++$+++    Well, what's the reason -- I mean, I read this like Justice Scalia. I thought when you read Rule 69, obtaining discovery, you can obtain it in aid of the judgment or execution as provided in the these rules. So you look to the rule on discovery. It's certainly broad enough to encompass this. I thought, of course, you can get discovery, in an appropriate case, to find out if the judgment creditor or debtor has property in Florida. And the guestion is: Well, can you do the same thing where the executable property is in France?   And then I think that's the issue, at least as I saw it. And I don't see -- well, there are two -- three ways of doing it. One, you could just say no. Two, you could say yes, but the State Department has to tell you it won't mix everybody up. Or you could say yes, but the State Department has the right to come in and tell you it will mix everybody up. I mean, those are three possibilities, or you could say let's mix them all up. Are those -- those are the four. In other words, the Court can just do it on its own. So -- so I see four possibilities. Now, maybe I'm not analyzing it correctly, but that's where I was, starting where Justice Scalia started.   I know. But just to sort of shorten this, I understand there's a statute. The statute says nothing about discovery. The statute does permit you to execute on property within the United States anyway. And it does that under exceptions which are relevant here. For example, on the back of a bond they said, we waive all sovereign immunity. So -- so it does allow for execution in the United States. It does, in fact, say nothing about discovery in aid of execution. The rules do. Okay. So I've given you four possibilities that I could see. There may be five or six. Which do you favor? Why?   All right. Suppose I don't -- I have exactly the same guestion. Is the only reason that you cannot ask a New York court for discovery to tell us where in the world there is property upon which we can levy -- they don't want to know about property where they can't levy. They don't want to know about property they can't execute, so they're happy to write into that, even if it isn't written, which they think it is, we're only talking about property that we can seize. No other property. Now, you agree that we can go do that in respect to property in California, Florida, and New Mexico. Well, in today's world we want the same information about France, Italy, and Turkey. And by the way, we won't take one penny from those countries except in accordance with the law of those countries, not a penny. We'll get the information, we'll go over and go ask the court. Now, why not?   Well, I didn't find language in the statute that forbids it, but I'll look that up again. If the language is not an absolute barrier, why not?   All right. Let's assume we go back and we say it has to be limited to property that they have a right to obtain to under execution. So we're all agreed between the two of us we're going to do that. Now, why not?   Okay. Okay. I'm interested, though, about Turkey, France and --   Right. The word -- there are two different -- look at the rule. Rule 69 talks in (a) about execution of money judgments. And in (a) it talks about the need to conform to statute. In (b) it talks about obtaining discovery. It doesn't say a word about American statutes. It talks about the rules and statutes of the state, but it uses the word execution. So if you're saying it means execution in the United States and nowhere else, it applies to the private plaintiff just as much as -- the private defendant just as much as to the -- to the other defendant.   If we need not, then I'm back to my guestion: Why not allow it with all these gualifications? And the only answer I've heard is from Justice Alito, who says that it would be too complicated to try to figure out all the laws of France and Turkey in relation to execution. Is there anything you want to add to that before you sit down?   Clearinghouse, we're trying to get away from this issue by assuming out of the case the military things, all those lists. Then we're trying to assume out of the case anything that isn't relevant to an asset which you can attach and seize. And now we've got two sets. In the United States everybody agrees they can do it, and then there's a set abroad. We have a statute we passed, a case, Intel, which says that anybody in America can go -- you know, the Intel case, anybody can go under 1728 and go ask a trial judge to have the Los Angeles firm issue some discovery and they are going to give that to the EU. We aid their judgments all the time. So what's the principle? What is wrong where it's clear like that with a Court saying, We want to find out if they have a supermarket chain in Sicily?
12-8561 +++$+++    Well, what's the answer, though, to the problem, forgetting this case? There's a problem in child pornography cases. Congress clearly wants restitution. Makes sense to me. But if a thousand people look at it, then each one can say, but I didn't cause more than a tiny fraction at most, and so there virtually is no restitution; right? Now, every one of the thousand says that, truthfully, and so therefore the victim gets no restitution -- opposite of what Congress wanted. But their answer in the lower court was, we'll make each one of those thousand liable for the whole thing. The government's answer is aggregate cause. It's called a concept that they've sort of created, but it's there to answer the problem. What's your answer to the problem?   Yeah, it is. (Laughter.)   All right. All right. I suppose that it does. If you have the same problem, you have the same problem. Where there -- you understand. So how -- how do we answer this problem? And the difficulty of saying -- dividing -- the government doesn't find a thousand -- you know, it only finds two or three. And so you're going to be 997 who escape. And those three, what should they pay? What -- should they pay nothing? Should they pay the whole thing? Should we do it somewhere in-between? How -- just restating the problem and -- and you have experience in this field. So what do you really think?
12-872 +++$+++        But there are a few things I -- I don't really know.     I mean, does -- do you have to allege a claim under GERA for this particular individual?     I don't know. And if you do, I don't know whether GERA simply picked up whatever saving of the equal protection otherwise would have existed in the ADEA or didn't.     And I believe that GERA applies to employment discrimination claims based on gender or race or other things, right? Well, every circuit in the country has said you don't lose your -- your constitutional claim there. So are we supposed to read GERA, it goes this way in some cases and that way in other cases, when GERA is silent on the matter? And so I looked to see what the Seventh Circuit said.     Nothing.     I looked to see what you argued below.     Nothing.     I looked to see whether it's obvious that GERA does apply or doesn't apply and simply picks it up or not.     I don't know.     Maybe I'm just being thick. But nonetheless, where I don't know so much and the whole case turns on it, why are we hearing an issue that might not even be in the case?       That's about people not like the client who's at issue here.     That is about people whom the ADEA did cover.     Isn't that an advisory opinion in respect to this case?     I don't know.     That has a certain ring to it. But -- but what are we doing, deciding whether the ADEA applies and in what way to a person to whom it doesn't apply, assuming that GERA is, in fact, a separate statute that you have to sue under, the answer to which I do not know and which has never been argued.       And so, if there's so little about it, sometime, on occasion, we dismiss a case as improvidently granted, which is not a particularly desirable thing to do.     But how could we avoid doing that here?
12-873 +++$+++    Suppose you have the -- shouldn't a supplier have standing to sue the competitor of the firm to which he supplies, where the alleged liable or slander or whatever it is, is directly about what the supplier supplies? The example, make it clearer. Suppose that Bailey's sells ice cream sundaes, and the defendant has said the chocolate sauce in Bailey's ice cream sundaes is poisonous. Now, the chocolate sauce does not compete with the defendant because he's an ice cream parlor, but, nonetheless, he is directly affected by the statement that he is suing about. He is, therefore, different from the other suppliers who might have supplied Bailey's with cushions, heat, electricity. But shouldn't at least that supplier of chocolate sauce have the standing to bring a claim against the ice cream parlor that competes with Bailey?   Why not  why not in this Lanham Act suit, why shouldn't the chocolate sauce supplier have standing? He is directly victimized by -- he has not just lost sales, but the comment is about him.   Well, the answer to your guestion, if you're asking, is no, because the person who supplies labels is totally -- the statement that is sued about has nothing to do with labels. So the people who have nothing to do with the statement wouldn't have standing. But my -- do you remember my guestion?   All right. Well, why shouldn't that person who is talked about in the statement have standing? A clear distinction. Not every supplier could sue.
12-895 +++$+++       What cases should I look up for that?      That is to say, I thought generally in the criminal law a person who commits an illegal act is liable for the known consequences of that act.    That is the general rule.    I can't think -- I mean, people use all kinds of terminology, different kinds of terminology, but I thought that's the basic principle.      When you say "purposeful intent," He didn't want it, but he knew it would happen.      And moreover, he helped to produce the occasion on which it would happen.      Would you just tell me where in the brief they are, or whatever's easier.      You use the word "intent." Some people used it in order to encompass the situation -      -- of the known but undesired consequence.      It's language.    I am sure you will find language.    I want really an instance where the holding of the case is that a person who commits an unlawful action with knowledge that the other unlawful action will occur is not liable for it.      You know, blowing up the carriage and you kill the maid, who you didn't want to kill.    You are liable.      Which one is it?      LaFave.      LaFave.
12-9012 +++$+++    Can you answer this -- could you answer, it just happens, not this case, an ordinary case. Defendants -- defendant goes to Mrs. Smith: Mrs. Smith, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you. Wonderful. Let's go to the account, your account, take out $100,000 and give it to me. She does. Now, it turns out he didn't own the bridge. So he owes her $100,000. Judge: Pay her $100,000. Your Honor, I don't have the money with me. In fact, I don't have it at all. But I also gave her my valuable Babe Ruth bat. And I don't have to give her 100,000. After all, she has the bat. Okay? Now, what happens? I mean, variations on that theme come up every day of the week, I imagine. What happens?   Not under your theory. You practice in this area. I want to know what normally happens. This is a variation, I imagine, of a very common theme.   Yes, she did. The bat is on her mantel.   Perfect. And it comes under A, not B?   Wouldn't you say it comes under A, because, after all --   -- if -- if he doesn't have the 100,000, does he? So if you're going to say that means the fact that he doesn't have it, that he can't return it, and we're under B, what B says to do is pay $100,000. So you'd end up not being able to read B. It would be incoherent, I think. So it must come under A, not B. I mean, I would have thought so.   They'll read it while -- while I make these criticisms, and then they'll show me on the Government's side, I haven't read it correctly. All right. So but in any case, whatever it comes under, we subtract the value of the bat. So why don't we do here just what they do there.   And is that -- is that how the courts have run this? I mean, you know, it strikes me as so common that they're supposed to return some money.   And, in fact, they will return the money, but it has to be less the value of something that's already been given to those individuals.   I guess it would be up to the judge.   The judge is not -- there for something, and the judge would, in fact, normally, if she sold the bat, take the -- take the value at the time she sold it. And there is 90 days he can ask her to sell it. Your Honor, I don't want to sell it. I don't want to sell it. It's a Babe Ruth bat. Very well, madam. I will value it for you. We'll call in an assessor. That's at least one way I would expect it to work, and I don't understand why it doesn't work that very same way here.   No, it doesn't, you just say -- look, "in the case of an offense resulting in the loss of property." My poor victim lost $100,000. So that's this case. Return the property, i.e., return the $100,000, okay? That's simple. That's A. But -- so the judge says, defendant, return 100. Now, let's try -- take B. If return of the 100 is impossible, say because he's broke, then what are you supposed to do? Then pay the greater of the value of the property, which is 100,000 on the date of loss or pay the 100,000 on the date of sentencing. Now, wait. I'm sorry. That makes no sense. If you can't pay the 100,000, then what you have to do is pay the 100,000 or pay the 100,000. I'm sorry. That's why I say that reading it that way to me doesn't make much sense, and therefore, I think this is a case of A; it is a case where he's simply ordered return the 100,000, and there is implicit in that you don't have to return more than she -- than you took, and you already gave her the bat. I mean, the bat counts as some kind of a return. We have to value the bat. It doesn't tell us what to do. It's up to the judge.   Oh, yes, yes, yes. It's -- you have to give her 100,000. It doesn't say anything about what form it has to take. Our problem is some of it takes the form that isn't cash.   Why not? Why not just say, hey, I'll tell you what happened here. They -- we gave him a house worth 100,000, and they sold it for a dollar, and they only want to subtract a dollar, the Government. But I will tell you something. I would count that house as an in-kind payment --   -- an in-kind payment, and they were wrong to sell it. And it was worth 100,000, that was totally crooked, their selling it. And therefore, I want you to say, fine, perfectly right subtract $1 under (ii) -- (ii), but subtract 99,000 more because of the in-kind payment that was made. Would you say that?   Why?
12-929 +++$+++        I have one question here. It seems -- because I start out for reasons I won't go into thinking, well, perhaps it doesn't matter, frankly; you can get to the same result under any one of these three approaches. But then one thing Professor Sachs says does bother me, that if we take your approach, then how do we deal with the problem of removal?     I mean, you can only remove a case to a court which is in the district where the person -- the plaintiff filed.     Now, if there is a forum selection clause, the defendant seems to me to be stuck, because he can't go to a -- he can't go to a - to another. He can't go to another court.     He can't go to the court within the district because of the forum selection clause, and he can't go into another court because of 1441(a).     So that argues to me that we ought to either take the 1404 approach, or we ought to take Professor Sachs' approach, unless you have an answer to that.       You didn't really explain -- I'm sorry.     I'll read it more carefully later.     But how -- it says you have to -- you have to remove to the court or the district or division where the place of action is pending, so if it's filed in State court in Texas, you have to remove to the Texas Federal court.     Now, how do we get -- and you can't go to the Texas Federal court, according to you, because of the contract. Okay.     Now, how -- now, you explain how - how this provision over 1390(c) gets around that?       Well, you -- in other words, you can remove to the Texas court, even though it says you can remove -- you can remove to the district court despite the contract.       Despite the contract.       So what the court should say in Texas is, we have a contract which says you have to go to Virginia, but because of 1390(a) we forget about the contract and we remove it here.       That's what you're saying Texas should say.       No?       Yes.       Now, what about -- suppose the plaintiff says, Please dismiss this immediately because of 1406 or -- you know, because 1406 says you have to dismiss it; venue isn't proper here.       No, no.     The contract says you go to Virginia.       They filed it in Texas State court.     You tried to remove it to Texas Federal court.       And they say, I'm very sorry.     The contract that he loves says we can't remove it to Texas Federal court.       Well, what is the problem with this?     You admit that if he goes to Virginia - well, he files his suit in Virginia.     All right.     Then he says, judge, everything's in Texas, please remove under 1404(a) -- you know, go -- send it down to Texas. And you agree that -- that in an unusual case, you say, because you give a lot of weight to the contract, he could win and go to Texas, right?       That's your position, fine. If that's your position, what conceivable difference does it make if he goes to Texas in the first place, and then you say, remove it to Virginia?     I mean, it should work out the same way.     It should work out that the balancing under 1404 -- you know, it gives you the - the factors should be the same, shouldn't they?       It's a terrible thing.     You have to say 1404(a), and the other case he has to say 1404(a) and it -- I mean, maybe it makes some tremendous practical difference. But if it makes not much difference, I have three routes that seem to me all should work out the same way, and in favor of their route is the absolute language that Justice Kagan pointed out before, plus the footnote.     Okay? So I'm thinking, hey, this doesn't make - it's important to have a rule.     It's important to have one clear approach.     But as between the three, it shouldn't matter, and they should all reach the same conclusions.     So let's go with the language of Stewart. All right.     What about -- now, what's the answer to that?
12-930 +++$+++    Can you give me an idea of how -- just to follow up with Justice Alito. Can you -- I don't know if you asked the IRS -- the INS this question, you may, or something like it. Let's look at all of the derivative beneficiaries in the Fs, Fl, 2A, 2B, F3, F4. And for the most part, they're grandchildren, they would be, or children, sometimes, nephews and nieces. And now, think of the set of all those people who age out. Okay? They started out as children, but it's 15 years later -- what's this thing-- they're now aged out. Now, think of that set. It's -- call it a certain size. What percent of that set do you think are accounted for by the F2A people, who are the only ones on your interpretation that (3) would apply to?   Any idea -- any rough idea? Because, if you just look at it, one's natural instinct is just what Justice Alito said. This is a minuscule component of a set. It's much bigger, and therefore, it's just unlikely that Congress meant (3) to apply to a -- to a -- to a little molecule, when there's the whole ocean. Now, that -- that's the kind of argument that you're up against, I think, so I wanted to ask you that empirical question. If you can give me any idea of the empirical?   You -- did you ask -- anything that would give me -- that's the total global picture. That's the 2,000, 3,000, sometimes 10,000 aging out. All right. But -- but the real relevant thing is if we can get some idea, which seems in the paper, that your interpretation applies to -- only to a subset of those people. And just from reading it, that it's qualitative reading it, it sounds like a tiny subset of those people. Now, we can argue about whether that's for you or against you. I think it's against you, but nonetheless --   That's F2A. But we want F2B now.  right.   All right. So it looks like it's between 10 percent, and sometimes, it gets it up to 30 percent --   We don't have numbers on separation from parents. We do know that these people, the ones that would be caught on the broad interpretation, have also been waiting for years and years and years and years. They've all been waiting for years and years and years and years, and it becomes hard to choose among them.   You can find sympathetic stories all over the place, and I mean -- all right. Go ahead.   What do we do with a reasonable reading of the statute? I looked at the board's opinion here, and it seems to me, in the two paragraphs just prior to Section 5, at the end of Section 4, they have as a critical step in their -- in reaching their conclusion, their belief that the legislative record demonstrates a clear concern on the part of Congress to ameliorate the delays associating with the process of the visa processing. And they say the same thing in the paragraph just above that.   So that's what they think this statute is about. But that statute -- that problem is taken care of in (1)(b). And so the question would be, if that problem, which subtracts all the days that there was a processing delay, is taken care of on (1) (b), they can't be right, that that was the purpose of 3. So unless you can say to me how that could possibly be right, that reasoning, then what we should do, I guess, if we think that you have authority in the government to interpret this minor part of the statute, which I do, is generate. Send it back. And -- and maybe give them -- say you ought to do this again because the reason you gave is not good. Or why not?
12-9490 +++$+++    What about this the Court made quite a point of saying, "An accurate description of a subject's readily observable location is reliable in a limited -- limited sense, namely, identifying the person. Such a tip, however, does not show that the tipster has knowledge of concealed criminal activity."   All right. Not concealed here.   So that's an obvious difference. I mean, one case, it was concealed; this case, it isn't concealed. What do you say?   Didn't  didn't the tip here have something to do with his driving around in a wild way -- or at least an unusual way? I'm not sure I would have followed him, if it had been me. Anyway, you see the point.   But -- that's why I asked you, and I pressed the point a little bit, because in the beginning of your brief, it says that the anonymous tip, what did you say, indicated that a Ford F-150 pickup truck had run someone off the road.   Now, maybe you do have to be known specially whether the person's drunk or not, but you don't have to have some special knowledge of anything concealed to know if somebody has run somebody off the road.   Even if the person weren't drunk, I think it's illegal to run someone else off the road. (Laughter.)   No.
12-96 +++$+++        Now, the reason for the formula -- of course, part of the formula looks back to what happened in 1965.     And it says are you a jurisdiction that did engage in testing and had low turnout or -- or low registration?     Now, that isn't true of Alabama today.       So when Congress in fact reenacted this in 2005, it knew what it was doing was picking out Alabama.     It understood it was picking out Alabama, even though the indicia are not -- I mean, even though they're not engaging in that particular thing. But the underlying evil is the discrimination.     So the closest analogy I could think of is imagine a State has a plant disease and in 1965 you can recognize the presence of that disease, which is hard to find, by a certain kind of surface movement or plant growing up. Now, it's evolved.     So by now, when we use that same formula, all we're doing is picking out that State.     But we know one thing:     The disease is still there in the State.     Because this is a question of renewing a statute that in fact has worked.     And so the question I guess is, is it rational to pick out at least some of those States?     And to go back to Justice Sotomayor's question, as long as it's rational in at least some instances directly to pick out those States, at least one or two of them, then doesn't the statute survive a facial challenge?     That's the question.       But this is then the question, does it justify?     I mean, this isn't a question of rewriting the statute.     This is a question of renewing a statute that by and large has worked.       And if you have a statute that sunsets, you might say, I don't want it to sunset if it's worked, as long as the problem is still there to some degree.     That's the question of rationality.     Isn't that what happened?       I don't know what they're thinking exactly, but it seems to me one might reasonably think this:     It's an old disease, it's gotten a lot better, a lot better, but it's still there.     So if you had a remedy that really helped it work, but it wasn't totally over, wouldn't you keep that remedy?       Or would you not at least say that a person who wants to keep that remedy, which has worked for that old disease which is not yet dead, let's keep it going.     Is that an irrational decision?       No, I'm sorry.     The old disease is discrimination under the Fifteenth Amendment, which is abridging a person's right to vote because of color or race.       Don't change horses.     You renew what is in the past --       -- where it works, as long as the problem isn't solved.     Okay?       But there is this difference, which I think is a key difference.     You refer to the problem as the problem identified by the tool for picking out the States, which was literacy tests, et cetera.     But I suspect the problem was the denial or abridgement by a State of the right to vote on the basis of race and color.     And that test was a way of picking out places where that problem existed. Now, if my version of the problem is the problem, it certainly is not solved.     If your version of the problem, literacy tests, is the problem, well, you have a much stronger case.     So how, in your opinion, do we decide what was the problem that Congress was addressing in the Voting Rights Act?
12-98 +++$+++        Can I ask you a somewhat technical -- and I appreciate your paying attention because it's hard for me to keep all this in my mind. All right.     It's my understanding of North Carolina, everyone accepts the rule and North Carolina agrees that if you in -- in North Carolina advance to the victim $50,000 in medical expenses -- now, you're never going to get more than that back and you don't want more than that back. Now, the victim and the tortfeasor enter into a settlement and you have a rule and the rule is you will never get more than 50,000 or 33 percent, whichever is less.     That's the rule, whichever is less. So if the settlement is for $100,000, you are not going to take more than 33, so you have advanced 50.     Okay.     So you have basically three situations.     The first situation is where a judge has said -- you know what, I find that only $10,000 of this settlement is for medical expenses.     In that case you take $10,000, no more.     Is that right?       Oh.     I got the impression that if there was a judicial -- there are three situations:     One is there is a judicial finding that only 10 percent was medical.     And the second is the situation where they stipulate that only 10 percent is for medical, and the third situation is this situation, namely there is no stipulation and there is no judicial finding. So my thought, which is wrong I guess, is if the judge says it's 10 percent you won't take more than percent, but if in fact it's a stipulation of 10 percent North Carolina courts have not yet decided that, and this is a case where there is no stipulation and no judicial finding.     Now you're telling me I have that wrong.     So you explain what the North Carolina is on that because I think it makes quite a difference.       I know, but in the settlement they stipulate that 10 percent is for medical and the rest for pain and suffering.     Now, I thought North Carolina courts have not yet decided whether North Carolina -- which would like more than 10 percent -- can get it.     Is that true or not true?       They have decided?       Said?       This has nothing to do with Ahlborn.     Ahlborn, we all agree, says you cannot get more than medical -- the medical expense, okay?     The question here is how to figure that. So I thought that one way to figure it -- I will just be repeating myself.     One way to figure it is how much of this $100,000 settlement is attributable to medical expenses as a judge would say.     Now, you're telling me there is a case in North Carolina which says if the judge himself says that 10 percent of the settlement is for medical, that's not what California -- that doesn't matter according to North Carolina law, and I'd like the name of the case, the State case that says that.       Okay.     So we don't know the answer to that.     We know what you would like, but we don't know the answer.       -- can I go back for a second?     Because I want to show you where I got my perhaps mistaken idea from. There is a case called Andrews.     And there is a statement in Andrews, which is a South -- North Carolina case -- which says in certain circumstances, although the statute says just what Justice Scalia says, the lawyer sits there, he takes one-third and pays it to the State.     Then this case has this sentence in it:     "Ahlborn controls when there has been a prior determination or stipulation as to the medical expense portion of a plaintiff's settlement.     In those cases, the State may not receive reimbursement in excess of the portion so designated." Now, having read that sentence, I thought the law of North Carolina was that this statute does not apply, and that when, in fact, the jury or the judge finds that only 10 percent was for medical expenses, the State cannot take more than 10 percent.     And the same is true of a stipulation.     That's what those words seem to say to me. Now you're telling me I'm not reading those words correctly, that the case of Andrews does not affect our case here, and that you -- that the law of North Carolina is that you get one-third. Now, what is it?     Do you see why I am confused?       I see.       They say a prior determination or stipulation.     I took prior determination to mean a determination by a judge or a jury.     What does it mean, if it doesn't mean that?
12-99 +++$+++       Fine.    But what is the - suppose the employer had written a check for $100,000 to the union and everything else is the same.    Now, you ask, why did he do that?    He said because they have to have the money so that they can run the organizing campaign along the lines that everyone wants.    Is that covered or not?      So then when I write the opinion that says that is covered, but the access, the employer lists, and the -      -- yes, and the neutrality, those are not covered because.    $100,000 is, but they aren't because; and then what comes after the "because"?      No, no.    We specify how they're going to use it.    They're going to use it just the way -      Okay.    Okay.    No.    Continue with the because.    One, because money might be a go-beyond.    Okay.    What's the other?
12-992 +++$+++    Well, that's the problem. I mean, put Justice Kagan and Justice Sotomayor together. I don't see any problem that I can see in deciding whether a case is contractual or statutory because the judge has to decide. If there's a contractual part of it, if he's going to deny it, he has to decide the contractual part. So if it's both, it's both. It counts as contractual. The Eleventh Circuit rule applies. On the other hand, if we don't -- if we don't follow the Eleventh Circuit, we get into the question of, well, what about auditor's fees, what about witness fees, what about prelitigation attorneys' fees, what about some language in the contract that seems to cover attorneys' fees, but we're not certain, et cetera? And before you know it, that could even shade into the merits. And so the simple thing to do is just say what the Eleventh Circuit said. So we have one argument, that yours isn't really an administrative objection, and you have the other argument that, if we follow you, there's a big administrative problem.   All right. So all we're going to have is a contract which, in its discussion of the merits, makes some general mention of fees. And now, what we have is the initial notice of appeal has to be within 30 days of the judgment, when the fee issue is not yet resolved, and you're going to try to separate the merits from -- I mean, some -- you see what I'm worried about, what Justice Sotomayor was worried about, that these things will be very messy when you get to many contracts.   Because, now, you're saying not just attorneys' fees, also auditor's fees.   And what about witness fees? Experts?   No, no. Experts, experts, the payment of an expert.   No, no, no. It's a contract.   So expert witnesses are -- are also, so we're talking about Budinich'ing or whatever, you want to do that for the attorneys' fees, auditor's fees, expert witness fees, experts who helped the attorney, but don't testify, what's the rule of what we're putting in here and what we're not?   No, no, no. The words that make your point, I think, not absolutely obvious were when you said, "which may or may not involve other kinds of fees." Now, at that point, I'm thinking, well, if we follow your rule, there might be quite a lot of litigation going on about those words, "may or may not." If you follow the opposite rule, we've got a clear exception for statutory attorneys' fees and nothing else. All right. So -- so do you want to add anything?
13-115 +++$+++    I know that, but the reason that you -- the reason I think these guestions are being asked, my impression is exactly what Justice Scalia said in respect to a Fourth Amendment case against a police stop. But my impression also is that where you have a First Amendment case and it's not against the policeman, against Secret Service, this Court has not said that. Am I right about that? And the reason that your position, if I am right, is relevant is because I think maybe we shouldn't say that for the first time in a case where the government hasn't even argued it.   Now  and what is the answer to what I just said?   Am I right on part one, and am I right on part two?   Well, we all know you don't need to win on that guestion. The guestion is: Should, in your opinion, the Court reach that guestion. And my hesitation would be that it is one thing to talk about ordinary policemen. It is another thing to talk about First Amendment matters where we are engaged with a kind of special protective force, and certain residences there that make -- residences that may make a person hesitate to extend into that area. And so what is the government's view?   We understand that and I think that that's the problem, and I think you're being sort of picked at for this reason in my mind, and I don't know if you have an answer to this. I know everyone understands the importance of guarding the President in this country. Everyone understands the danger. You can't run a risk. At the same time, no one wants a Praetorian Guard that is above the law, and we have examples of history of what happens when you do that. So everyone is looking for some kind of line that permits the protection but denies the Praetorian Guard. And if you have anything to say that we're immersed in details about how to get to that general objective, I would love to hear it from either side.
13-132 +++$+++ 
13-193 +++$+++ 
13-298 +++$+++    Why is that less abstract?   Why is that less abstract? I mean, imagine King Tut sitting in front of the pyramid where all his gold is stored, and he has the habit of giving chits away. Good for the gold, which is given at the end of the day. And he hires a man with an abacus, and when the abacus keeping track sees that he's given away more gold than he is in storage, he says, stop. You see? Or my mother, who used to look at my checkbook, when she saw that, in fact, I had written more checks than I had in the account, she would grab it. Stop. You see? So what is it here that's less abstract that the computer says, stop?   How is that less abstract than King Tut, if we had the same thing with a grain elevator, if we had the same thing with a reservoir of water, if we had the same thing with my checkbook? You see the point.   Methodology is just as you said, stop.   So what we have different here is the computer stops rather than the abacus man stopping or my mother stopping or the guy that the grain elevator has that says stop. So just saying, what -- is that it? In other words, if you say, computer stop, you have an invention. Useful add -- but if you say, mother stop, you don't?   Of course it's a caricature. It's a caricature designed to suggest that there is an abstract idea here. It's called solvency.   And what you do is you take the idea of solvency and you say apply it. And you say apply it through the computer. Is that enough to make it not just the abstract idea? And now we're at the heart of why I used my exaggerated examples --   -- because you will tell me why --   -- this is enough.   And this is exactly the question I really would like to you to focus on for me. Why is it -- and I'm not saying this from a point of view, but it seems to me pretty clear that if what you did was take the idea of solvency -- remember King Tut, that's why I use the exaggeration -- and what you say is implemented by having the abacus man keep track and say stop, okay --   Then we implement it by having somebody with a pencil and a piece of paper and this is all that they add, you see. Say: Have a man with a pencil and a piece of paper keeping track and saying, stop, or we say, implement it in the computer, which will automatically keep track and say stop, are they all enough? Are some of them enough? What's the rule? And you realize I couldn't figure out much in Prometheus to go beyond what I thought was an obvious case, leaving it up to you and your colleagues to figure out how to go further. Am I making enough -- making clear enough what's bothering me? And I'd really like to get your answer to this.   Can you in fact -- now, this is -- look, there are 42 briefs in this case. I actually read them and I found them very, very helpful up to the point where I have to make a decision, because they're serious. I mean, you know -- now, the problem that I came away with is the one that you're beginning to discuss, that if you simply say, take an idea that's abstract and implement it on a computer, there are -- you're going to get it much faster, you're going to be able to do many, many things, and if that's good enough, there is a risk that you will take business in the United States or large segments and instead of having competition on price, service and better production methods, we'll have competition on who has the best patent lawyer. You see where I'm going on that one?   And if you go the other way and say never, then what you do is you rule out real inventions with computers.   And so in those 42 briefs, there are a number of suggestions as to how to go between Scylla and Charybdis. Now, I would like to know -- I don't know if you can step back from your representational model. That's a problem. But you're all we have now. And -- and from my point of view, I need to know what in your opinion is the best way of sailing between these two serious harms.   It was like ~ there's a Bloomberg brief out here that was on this, that said, no, you can -- you can patent computer software when it's an improvement in the computer, when it's an improvement in software, when it's an improvement in a technology that is developed out of computers like robotics, when it is an improvement in a machine or technology, but you cannot improve it where it is simply an improvement in an activity that is engaged in primarily through mental processes. But what they mean by that is business, finance, and similar arts. That's -- I mean, that's -- it wasn't quite what -- I know. That's what I want to know what you don't agree with about that, because it's a little more refined than you suggested.   But I'm asking you -- I'm asking you, what about this one that I just mentioned? You see, I went through those five steps --   -- and four of them you could patent and the fifth one you can't.
13-299 +++$+++    Not necessarily. I think her point -- now, it's been very helpful to me, the argument, but I think that it's a by and large point. You see, by and large the funds in the hands of the original setter-aside of the funds. By and large, they are used for retirement of that person and therefore, they are retirement funds. Not always, but by and large.   And in the hands of the inheriting person, by and large they are not.   And so that's why she thinks the one falls within and the other falls without the phrase "retirement funds."
13-301 +++$+++    Why is that?   I mean, you can easily imagine circumstances where there's a subpoena, an administrative subpoena issued against Mr. Smith. By the time he comes around to enforcing it, where there's very little reason to enforce it, Mr. Smith is suffering an incurable disease and the district court would say, no, it's oppressive. Right? I mean, I've never heard of this rule that you -- a district court would be forbidden to look at the circumstances in which the -- a subpoena or any other discovery document is being asked to enforce it now. I mean, where does this rule come from that the district court can't look at the circumstances now?   Very well. Once we say that, they've asked this question on the merits here. They say, why in heaven's name have they issued -- why have they asked this enforcement? There are only two possible reasons. One is to get some information in the years 2005, 2007 that would show that they owe more money than you claim they do owe, since you issued a final thing, which would be impossible because the statute of limitations has run. And the other possible reason is that you want to obtain information to put in the tax court proceeding, which, in fact, is supported by the fact that the agents who came to enforce it were tax court lawyers and not the regular lawyers. And, in fact, it would be absolutely illegal under the law -- the rules of the tax court. So they said, that's our information. That's why we think this is oppressive. And your response to that is if they're wrong, why do you want this information?   Very good. Then you will explain to me why is it -- why is it that the government wants this information? To do what?   My question was you want the information?   Wait, wait. Now, explain that one to me.   Now, when you say information, isn't the final partnership determination -- the final partnership for the years 2005, 2007, is it you want the information to revise that? Is that why you want it?   Yes. So you want the information --   I want to know yes or no. What are the reasons you want this information? One is you want to change the number on the final partnership assessment of liability. Is that one of the reasons?   Yes or no, please.   You want -- in other words, I want to be quite precise. I've asked the question, do you want the information with the idea in mind that it might show you should change the final number?   Yes. Is there any other reason you want the information?   Okay. Thank you.   Yes. But there's more that's why -- what I don't have clear in my mind is how to write the facts into this. I mean, before we had our previous colloquy, I guess they had no idea why you wanted this information more specifically than you're saying. And then you say, quite truthfully -- it only took three seconds -- and you said no, we want it because we might want to revise the -- the final partnership -- final partnership administrative adjustment. And then what perhaps they'll say next -- I'm just getting this out of their brief, they'll say -- in your own handbook you say, once that's issued, "The examination has been concluded and the Service should no longer be in the process of gathering data to support a determination." And then they have a whole paragraph full of similar things from the IRS. So they'll read them to you, not you, but the lawyer, and they'll say, well, what was special about this that you decided to have this extra examination? And there'll have to be an answer to that. Well, as a -- as a sort of lay person in this area reading that, that sounds like a good set of questions to ask. You'd be interested in what the answer is and they should be able to ask them. Now, am I missing something? Can I say -- would I cause some kind of big problem for something or it's -- if I were to say in an opinion, look, this is the kind of thing that they want to know, and it sounds as if, since we don't know your side of it, but it sounds as if this is the situation, and they should be able to find out.   Well, I mean, if you change it to that, the only reason there that she in her affidavit, the agent, just says she wants the information to help decide the tax liability. She doesn't say anything specific. So you're saying the reason we wanted it is we wanted to change the tax liability possibly. That's a matter in the Tax Court. And therefore, you wanted it for the Tax Court. So now there's a question. Can you use a subpoena enforced through a court to get information that you, I think, are saying -- correct me if I'm not right -- has no purpose other than to change, modify, or help our case in the Tax Court.   I realize that.   So if that is the only reason for enforcing the summons, I don't know, is there any more need for a hearing? I mean, it's a legal question.   You said you can get information to help their case or change the liability in the Tax Court. And they say you can't.   I don't think we can decide that, can we?
13-316 +++$+++    How does it work -- how does it work if you have Mr. Crook, Mr. Crook has a bank account at Bank of America, he has $32 in it. He writes a check for 5,000. He sees somebody on the street whom he vaguely knows and says, here, take my check; go to the bank; give me $200 or give me 1,000. Now, he's got the money from Mr. Smith. He didn't obtain money from the bank. It was Mr. Smith who did or did not go into the bank to get the money. Does that fall within the statute?   So this doesn't fall within the statute at all. In fact -- in other words, have we got some cases on that?   No, no. This is not good, but I mean, you know, what you tried -- you didn't get the money from the bank. What you did was just write a false check, knowing that in all likelihood the guy you give the check to is going to go right to the bank and get the money. Now, I just wonder is there some authority as to whether that falls within these statutes or not.   It wouldn't matter. Look, I don't think you have to -- when you say "intend," "intend" can encompass a known but undesired consequence of an intentional act. And so you may not care -- you couldn't care less when the money comes from the bank or not, but you know that the bank is likely to pay it.   So therefore, you have the requisite intent. But what I'm trying to figure out here is what's the case law on what should be a very common situation. If you give it to a third party, your fake check, insufficient funds. You just want the money from the third party. But you know the bank is likely to honor it.   All right. Try two --   Try two -- two different paths here. Path A, he believes that the bank will honor Smith's, his check, when presented by Jones. I got my names mixed up.   Mr. Crook believes that the bank will honor his check when Mr. Smith presents it. And the second is the one Justice Scalia said, is being sophisticated about these matters, Mr. Crook believes that the bank will never own -- never, never pay the check when presented by Smith. I just want to know the state of the law on those two situations.   You come back to those general statements, you do have the language of the statutes which favors you this question. But I guess the theory would simply be where Mr. Crook gives him a bad check, to Mr. Smith, he couldn't care less whether Smith presents it to the bank, and he, as far as he's fairly sophisticated, thinks probably Smith won't present it to the bank. He may to an insurance company or something and, therefore, he did not either obtain or try to obtain or believe he would obtain money from the bank.   Whether it's money that the bank itself owns or whether it's money of which the bank has custody. That would seem to me the simplest theory. And I wonder, is that what courts have said?
13-317 +++$+++    Can you -- can -- to take a totally different case, just thinking of the announcement of the opinion I had, is a contract case. We'll say it's the treaty that we're talking about. And a group of plaintiffs say: We, Your Honor, would like to show that the way that Argentina treated us was unfair under the treaty. All right. And the other side says: Well, what we think it's fair; we don't think the treaty covers this. Now, what we have here is a common issue. So we don't have to decide, to judge who's right. We've just noticed it was common issue. And so they make their case, at least prima facie, that they have a side and the other side will rebut it on the merits. Well, similarly, here, they're saying: We don't have to show that the markets incorporate every piece of information. We think they incorporate this information, and it's a general rule, they do incorporate most information. The other side wants to show they didn't incorporate this. That's fine. It's a common issue. We'll decide it at the trial. All we're trying to say is, is it a common issue, and it's not a red herring to throw in whether the markets incorporate information because normally they do, period. Now, what's wrong with what I said?   What happens if the -- if the plaintiffs say, Your Honor, I have 5,000 people here, all of whom bought the stock on the New York Stock Exchange between March 15 and April 15, and as far as people who had other kinds of reliance, we'll bring a separate case about them later. But everybody in this case bought on the New York Stock Exchange and our theory of this case is that the stock exchange did absorb the information and the price went up and then went down. Now, what -- what reason is there for purposes of certification to go beyond the efficient market? Is it good enough? I mean, why not? They all bought on the exchange. It's not an irrelevancy. Everybody would have to say it's certainly relevant to the case and they all have the issue in common.   Why go into the event study? Why?   Of course that's true. Indeed, that's the defense. The defense is, well, Your Honor, here it didn't. And the plaintiffs say, you're right; we think it did, but if he's right and it didn't, he wins. But you have to concede if they're right, you win. So why is that -- I don't understand why that is an appropriate issue. I can -- I don't understand still. Maybe it's the same. Why is that an appropriate issue at the certification stage?   I -- I see that and I understand that. But that still strikes me as a different legal issue, and your answer is, well, we decide other things at the class certification stage. Now, I might put in parentheses: Which don't belong there. So if -- why are we deciding any of -- why, in other words? I still have my question, why?   What is to prevent now a defendant from going in after the efficient market is shown, and saying, well, we have our event study; and our event study shows that this particular piece of information had no impact, and therefore they are not going to be able to prove reliance by just relying upon efficient markets; and therefore don't certify the class. Why couldn't you do that right now under Basic?   Well, is there anything -- is there any court that said, no, you can't do that; we forbid you even though it says in Basic that you're allowed to rebut?
13-339 +++$+++  
13-354 +++$+++ 
13-369 +++$+++ 
13-461 +++$+++    Yes. But that's why they don't want it.   That isn't the guestion.   But I'd still like to know the answer to the question, in your opinion. And, of course, if you want a reason, I'll give you my reason. If we take the public performance, maybe we run into what Professor Nimmer saw as a problem. Why isn't what used to be called a phonograph record store that sells phonograph records to 10,000 customers giving a public performance? It seems to fall within that definition. But if it is, there's no -- no first sale doctrine and it's a big problem. So we could avoid that problem. Now, that's why I'm very interested in the answer, not just what they want.   Well, perhaps we should remand it, because my reason for wanting to decide it is what I said. And what you've read in their briefs is they, in their supporting amici, have thrown up a series of serious problems not involving them, like the cloud, which the government tells us to ignore, and many others, which make me nervous about taking your preferred route. So that's why I was interested in this question.   Alright, assume that it isn't our problem. I'm hearing everybody having the same problem, and I will be absolutely prepared, at least for argument's sake, to assume with you that if there were ever anything that should be held to fall within the public performance, this should be. All right? I will assume that. I'm not saying it is. But then the problem is in the words that do that, because we have to write words, are we somehow catching other things that really will change life and shouldn't, such as the cloud? And you said, well, as the government says, don't worry, because that isn't a public performance. And then I read the definition and I don't see how to get out of it.   To the public? You see, separate, at the same time, or at different times? Separate or together? So a thousand people store in the cloud the same thing, as can easily happen, and call it back at varying times of the day.   How do we get out of the Nimmer example? I mean, how do we get out -- what words do I write to get out of this, throwing into this clause a music store that distributes via Federal Express, a device, or the U.S. Postal Service or even someone over the counter, distributes to 10,000 people a copy of a record which they then will take and play it? They have, to the same degree, transmitted something that will electronically make a performance of the music. So are they when they sell the record violating the display clause?   Because? Because?   Of course they are. The sounds are received beyond the place. It requires the person to take the record, put it on a machine, and then play it.   Of course there is. And that separate exclusive right has such things as first sale doctrine attached. But if they also flow here, if they -- if this covers them, which is why Nimmer wrote the paragraph that was quoted, if this covers it, there is no first sale doctrine, and that has a lot of consequences. I think so. Anyway, if you don't know and you haven't got something right there and you haven't thought about it, you're not going to think about it in two minutes, nor will I.   Once you take them out of the compulsory licensing system, they're going to have to find copyright owners, who owns James Agee's pictures? Who owns something that was written by -- like a French silent film in 1915? I mean, the problem is that they might want to have perfectly good things that people want to watch and they can't find out how to get permission. That is a problem that worries me and it worries me again once you kick them out of the other systems.
13-483 +++$+++    We might have to send it back. If we were to say, yes, they did violate the Constitution, next guestion would be is it clear? I mean, the Second Circuit thought they didn't violate the Constitution. Isn't that right?   And so they say obviously they didn't violate the Constitution, they didn't clearly violate the Constitution. So if we were to say, no, you did violate the Constitution, that footnote does not express any view.   So if they got the whole thing wrong from beginning to end, they might have to send it back, we send it back and say you got it wrong, it did violate the Constitution; now tell us if it's clear. So which should we do, decide it ourselves whether it was clear, it's a matter of Eleventh Circuit precedent or should we send it back to their tender mercy?
132, Orig. +++$+++         Then how do you -- what is -- is that absolutely necessary?            Any party State may withdraw from the compact by enacting a law repealing the compact.    That sentence seems to me your toughest point because that's what they did.               They simply withdrew.        Now, where in the contract is it something that says -- I mean, maybe that was foolish, to put that in there, but they did put it in.   And so how do you deal with that sentence, which is one that Justice Scalia brought up in his --        Well -- all right.     Well, go ahead, explain.        Is there in this implicit that the State of North Carolina, prior to their withdrawal, while they are still acting, will appropriate reasonable amounts of money for this?        Do appropriate steps include --        -- do they -- does this -- if we have a lend-lease agreement entered into a treaty and absolutely ratified, I suppose that if Congress decides not to lend and won't appropriate the money to do it, we are in breach of the treaty.        And I assume if there is a similar agreement here and North Carolina's legislature doesn't appropriate any money for whatever internal reasons, North Carolina is in breach of the treaty.        Do I understand this correctly?        Is there any authority for the proposition that when a legislature does not appropriate the money that the executive of a State has committed to another State, that State is in breach, irrespective of whose fault it is within the State?        Okay.      So this case then boils down to, am I correct, in the years prior to their withdrawal, did they take the steps, appropriate steps, that this contract obliges them to make?        And you say they did not?           But that's -- but if you win on that one, you win.           And the state of the finding of the Commission in respect to that precise point, and it's called -- what is it called?              The "Impact Commission"?     Do we have the same thing in mind, the Commission?      Is that what it's called?           They have -- they are the ones who are the judge, it says.           All right.       That's what it says.           The findings in respect to that specific 2-year point are what, and where are they in the record?          How does it work?         I mean, how does it work?    The-- there's a -- there s a plant in South Carolina, and a truck comes up filled with radioactive waste out of Georgia.          And they go to a booth, and now they are charged something.               And is the fee and special surcharge, which this refers to, the total charge?          Total charge.         And what does that amount to, primarily?            Do we have any idea on a typical --          No -- well, I don't know how they did it.    But, anyway, there s a charge.                Say it's $1,000, or maybe it's $10,000.          So -- so the truck company has to pay $10,000 to the authority.          And they are saying here that that $10,000 represents --          -- the financial commitment of all party States to the Commission.          That money might -- seems to come from a private company.          It comes from a private company.   It goes to the -- it goes to the Commission -- it goes to South Carolina --          -- and they give it to the Commission.
134 ORIG +++$+++  
137, Orig. +++$+++        To tell you the truth, I'm pretty skeptical of the fact that they're writing an appropriation right into this about regulating something they don't even know about.       Well, I didn't say it could be yes.     I would like you to tell me if the answer is yes, and then, of course, I'm going to ask you -       -- where in the record I find something that says that they knew how much each individual landowner is putting back into this river in Wyoming.     And I think you can't answer that question, can you?       Oh, they didn't?     In other words, they didn't know how much is coming back, but you're coming in and saying what they were -- what they were regulating here is they're saying, not only you get -- you maintain a right to take out 100,000 units to do your irrigation, but you have to put back 80,000, but they didn't even know what the number was, whether it was 80, 70, or 60, and the appropriation law is ambiguous?     I think -- I think I can go that far with you to say it's ambiguous, but I don't see how I can go further. I mean, that's my basic question.     It's - did you see what it was?     Was I clear?     Not too?       I'm saying, how can you read this treaty to require landowners to put back amounts into the river that they didn't even know what they were?       Yes, I think that is what -- the answer is yes, isn't it?       That's back where -- that's where I was here, too.     See, I can't get too far -- I mean, you have the word "depletion" in that definition. I -- I -- that might help you.     But I'm thinking in accordance with the doctrine of appropriation, what does that doctrine, that legal doctrine, say about use and return?     And that's why we're -- we're -- why I was thinking it seems totally unclear. It talks about seepage, the cases, which I gather is different from return.     Okay.     So could they have really meant net?     And what struck me is that they couldn't, which -- which you were beginning to address, too, is that they couldn't have meant net because the water law at that time is unlikely to have meant net for the reason that they didn't -- you don't know what's coming back. Do you see?     It's not just -- I see your point.     Your point is, well, Wyoming knew how much was going into Wyoming.     But that's not my point.     My point is what -- what's the water law?     What's the law of appropriation at that time in respect to return flows? And if people didn't measure return flows in general, I suspect in an ambiguous area they would have analogized it to seepage, which is what the -- what the Special Master thought.       Yes, they -       Uh-huh.
