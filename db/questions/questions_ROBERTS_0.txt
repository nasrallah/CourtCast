04-1034 +++$+++                 We'll hear argument first this morning in Rapanos v. United States and Carabell v. the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Mr. Hopper. ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. REED HOPPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 04-1034           How do you -- how do you define a tributary?           So what's your definition?           I know what you object to, and I know that you think your client isn't covered. But I don't know what test you would have us adopt for what constitutes a tributary.           Okay, but we still don't know what you're excluding.                I mean, the Missouri is a tributary of the Mississippi, but I assume it's still covered.                But if -- but your -- but your answer earlier to Justice Souter's earlier question was that if you dump the pollutants anywhere and they make their way to the navigable water, you're covered.         Right?            Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stoepker. ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. STOEPKER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 04-1384           Did we talk about a hydrological connection in Riverside Bayview?           Can I get back to the question earlier?        What is a hydrological connection? Is it enough if the water seeps through the ground and underground is connected with the navigable water, or does there have to be a ditch or -- or a culvert that you can see the water flowing through?           Yes?           Counsel, what -- what is the test that you would have us adopt for a significant nexus?           By that, you mean either a ditch or underground seepage?           Okay.   So there has -- there has to be any -- and any hydrological connection works.           Mr. Hopper won't like that, but for --           You may respond briefly.                Thank you, counsel.            Thank you, General. Mr. Hopper, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF M. REED HOPPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 04-1034           You may respond briefly.
04-10566 +++$+++                We'll hear argument first this morning in two cases, Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon and Bustillo v. Johnson. Mr. Gartlan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER GARTLAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 04-10566             But I thought that the argument on the other side is that those references in the secondary sources and in the document itself are meant to make clear that if the individual detainee does not want contact with his consular officials, for example, in a case where he might be seeking asylum or something like that, that it was, as you said earlier, his decision and not necessarily that there was to be a departure from the norm in international -- the international context where treaties are between the sovereigns and don't confer enforceable rights on individuals.           Right.     So the -- that's what the different countries, the signatories, are supposed to provide, and if they don't, that's a matter to be taken up bilaterally between the countries involved and not necessarily an individual enforceable right.                But do any of our treaty partners apply the exclusionary rule to violations of this?                We didn't even have it then, did we?           And that -- that's when the convention came into effect?           Well, if it doesn't --           Why don't you go ahead?           So -- so if the treaty doesn't say suppress, what authority does a Federal court have to direct a State court to exclude evidence?           Supremacy Clause gives effect to the treaty.             You just told me the treaty doesn't require suppression.                Thank you, Mr. Gartlan.                Mr. Stancil. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 05-51           Well, Miranda gives you the same, you know, right to -- to reach a counsel, a right to remain silent, and yet, if your lawyer doesn't raise a Miranda violation in trial, it can be waived.           Why should this be elevated to a special status beyond that?           Well, that's true about the right to remain silent or any other rights that are very much the rights of the defendant, not the rights of the counsel, but they're exercised in consultation with the counsel, and if they make a determination not to contact the consul, then that's a decision that counsel made, and if it's ineffective, there are remedies for that.             I'm not sure how it's different than the right to remain silent.            Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stancil, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 05-51               But it refers to his rights, to make it clear that the consular office does not have the right to contact him in the situations where he would prefer not to be contacted by his consul.           Well, 1983 is a good example.         If you have a -- a treaty between a State and the Federal Government, a Spending Clause provision, that says you've got to spend the money this way, give certain rights to the individuals, we don't always automatically hold that the individuals have enforceable rights even under 1983.            It said his rights in Gonzaga v. Doe, which dealt with the student privacy rights act, and we held -- and the -- we -- the Court held that that was -- did not give rise to individually enforceable rights.           Thank you, Mr. Stancil.
04-1067 +++$+++               We'll hear argument next in Georgia versus Randolph.              Ms. Smith. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAULA K. SMITH ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Dreeben. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN, FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER           Was --           I was curious, though, which way that fact cut.                I can see the argument that the closer the relationship, the more reasonable it is to say that the one party more or less recognizes that their privacy interests are held hostage to the views of the other.                 It's when you get the disrupted relationship, or their adverse interests, that maybe the expectations of privacy, or the reasonableness of one acting as an agent of the other, becomes a little more strained.           Thank you, Mr. Goldstein. Ms. Smith, you have a minute and a half remaining.
04-1084 +++$+++                We'll hear argument next in Gonzales versus O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS           Well, when you talk about --           -- reasons to believe and disbelieve, we don't have to make a once-and-for-all determination, do we?            A lot of your concerns talk about what's going to happen if this exception is granted.                  Now, if some of those things come true, can't this issue be revisited?          I don't regard -- maybe I'm wrong, but, under RFRA, you're not saying it's a compelling-interest test. It may be -- may not be satisfied in this case, but if it turns out there's a lot of diversion of the hallucinogen or the membership of the church expands in a way that leads you to believe it's being abused, I mean, then you'd look at it again, right?               But your -- but your approach is totally categorical.                    If you had a group that had, once a year, one drop of the hallucinogen involved here, per member, and it was rigorously policed, your position would still be the same --               -- even applying RFRA, which sets forth a compelling-interest test.           Counsel, I was a little unclear about your position on the Convention.                  I thought, at some -- one point, you said that it didn't really add much to your argument under the Controlled Substances Act, which implemented the Convention.                Is --           -- there an independent --           -- argument?              Thank you, Ms. Hollander. Mr. Kneedler, you have 4 minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS              But what -- but what does that benefit you?              I mean -- I guess this is Justice Scalia's question he asked earlier -- the Treaty is -- it seems to me if you're willing to override a duly enacted statute, the Treaty shouldn't have any greater status.               You think the Treaty gives you a more compelling governmental interest than the Controlled Substances Act?               So, we have to agree with you, though, that our Treaty partners in this area have, sort of, a zero-tolerance approach to enforcing the Treaty.
04-1131 +++$+++               We ll hear argument first today in Whitman versus Department of Transportation. Ms. Karlan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER           Even though if -- if -- do you concede that if he had, for example, refused the testing and been fired and it was a major personnel action, he would have to go through the statutory procedures before bringing that -- the constitutional claim on review of those administrative procedures?           Well, doesn t it seem odd -- and this is sort of the logic of -- in Fausto and some of the other cases -- that when you have a major action, you have to exhaust before you can go into court, but if you have something that doesn t qualify as a major adverse action, you get to go to court right away?           Ms. -- Ms. Karlan, you have a -- a statutory claim that essentially mirrors the constitutional claim.                The statute requires the testing to be random and impartial.                   If we think there s a difference between the constitutional claims and statutory claims with respect to their treatment under the CSRA, how do you handle that?                   Does he have to exhaust the statutory claim but not the constitutional one?            I still don t understand how they proceed.               Does he have to bring -- can he go right into court on the constitutional claim even if the statutory claim has to go through the grievance procedure?            So the identical claims have to proceed under two different routes.           Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Ms. Karlan, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER           Thank you.
04-1140 +++$+++                 We'll hear argument first this morning in Martin versus Franklin Capital Corporation. Mr. Heldman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL H. HELDMAN ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS             But, when Congress passed this language, the scope of Rule 11 was not as well defined and understood as it is now.                     So, the overlap argument you're making may not really go to what Congress had in mind.             When you talk about the text, though -- and I understand that the "may" language here has been read by the Court in very different ways, depending upon the statute -- but you have a statute that literally alternates sentences between "shall/may," "shall/may," and it seems to me that if your rule is closer to "shall" than "may," it seems that it was an odd choice of words for Congress to employ.                Well, but that's a general -- you're -- you seem to be arguing more generally for the British rule, rather than the American rule.            And I read our decision in Fogerty to say that when we're confronted with language like this, "may," you don't assume that Congress intended to overrule the basic American rule and apply the British one.                Those were all the, you know, private attorneys-general-type cases, where you're -- where the view is that the plaintiff is carrying out a mission of ferreting out and enforcing the law.              But that's -- this is a quite different context.            Every party who prevails on a motion to admit evidence or to exclude evidence is promoting the policies and the rules of evidence, but we don't think that those motions should result in a -- in fee shifting.            Thank you, Mr. Heldman.                Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Heldman, you have four and a half minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL H. HELDMAN ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS           Thank you, Counsel.
04-1144 +++$+++             We'll hear argument next in Ayotte versus Planned Parenthood of Northern New England.            General Ayotte. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KELLY A. AYOTTE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER           Am I right in reading your briefs that you don't object to a pre-enforcement challenge to the bypass procedure itself brought by physicians, for example?           And I gather that the debate on the evidence and the circumstances that might arise in that case would be quite similar to the debate in the present context.                  In other words, there would be the same discussion between the different physicians about what emergencies arise and in what circumstances and whether that creates a problem and whether you can get to the courts in time and so on.          It would be the same underlying sort of evidence that we have here, right?           It would be a finding that the bypass procedure is inadequate which doesn't necessarily implicate the general notification provisions.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            Of course, the -- the instructions don't tell the jury to weigh the molecules.          They tell the jury that the State has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating molecules do not outweigh the aggravating molecules.            And how likely is it, if you have a jury who thinks the -- a juror, who thinks the molecules are precisely balanced, is going to conclude that the State has carried its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the 50 here don't outweigh the 50 here?            It's a theoretical proposition --                Thank you, Ms. Woodman. General Kline, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
04-1186 +++$+++                We'll hear argument next in Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt. Mr. Frey. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER              Counsel, a -- a national bank charter typically lists the national bank's principal place of business.                       Correct?              Its main office.              But isn't that amended if the principal place of business changes? The charter is amended.              So this would put national banks in a favored position compared to corporations --              -- which are citizens of their State of incorporation and their -- their principal place of business.              My point is just --                A good bit of your argument is that your friend's interpretation on the other side would put national banks in a disfavored position.                Your argument would put them in a favored position compared to a typical corporation.              Well, but you're -- you're asking us to interpret a statute that they passed in light of events subsequent to the passage of the statute.              You're saying that when they passed it, national banks were only in one place. Well, they were only located in one place --              -- even if you adopt the reading of the Fourth Circuit.             Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan, we'll hear now from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER                Could I -- could I get your position again on exactly 1348?                    You say main office is where the bank is located?                What about if that's different from the national bank charter?                Even if its charter says something else.                Because I gather you don't have to amend your charter.                How -- how do you tell where a bank's main office is?                So its main office would be -- be where its articles of incorporation say, even if it has 90 percent of its branches in another State?             So you can have these banks -- I don't know -- presumably a State that they bear little or no relation to could offer some favorable treatment of them and they could suddenly say, you know, Wachovia's main office is in Wyoming or something, even though it doesn't -- it has one -- it has one ATM or one branch there.                  And that would be all right with you?           That would be where -- where they were located?             That would be the only place that they were located.             What --                What -- what do you mean that national banking associations are, after all, corporations?             I thought they were distinct entities from corporations.                You mean --               They're not incorporated -- they're not incorporated under the laws of any State, though.               But -- I'm sorry. Maybe this is something everybody knows but me.                        But I would have thought that a national association is distinct from a corporation in a way, for example, that a partnership is distinct from a corporation.                        And I wouldn't have assumed that the laws with respect to corporations automatically applied to national banking associations.             But you say they do?               Yes.               Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frey, you have 2 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER              No, but if there were the problems that you hypothesize here, Congress could have dealt with them by enacting something that dealt with the proliferation of branch banks rather than interpreting the 1948 statute in light of 1980's --              Well, but that's not a rule that they've adopted.                 All they say is that they're citizens of wherever they're located.
04-1203 +++$+++            We'll hear argument first in United States versus Georgia, and Goodman versus Georgia. General Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 04-1203           Are you --           -- suggesting --           Are you --           -- suggesting that the ADA does not add to the burdens of the State officials, it just simply tracks what's already required under Turner?           Under Turner, one of the considerations that can be taken into account are the budgetary limitations of State officials.               Does that apply under the ADA, as well?           Thank you, General. Mr. Bagenstos. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL R. BAGENSTOS ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 04-1236           I understand your submission -- and that's what I heard from the Solicitor General, as well -- on the difference between enforcement and the substantive right.                   You're assuring us that we don't need to worry about that, because there's no great difference between what you think is required under the ADA and what's required under the Constitution.           I'm just wondering if that's --           -- a reasonable reading of the ADA, which I had always understood to be a significant change in -- in terms of what rights are available to the disabled.             And it seems to me quite different from Turner against Safley, which talks about the demands of the prison environment and the -- and a high level of deference to prison administrators.                 Do you think that approach is, in fact, consistent with what Congress had in mind with the ADA?           Thank you, Counsel.            Thank you, Mr. Schaerr. General Clement, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 04-1203           General, when you -- earlier, you told us that this doesn't add much to the Constitution, in Turner versus Safley, and then we hear about access to the TV lounge, which doesn't sound like a constitutional deliberate-indifference Eighth Amendment claim.          I mean, if it's important to us how much of this applies, how do we address that issue?

04-1264 +++$+++                We ll hear argument next in Buckeye Check Cashing v. Cardegna. Mr. Landau. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER             You -- you concede, though, that if -- if the challenge to the underlying contract implicates the arbitration clause as well, that that is for the court and not the arbitrator.             In other words, you know, you put a gun to the person s head and say, sign this contract, and the person does.                      It contains an arbitration clause.           They don t have to go to arbitration to challenge that.           What -- what s wrong with the argument that when you re dealing with a void contract, as opposed to a voidable one, that the State policy is that you don t enforce any aspect of it?                 I mean, if you and I had, you know, a contract for murder and it had an arbitration clause, it s pretty strange to send that to an arbitrator and enforce part of that contract as opposed to saying that the contract as a whole is void.           But we don t do that with other provisions of void contracts.               I mean, if our contract had a liquidated damages clause -- if you didn t go ahead and murder somebody, you d owe me $1,000 -- we don t say, well, that part is enforceable even if the contract as a whole is not enforceable.                   We treat it as a whole.           Because the subject matter of the contract is illegal ab initio, the whole contract is -- is void and illegal.           Do we usually -- do we usually ask arbitrators to enforce broader notions of public policy as opposed to the specific agreements of the party?             In other words, if the reason the contract is void or voidable has to do with broad State public policy, do we -- what -- what s this -- the best you case you have for the notion that arbitrators enforce those types of constraints as opposed to figuring out what the parties agreed to?           Oh, no, that s not true. There may be dozens of other subsidiary issues apart from illegality.                They may say, well, once you determine that it s legal, we think that we re entitled to these damages or those damages or -- or the rate should be this or that.                Just because there s a threshold issue doesn t mean there aren t other issues that an arbitrator might decide.                Thank you, Mr. Bland. Mr. Landau, you have 4-and-a-half minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                But State law -- the supposition is that State law provides that in this case, the usury context, whatever, you do not have a contract.          That s the difference between void ab initio and voidable.            But I -- his answer would be, well, you only get to do that if you re under the Federal Arbitration Act in the first place, and if you don t have a contract, then you re not under the Federal Arbitration Act under State law.                Thank you, Mr. Landau.

BRETT BUSBY ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER           Because the other -- because the other side might make a mistake and not recognize it?           Isn't that concern present in Granberry, as well?               And yet, the Court reached the opposite result there.           One that requires the court to raise it sua sponte, even if it's not raised by the State.           One that requires the court to raise it sua sponte, even if not raised by the State, correct?            Well, it wouldn't --            -- be an abuse of --            It wouldn't be an abuse of discretion for him to suggest an amendment if he's got the opportunity to rule on the amendment later on.         And then presumably the ruling would be reviewed for abuse of discretion.           Well, then why doesn't that same standard apply to the decision of the Court to raise it sua sponte?

04-1327 +++$+++              We'll hear argument next in Holmes v. South Carolina. Mr. Blume. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BLUME ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER           Counsel, where -- where in the record is the testimony of the FBI agents that you were referring to?               Where -- where do you think it says you have to overcome the prosecution's case?               It's a -- it's a factor that's considered in weighing the admissibility and relevance of the third party guilt.                     They don't -- you don't have to prove and rebut and overcome, as you've said a couple of times, the prosecution's case.            Well, you say you don't object to the -- the Gregory standard, and the Gregory standard is the one Justice Souter just quoted, raise a reasonable inference as to his own innocence. Now, how can you tell whether it raises a reasonable inference in a vacuum without regard to the evidence on the other side?         If the evidence on the other side is -- I understand you dispute it in this case, but let's say unobjectionable DNA evidence that your client was the person there, and his third party guilt evidence is it wasn't me.          How can you tell whether that creates a reasonable inference or not without looking at what's on the other side?               No, not at all.        What you're saying is that the evidence has to be -- the admissibility of evidence has to be assessed in light of the circumstances.               If your claim of innocence is, as it may be in this case, that the DNA evidence doesn't show what you think it shows, fine, that evidence comes in.             If the evidence you're trying to get in is somebody in the jailhouse said he heard that somebody else did it, and the -- and you don't challenge the DNA evidence that places your client there, then maybe that doesn't create a reasonable inference, while it might in a different case, depending on the nature of the prosecution's evidence.           But that's the -- that's the problem.           That's why this is a special category of evidence.           It's not any evidence.       It's third party guilt evidence because that's evidence that any defendant could try to introduce in any case.                   In any case, the defendant can say somebody else did it and compile whatever kind of evidence he can get, whether it's jailhouse informants or -- or whatever, where the person who did it was often somebody who's just recently died and -- and is not there to present an alibi of his own.          In every case the defendant can come up with this evidence, and so you have a special rule that's designed to deal with that. And all, it seems to me, that the State court decision is saying, when you look at the prosecution's case, is if -- if the prosecution's case makes that an -- unreasonable under the Gregory test that you agree with, the reasonable inference, if it's unreasonable to suggest that somebody else did it, doesn't mean that you're guilty.             You may have all sorts of other claims that you can make, but you just don't get to present that type of evidence because of the susceptibility of prejudice and the susceptibility of fraud and all that kind of stuff.               You mean on -- in your case.           What do you say in -- you cited us to footnote 8 in the court's opinion, and it says that your claims do not eliminate the fact that 99.99 percent of the population, other than your client and the victim, were excluded as contributors to the DNA evidence that was found.              Do you -- is -- is the court wrong in saying that?               Thank you, Mr. Johnson. Mr. Blume, you have 2 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BLUME ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER           Does your -- your case hinge upon your challenge to the DNA evidence?                  In other words, if you don't have the suggestion that the DNA evidence was manipulated, would you agree that in that case the third party guilt evidence could be kept out?           Well, why would it be -- I mean, if it meets the standard for harmless, it suggests that it didn't make a difference, would not have been likely to make a difference with the jury, and therefore it could have been excluded in the first instance.           Well, isn't that exactly what the rule is designed to prevent?                In other words, you have no challenge to the DNA evidence, and yet you bring up some third party guilt evidence.                  And your suggestion just now is, well, the jury might think maybe there's not that much to the DNA evidence.           In other words, it gets them off on a detour, distracts their attention from the evidence that is before them.

Much of the economic literature on which you rely sort of sweeps aside the particular question today because it rejects the notion of tying as a problem in the first place.             But does the Government have a position on that?         Assuming there's monopoly power in the tying product, the Government's position is that that still presents an antitrust problem?               This is not part of a broader approach to get rid of the tying issue altogether, is it?           And -- and what is the Government's position on the latter question?

Counsel, what if the first case against the Government were dismissed because of a finding that the employee was acting beyond the scope of his authority?                 Should that really bar a subsequent action against the employee in an individual capacity?           I read your --           I read footnote 5. You said it didn't.

DABNEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    Of course, the reason that the Federal Circuit has devised this additional test or gloss on Graham is that they say obviousness is, it's deceptive in hindsight.                 In hindsight everybody says, I could have thought of that; and that you need -- if you don't have the sort of constraint that their test imposes, it's going to be too easy to say that everything was obvious.

MORAN ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER           You don't -- you don't dispute the application of the inevitable- discovery principle here, do you?           Okay.           And you don't dispute that the purpose of the knock-and-announce rule is not to allow the targets of the search to dispose of evidence, or anything of that sort.           Well, but it's a limited privacy right, of course.                 These people have a warrant, right?           So, how would you describe the privacy interest that the knock-and- announce rule is protecting?           So, it doesn't go at all to the items that are the target of the warrant.           And so, why should the remedy for the violation be to exclude those items?       The privacy that's protected isn't the cocaine, the weapons, the other items that were discovered.           No, it's to protect privacy in the possessions and papers and effects. And these are possessions, papers, and effects.                It goes right to what the police are trying to seize, and you have an independent magistrate make a determination that there's probable cause to believe it, et cetera, et cetera.             The knock-and-announce rule is an entirely -- concerned with entirely different things.         And yet, you're enforcing it by excluding the papers, effects, and possessions.           You mean, if you had a case where the reason you were arresting the guy is because he's shot through the door the last three times somebody knocked and announced, you still have to knock and announce, under Michigan law?           But he couldn't get a warrant saying that.               But you can't get a warrant that says he can do that.              Do you have -- do you have any empirical basis for your statement that many warrants are executed and they don't find anything?              Do you have any basis for your statement that, in a large number, they don't find what they're -- anything that they're looking for?            Thank you, Mr. Moran.             Mr. Moran, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER           Well --           Well, isn't the -- isn't the reason it's consonant is because, in those cases, there is a -- the connection, in terms of the purposes of the rule that was violated and the evidence that was seized?           But not the general privacy of the home, because you don't dispute that if he had waited an additional 4 seconds, he could have entered the home and executed the warrant.

KASNER ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER           But one reason you might want to adopt a narrower reading, though, is, we're dealing here with the preemption provision.              It's one thing to say that, when you're talking about the SEC's enforcement powers, you adopt a broad reading; but it's quite another thing, when you're talking about displacing State law, that you would necessarily adopt the same broad reading.                But there's a lot of -- I think our cases establish that a phrase like "in connection with" carries with it a lot of ambiguity.                       You don't know exactly how rigorous the connection has to be. I mean, a auto accident by a broker who's leaving his office -- he wouldn't be in the office if he weren't buying and selling securities.                   I mean, is that auto accident "in connection with the purchase and sales of securities"?           No.   And yet, you know, theoretically it could be.

GOSSETT ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER             Wouldn't it be the same result if Congress decided, for example, to take away one of the available methods of seeking discretionary review, just saying, "We're not going to have that available anymore"?               But that would be --               -- a pretty easy case, wouldn't it?             I mean, if you have a mechanism saying some -- an alien in this position can apply for, you know, this type of relief, this type of relief, or another, and they say, "Well, we're not going to allow this type of relief anymore.                  We're going to change those" -- was -- that's a pretty easy case, under Landgraf, isn't it?            Well, that's an --            -- that may be a reasonable inference, but I think it's a real stretch to say that it "clearly establishes."                   When you're talking about a statute, and you say something's "clear," you want to be able to point to actual words. And, on the other side, the Government points out that, elsewhere in IIRIRA, Congress specifically delineates when it wants the statute to apply prospectively only.         And they did not do that in this case.           I'm sorry, I -- you lost --           -- me there.           Can you --           I'm looking at page - -           I'm --           I don't how --                I don't see how that undermines their point that when Congress wants to specify that something "shall apply prospectively only," as they quote, "only with respect to entries occurring on or after a date," they spell it out.                      And they did not similarly spell it out in the provision on -- that you suggest is prospective only.             Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Gossett, you have 2 minutes remaining.

DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER           Mr. Dreeben, I understood you to say a short while ago that if it were executed before the triggering event, it would be invalid because there was no probable cause.           No, you don't because then the warrant shouldn't have issued.              Well, but the facts of the triggering event are not always going to be so clean, and in many cases they're going to require an exercise of judgment by the officer.                      I mean, if the triggering event is a, you know, delivery of a bale of marijuana or something and they see a big box coming in, they're going to have say, well, is that what they're talking about or is -- you know, is that it. And the point is under the Fourth Amendment that those types of judgments are supposed to be made by the magistrate and not by the officers on the scene.           No, but there's no -- there's no probable cause until the triggering event. When -- when the triggering event takes place, you've eliminated the 16 others and you do know that it's -- it's -- there's probable cause.               How is that different from this case?             Well, that's not true.       Maybe the -- maybe the person decides he won't accept it.             So there are a lot more things than just the delivery.                      It's not entirely controlled by you.            Could you elaborate just a little bit for me on why you think this case is different from Justice Scalia's hypothetical with the 17 people?          Because my concern is there -- here you say once the triggering event takes place, then you do -- the probable cause comes to fruition or whatever.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LORI FRENO ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS           You were the Petitioner.           You were -- you were the Petitioner.           Well, if you're filing a petition, you have to have some expectation that you might end up here.            So you think you're -- you're entitled to 100 percent under Arkansas law, but -- and I take it, that would be without regard to what the Federal law required.               The Arkansas law can go beyond -- just looking at the assignment provision, beyond what the Federal law requires you do as a condition of participation in Medicaid.                Correct?           Well, if we disagree with you on that -- in other words, you're saying we don't even have to reach the anti-lien provision question.         If we think the Medicaid condition only goes to the extent payments for medical care, then you would lose without regard to the anti-lien provision?           Arkansas law, as you understand it --           -- requires a -- a full -- full assignment of any expenses the State -- or full recovery of any expenses the State has incurred. It's not -- it's a debate whether Medicaid law requires that.       And what you're saying is if we think the Medicaid law does not require it, you would lose without regard to any consideration of the anti-lien provision?           Well, that's one of the issues, and I'm trying to understand.                The Respondent's position is that the Arkansas law goes beyond what the Medicaid assignment provisions require. And I want your position on whether or not, if that's right, again without regard to the anti-lien provision, that you would lose.          It seems to me that you can -- Arkansas can go beyond what the Medicaid law requires for reimbursement, if it wants.            Okay.      So if we read the Medicaid statute to require something less than what your position is here, then you lose.            Okay.      That's without regard to the anti-lien provision, or is it because of the anti-lien provision?            Thank you, counsel.            Ms. Millett. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A.

How is it different here, where you have the dam restraining the waters for a certain period, and then it's being released later, at a subsequent time?            Why --            -- isn't that also a discharge?             Even though it's retained in a -- what -- an impoundment pool, or whatever, behind --             So, you think it's a different case if it's not a continuous motion; in other words, that the water is released -- you know, it's released on the weekends, but, during the week, it has to build up in the -- you would draw a distinction and say there's a discharge, in that case?           Counsel, you don't dispute that FERC could impose the same conditions that Maine has imposed in this case, as a matter of FERC authority.           Could they even impose something in the condition to your hydroelectric power license saying, "You must comply with State water quality standards"?           So, you're concerned about conditions -- I mean, as a practical matter, in terms of how the result in this case would change things, it's a question of whether FERC has to more or less accept what the State does, or whether FERC simply considers and decides whether it wants to impose those conditions.            You would rather be regulated more aggressively by FERC than by the Maine Board of Environmental Protection.           Does FERC --           -- as a regulator, tend to give greater priority to power considerations, as opposed to local environmental concerns?            But I don't understand, linguistically, why this isn't "putting something into the water," to the extent the dam holds back and restrains the water, then it "puts back into the water" the water that it had held back.           Here's -- I'm thinking of the Hoover Dam, and it's got these huge, you know, discharge points.           And every now and then they let the water come out.                 Isn't that a discharge?

04-1581 +++$+++                 We'll hear argument first today in No. 04-1581, Wisconsin Right to Life, Incorporated v. Federal Election Commission. Mr. Bopp. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER              I thought your point was that it was not an issue after the election.              Were you taking a position on this issue prior to the election time frame?              Had you taken out advertisements prior to that time frame?              Justice Souter.

04-1618 +++$+++               We'll hear argument next in 04-1618, Northern Insurance Company of New York v. Chatham County, Georgia. Mr. Estrada. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER           I assume it's -- I assume it's sort of a -- a case-by-case inquiry.                In other words, the county could be an arm of the State for some purposes but not others.            It's just a -- it's just a close textual reading of the Eleventh Amendment. Right?            It says a State.   It doesn't say county.                Thank you, counsel. Mr. Himmelfarb. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER           You don't doubt that a county could have sovereign immunity if it qualified as an arm of the State in a particular instance.                Your -- your friend in the -- in the red brief, though, reviews a lot of old cases, suggesting at the time of the founding, that counties were not subject to suit.              Thank you, Mr. Hart. Mr. Estrada, you have 8 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER              You're -- are you suggesting that the -- the State would enjoy sovereign immunity in proprietary activities?              But I would have thought, particularly when we're talking about the arm of the State doctrine, that the -- the nature of the activity is one of the key questions we look at.              Maintaining bridges is one thing.            You know, operating a for-profit activity would be something else.
04-1704 +++$+++             We'll hear argument first this morning in 04-1704, Chrysler versus -- DaimlerChrysler versus Cuno, and 04-1724, Wilkins versus Cuno. Mr. Olson. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 04-1704           With respect to the claims that are before us.             But there was standing below for the municipal taxpayers with respect to their challenge to the property taxes.           Right.           So, why isn't -- these       -- why aren't the present claims brought under -- you know, within the same nucleus of operative facts, the same sort of supplemental jurisdiction that allows the Federal court to consider purely State law claims if they have jurisdiction of another related Federal claim?           But just to get -- I mean, you don't dispute the standing of the municipal taxpayers on the property tax issue?           Well, if it's an article III issue, I think that's always before us.           Well, I was thinking if your -- if the argument is that the claims that you're concerned about today can be piggybacked onto the other ones, then we do have to consider whether there's a pig to piggyback them onto.              Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Cole. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 04-1724              Do they have standing in State court?              So --              And what about the municipal taxpayers on the property tax claim that we were talking about earlier?              Do they have standing?               So, a tax -- just -- so, a taxpayer in Wyoming can't challenge the State tax, because his claim is too diffuse, but a resident in New York City can challenge the city tax, because it's not.              Well, but it would be of higher value if they invest it in Ohio.                     I mean, that's all --              Presumably, the Ohio legislators were not doing this irrationally.               That -- in some sense, at the expense of the citizens in other States.

It seems a --             Well, that's why I thought your answer would have focused on that rather than the security concerns, is that you take away what it is they want the most because that's most likely to result in them conforming their behavior so they can get it back.                Thank you, Mr. Rovelli. Mr. Marcus. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN L. MARCUS ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER            Where do you draw the line?       I take it somewhere -- you couldn't deprive them of food, if that would get them to -- to conform. Justice Souter was asking about marriage.                 I mean, how do we tell when -- when you can deprive someone of something they -- to modify their behavior and when it goes too far?                Mr. Rovelli, you have 2 minutes remaining.

04-433 +++$+++               We'll hear argument first this morning in 04-433, Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corporation. Mr. Frederick. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS            Mr. Frederick, I understand how your arguments work under section 1962(c), but how -- how do they work under 1962(a)?                  It seems that that gets around many of the causation and reliance arguments that you make.           But 62(a) gets to the reinvestment of the illicit proceeds in a -- in an enterprise, and here you have the opening of the facility right next -- not right next door -- nearby the other facility.         And it seems to me all they have to show is that the proceeds used for that were illicitly procured.           But it's not --           I think the reason Justice Breyer's test is a little more administrable than you're willing to admit is that it's not a question of motive.         You're not asking why they did it. You're asking where the predicate act is directed, and if the predicate act is directed to lowering the -- the firm's taxes so that it can compete more aggressively, that's one thing.        If the -- the predicate act is directed to, you know, blowing up the other firm's warehouse or -- or, you know, something like that, it's a different matter altogether.              Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CINDY LEE ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS              What do you do with a public university professor, who -- is fired for the content of his lectures?               Certainly, in the course of his employment, that's what he's paid to do.                     That has no first-amendment protection?              "Should not be entitled, presumptively, to first-amendment protection," what does that mean?          That there might be first amendment protection, in light of the particular context --              -- of the speech?              I would have thought you might have argued that it's speech paid for by the Government, that's what they pay him for, it's their speech; and so, there's no first-amendment issue at all.               Thank you --               -- Ms. Lee. Mr. Himmelfarb. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS           And it's going to be clear that that's violating your job, and it has an adverse impact on your job-related duties, because you're going public, instead of going through the channels.             How comfortable are you that this line you're trying to draw is one that's going to be workable in practice?                I mean, suppose the employee writes a memo, and the boss comes and says, "If you don't promise me you're not going to talk about this publicly, you're fired."            And he says, "Well, I'm not going to promise that."            And so, he's fired.         Now, is that internal, or is that external?            Right.            That's --            -- required by his job. But "promise that he's not going to talk about it" is not required by his job.            And this case, kind of, raises the question, because the only reason it's squarely presented on the memo is because the Court didn't reach the Brady disclosure or the talk to the bar association that were related to the memo.           Yes.              Ms. Lee, you have one minute left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CINDY S. LEE ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

They seem either redundant or overlapping. The theory on the other side at least distinguishes them and argues that they apply in different circumstances.           What about the contention in the particular proceeding that the district court -- or the State fact finder did not, in fact, make a determination, but simply gave the benefit of the doubt to the prosecutor?

Couldn't that CEO, the individual, claim that that policy interferes with his ability to make contracts with his company to be the CEO?                And shouldn't he then have a right to bring a claim under section 1981?              Well, maybe not -- maybe not shareholders in general, but what if you have a situation, like here, where you're dealing with sole shareholders?            Why is that a real stretch to say that that person is a third party beneficiary of the contracts of his corporation?            There was nothing in these contracts requiring anything in the way of personal guarantees or anything of that sort?           But is it State law today or State law back when section 1981 was passed?              Ms. Mahoney, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E.

OLSON ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER           Well, Mr. Olson, the Solicitor General tells us that -- and here we have -- you have the statute, but they have the Kaul case that suggests that this tax is imposed on the reservation.           Mr. Olson, what does it mean when they say, in law, the "incidence of the taxes on the distributor"?          Does that mean anything other than that he has to pay it?           Well, I guess the reason for my question is, they look back at the court's decisions and see that it turns on where the incidence of the tax is.           And so, there's some bright lawyer in Kansas who said, "All we have to do is pass a law saying the incidence is -- of the tax is on the distributor, and we're going to win."              So, it suggests that we shouldn't give too much weight to that.            Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Olson, you have four and a half minutes left.

FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS           So, I take it your answer to Justice Souter is yes.                In other words, if the mistake that the court made was relying on 1441(b), it was a similar mistake for you, in your opening brief, to put such weight on that language in 1441(b).             Mr. Frederick, earlier you made the point that Lincoln was a proper "real party in interest."              I take it that's not critical to your position.               Your argument would be the same if they weren't a real party in interest, wouldn't it?             But if they -- if they don't have a proper defendant, they should do that?             I presume, then --             -- that the plaintiff loses, not that you get to have the court find the proper defendant for the plaintiff.           What -- I know you contend that's not the case, but let's say there is a in-State subsidiary that's completely responsible for all the challenged actions, and the in-State plaintiff sues an -- only the out-of-State parent. What happens in that case?            Thank you, Mr. Joseph. Mr. Frederick, you have nine minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

That would be a whole different situation, right?                What --                -- good would the -- what good would the presumption do if it's just a presumption?              Presumably, if it's a presumption, the prisoner is --                -- going to say, "Well, here's why you shouldn't follow the presumption in my case," just as, if it looks like he's waited a long time, he's going to say, "Well, here's why that delay was reasonable."                I don't know that the presumption you're proposing serves much of a purpose.                No, it doesn't --                -- not if the prisoner says, "Here's why you shouldn't follow the presumption."           Why would you have to apply that?           It's a Federal question whether the claim is pending or not during that whole period, right?              -- Mr. Stris. Ms. Chatman, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE BAKER CHATMAN ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER              Well, the ones that would cite a case that threw out the petition because it was untimely -- and we were told there were over a thousand of those every year -- that would be saying something, wouldn't it?

Right.           Isn't there always a private -- I mean, we're talking about tort law -- isn't there always a private analog, which is, you know, exercising reasonable care under the circumstances toward people to whom you owe some duty, and you just apply that general principle?            Well, all right, so if it's a police officer stopping somebody on a highway, it's the same as a private security guard stopping somebody at a -- you know, the driveway at a plant or something.           Thank you, Mr. Cotter. Ms. Maynard, you have five minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER           You consider affidavits on a motion to dismiss?

Well, in the Citizens Publishing case, it wasn't a necessary predicate of the Court's ruling there to find that the joint venture was unlawful, was it?           Well, the two parties obviously don't compete within the terms of the joint venture, but they compete more generally.           And you couldn't have two companies say we're not going to -- we're going to have a joint venture on this corner, but in -- you know, down the block, we're going to compete, and then it's all right to set prices on this corner but not down the block.

04-848 +++$+++             We'll hear argument today in Dolan versus United States Postal Service. Mr. Radmore. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. RADMORE ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER              How -- wait, I -- it's not true that only mail can be lost, or only mail can be delivered to the wrong location.                   If you order from a private delivery service, they can do all of those things, as well.              What do you consider covered by negligent transmission?                I take it if the -- if the postal worker throws the package to the house and there's something in it that gets broken, that's covered by the exception?          Right.   But if -- now, if they throw the package onto the porch, and it lands in a place where somebody's going to trip over it, you say that's not covered by the exception.           What does "negligent transmission" add to "loss" or "miscarriage"?           But I supposed "miscarriage" does.           Or mis-carried, like handled in a way that it's damaged, or put in a place where it's going to be damaged.                It seems to me that -- I'm not sure what additional weight "negligent transmission" covers if you have a reasonable reading of "miscarriage."           No, that doesn't work. I mean, if you deliver it to the house next door, you haven't lost it, you've misdelivered it or miscarried it. I don't -- I don't think "miscarriage" is redundant.                      But you -- your construction of "negligent transmission" is so narrow that I'm not sure it adds anything to "miscarriage," which suggests it might --               What about "delay"? Does "delay" -- your -- isn't that something that's neither within "loss" or "miscarriage"?               But I guess -- I -- following up on Justice Stevens' question, your theory with respect to negligent transmission is that the Postal Service should be liable in the same way that private parties are.              But that theory doesn't hold up when you're talk -- that's not your theory.               Well, then, what is your --               Well, that's --               I would have thought that was miscarriage.               Or loss.          Well, it's only superfluous under your reading.               If it covers, for example, putting the package -- negligently placing the package in a location where it's going to cause injury, well, then it's not superfluous.          No.          I was just -- it wouldn't make it superfluous at all.                   "Loss" would cover loss.       "Miscarriage" would cover damage.

So the -- so the -- we would have to be finding in this case, if we ruled in your favor, that we think the trial judge is unreasonable.           Counsel, could I step -- step back a little bit to get -- to get back to the standard of review?          Because I think it's an unusual one.      You started out by talking about what the first jury knew and didn't know, but we are in no sense reviewing that jury determination.                    Correct?           We are supposed to look at all of the evidence, the new evidence and the old evidence, and determine simply whether or not it would be unreasonable for any juror to vote to convict on the basis of all of that evidence.                   Is that right?           So, in other words, no reasonable juror -- no -- no juror could reasonably vote to convict.        In other words, if we look at this evidence and think that -- and again, we're not reviewing the prior jury's evidence.                  If we look at this and say, maybe a jury would come out 10 to 2 in favor of acquittal, if we think that would be reasonable, then you lose.               Right?           Under my hypothetical there are two reasonable jurors who vote to convict.            Mr. Kissinger, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          You concede, though, don't you, Mr. Englert, that the language of the statute covers the conduct here?          Well, you have a person who's engaged in commerce, who's discriminating in the price that they offer to different purchasers.                   Now, I know your argument about the structure, but the actual language does seem to encompass the activity.          Well, just to --          -- get to your first point, the statute talks about discrimination in price between different purchasers, and not different actual purchases.          It doesn't seem it's that much of a stretch to cover would-be purchasers, potential purchasers.         I understand --             I understand your argument that there's no injury or impact in competition for resale of the trucks.         What's wrong with looking at the statute as being concerned to protect competition to be the Volvo dealer?                   In other words, you know, they're competing -- if Volvo's restructuring its approach, they're competing to be the favored dealer, even though they don't compete with other Volvo dealers directly.             Thank you. Mr. Hungar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER         Just so --         And the -- and the main failing there is that Volvo Trucks and Reeder-Simco do not compete in the same market for sales of Volvo trucks.               Is that a correct statement of the record?         For any --         -- particular sales.         I see.           Okay.         Sure.         Thank you, Mr. Hungar.

04-944 +++$+++              We'll hear argument first today in Arbaugh v. Y & H Corporation. Mr. Joseffer.             Mr. Schwartz.   Excuse me.     Mr. Schwartz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. SCHWARTZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER              What about the argument, though, that when you're talking about a threshold question like coverage, who the statute covers, and it's quite different from the cause of action cases, many of which you rely on in your brief?              It's more a question of -- of whether or not the -- there's been a violation of title VII.          It seems to me that the number of employee issue is whether you're covered at all, whether you have to conform your conduct to that law. Your question -- your -- your case of whether someone has been discharged or not just goes to whether there's been a violation.            But in City of -- in City of Kenosha, of course, the Court went beyond the jurisdictional grant and it said that the definition of the term person in 1983 raised a jurisdictional question.           But -- but maybe -- but that doesn't sound like a reasonable agreement. All you -- so you file one sentence saying this person violated title VII.          Are you impliedly including all of the allegations of what constitutes a violation of title VII because if you didn't allege every particular element, it wouldn't be a violation of title VII? That's not how pleading works.           That's true in a lot of areas.         I think of admiralty.         If there's an issue of admiralty jurisdiction that questions whether an injury is caused by a vessel in navigable water, you often have extended litigation over that jurisdictional question.              Thank you, Mr. Schwartz. Now Mr. Joseffer. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PLAINTIFF           Interpreted section -- the use of the word person in section 1983.           So City of Kenosha was just kind of a silly waste of time.           1331 was applicable there as well.         Right?           I'm sorry.   What have juries been determining?           Right.           But that's the -- that's a consequence of a determination that it's jurisdictional in any case.               Right?           I mean, if you had a case where you didn't dispute that the issue was jurisdictional and there had been a jury trial on the pendant State law claims, we'd still have to throw that out.      Right?            Mr. Schwartz, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. SCHWARTZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
04-9728 +++$+++               We'll hear argument first this morning in Samson versus California. Mr. Long. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR., ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER            Mr. Long --              Well, but --              -- their condition is very different, in a broad range of areas.                   They -- you give up First Amendment rights.                  For example, it's typical to have a condition of parole that you don't consort with known criminals or gang members.                     You -- often it says you must refrain from alcohol.                      Sometimes they say you can't go near particular places, if they think that's going to tempt you to return to a life of crime.       Those are all First Amendment rights that are sacrificed while you're on parole.                    Why is this any different?              What about a drug -- what if you're convicted of a drug offense, you're on parole, and one of the conditions is, every week you have to go in for a drug test?              Do you --              -- do you -- is that acceptable?              But it would be a Fourth Amendment right that you would be giving up --              -- that you would otherwise have if you weren't on parole.               Well, but it's -- I mean, the point --               But Justice Stevens's question highlights the point that you criticize about: the randomness of it is often a critical element.                         I suppose it makes much more sense to say you're subject to a random drug test than that you have to come in at a scheduled time, when you -- presumably, you could refrain from using drugs prior to the test.                     And, to some extent, it's the same, even if you're not talking about a drug test.              The search is only going to be effective if it's not announced or --              -- scheduled.              Well --              Well, the --              -- California --              The California Supreme Court said that the Fourth Amendment applied to these searches, but it only protected in a limited way, along the same lines as we said in Griffin.                     And the standard they applied was, it protected against arbitrary or harassing or capricious searches --              -- which seems to go to your argument, which is centered around the unbridled discretion of the officer.                      And the California Supreme Court is saying it's not unbridled.              Well, that's --              -- fine.    But it turns out he stops the guy every hour of the day, then he has a pretty strong case that this is for harassment, and it's not --              -- for the special law enforcement --              -- need that accompanies releasing parolees.              No, but your point was that this is the core of the Fourth Amendment, and they're taking away all of the protection and leaving it to the unbridled discretion.                  And that turns out to be not the case.         Under the law that authorizes the procedure, the California Supreme Court interpretation is that the Fourth Amendment provides protection against harassment or arbitrary and --              -- capricious searches.              Then which way do you think that cuts?          There's --              -- never been a case of a harassing search of a parolee.              I mean, that's what - - or 200 cases in the --              -- in --              Thank you, Mr. Marcus. Mr. Long, you have 2 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A.

05-1074 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument next in Ledbetter versus Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. Mr. Russell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL, ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                  So if 15 years earlier a discriminatory decision was made to give a pay raise of 4 percent rather than 5 percent, and that over the 15 years became the basis with other raises, you think you can challenge the discrimination 15 years later and say well, this was discriminatory because 15 years ago I didn't get a raise and that, carried forward, had a ripple effect into the current 180-day period.                   Well, Congress could have specifically provided for the Equal Pay Act rule under Title VII, but it didn't do that.                    I suppose all they'd have to do is allege that sometime over the past -- I mean, it doesn't have to be 15 years.                     It could be 40 years, right -- that there was a discriminatory act, in one of the semi-annual pay reviews I was denied this, a raise that I should have gotten.   It may have been 20 years ago.                  It may have been 40 years ago.                    Why is that if they just discovered it?           I just learned about what happened 30 years ago at this company and it's -- I filed right away.     There's no laches.                    But then they have to go back and litigate what happened 30 years ago.                  That's not your theory.   I mean, if it happened once 20 years ago you have a case that you can bring, isn't it?                  You've got a memo that says we're going to pay, 20 years ago, we're going to pay males this much and we're going to pay females this much, and she says that obviously affected my pay over the ensuing 15, 20 years.                  And it's not enough presumably for somebody to come in and even up everybody?     I mean, if you see that the women are making 20 percent less than the men you don't escape liability by paying everybody the same going forward, because perhaps if nondiscriminatory decisions had been made the women would have making 20 percent more than the men.     You have to go back and revisit every pay decision or you're exposed to liability for current pay.                 Why is that true? I mean, it depends.      I suppose it may be harder for the company to mount a defense over time, so it may be to her advantage to wait.                 Lorance?                 Thank you, counsel. Mr. Russell, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 You can equalize pay by lowering others.        You don't -- raising the discriminated-against class is not the only way to equalize pay.   So I don't see how cost is a justification for continuing the disparity.                  Under Title VII you can equalize either way, right?
05-1120 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument first today in 05-1120, Massachusetts versus Environmental Protection Agency.                Mr. Milkey. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. MILKEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   Do you get the benefit of that broader allegation in establishing your standard?   In other words, if you've challenged EPA's refusal to apply a particular level of greenhouse regulation to a particular model of car, can you say, well, they're following the same approach to a coal powered -- coal fueled power plant, and so we get to establish a broader injury?             Or, aren't you limited to the specific legal challenge you're raising here?                   Don't you have to show injury from their decision here?                   The fact that other people, or you presumably as well might be injured by their decisions that you are not challenging here, that doesn't help your standing here, does it?                  Those affidavits talked about the fact that if the government starts to regulate, the technology is going to change, if the technology changes, other governments will adopt it, and all that, and that strikes me as sort of spitting out conjecture on conjecture, the sort that we disapproved of.                   Same argument if the automobile emissions were 1 percent contributors?                   How is that consistent with our taxpayer standing cases where the argument is that a taxpayer doesn't have standing to challenge an illegal expenditure as a general matter simply because his contribution, the benefit that he's claiming is so small and so widely dispersed?                   That assumes everything else is going to remain constant, though, right?   It assumes there isn't going to be a greater contribution of greenhouse gases from economic development in China and other places that's going to displace whatever marginal benefit you get here.                   Not if your harm is the alleged loss of coastline.              Not necessarily.      It depends upon what happens across the globe with respect to greenhouse emissions.                  What's your strongest case from this Court to support your standing allegation?                  Laidlaw was a specific citizen suit provision, wasn't it?                   So doesn't that make it somewhat analytically distinct from this case?                   Moving from your authority argument to the exercise of authority, the clause 202(a)(1) requires EPA to prescribe standards which in their judgment cause or contribute to air pollution reasonably anticipated to endanger public health.    And they say they haven't made that judgment yet, so they're not in violation of that statutory command.                   Let's say the first day this law is passed, there are a lot of air pollutants that come out of motor vehicles.                  I mean, is EPA immediately in violation of this statute if they don't issue emissions regulations for every one those air pollutants on day one?                    And presumably the principle that they want to deal with what they regard as the more serious threats sooner.                       They want to deal with lead first and then they want to deal with other stuff.   I mean, what is the -- when did they -- I guess -- move into an abuse of discretion in not exercising a judgment with respect to a particular pollutant?                   That's not all they said.    I'm looking at A-85 and they said establishing emissions now would require EPA to make scientific and technical judgments without the benefit of studies that are being developed to reduce the uncertainty in the area.    That's different than saying they disagree with the regulatory approach.                   There's a difference between the scientific status of the harm from lead emissions from vehicles that -- when you have lead in the gasoline, to the status, the status of scientific knowledge with respect to the impact on global warming today?   Those are two very different levels of uncertainty.                     What they said was until more is understood about causes, extent and significance of climate change and the potential options for addressing it, we believe it's inappropriate to regulate these emissions.                     That strikes me as saying they think there is too much uncertainty for them to act.

OWEN ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS                   How would you compare that evidence with the evidence in Penry itself?                   These are closer cases than Penry, I think.            You'd have to concede that, wouldn't you?                   In Brewer --                   Go ahead.                     But in, in Brewer's case, it's, quoting the record, evidence of one hospitalization for a single episode of nonpsychotic major depression.    So it was certainly opened for a jury to determine that as mitigating and not aggravating in assessing the likelihood that there was going to be further violent behavior.                     Quite a bit different than Penry.                   And your submission -- your submission is that every juror is, or a reasonable juror is going to look at that, and the only conclusion that they are going to draw is that he is more likely to be violent in the future?                As opposed to the conclusion that there is mitigating evidence because of this, that he should -- mercy should be shown to him in light of all of this?        And I just don't see how you can speculate which way the jury is going to go.                   So that was in, in Brewer.   Now --                   -- there was no reliance or no similar statement by the prosecutor in Abdul-Kabir or Mr. Cole's case.                   So do we have different results in these two consolidated cases?                   So the, so the -- but my point is the absence of a similar prosecutorial statement in the Cole case cuts against you.                   Where is evidence of abatement in that case that was before the jury?                   So that if you ask them, was it this person's fault in some moral sense, that might affect whether they wish to show mercy?     And if you ask them whether he is going to grow out of it, they may well say, it was not his fault because of this brain disorder and he is going to grow out of it and that was the evidence, and so we are not going to sentence him to death.                    But in Penry we didn't establish a per se rule.              We said it depends upon the evidence.   It depends upon the instructions.                 It depends upon what the prosecutors say.                  It seems to me that you're arguing for an absolute rule.                     But it's not no reasonable probability, that's not the standard.                    The standard under Smith is whether the juries can consider this mitigating evidence in some manner.                   Thank you, Mr. Marshall. You Mr. Owen, have you 12 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWEN ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS                  How old was Brewer at that time?                   But the argument is that the jury hearing this evidence in light of all the instructions will only conclude that the evidence shows that he will be violent again.               They will not feel that they can take it into account in any way to determine that it's a situation in which they should extend mercy, or that, I guess it was, I get the Cole and the Brewer records confused here, but that this, the cause for the violence will abate with, with age.                   Or that in, I guess in Brewer's case in particular, that since the violence was caused by a particular bout of depression, that would not necessarily recur.                    -- that was after -- I guess the question would be under Johnson, whether or not it could be considered in some manner.
05-11304 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument first this morning in 05-11304, Smith versus Texas. Mr. Steiker. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JORDAN STEIKER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   You agree that the application of the harmless error analysis is a question of State law, though, correct?                   They applied, they applied a legal standard, the egregious harm standard, that depends on failure of an objection. So I would have thought they, they certainly thought that there was an inadequate objection, or they wouldn't have applied that standard.                  Why is that -- just, why is that too burdensome?                What's so burdensome about saying I object to that instruction?                  You're saying, there is a difference between saying it would have been futile and saying it's high and burdensome, and I'm just wondering what your specific point is.                 Well, but it didn't have to reach the harmless error question after it made an erroneous determination that there was no error at all.      When the case came up here and the Court determined there was error, then it was necessary to reach it.       I don't see that it's changing its position at all.                     Wouldn't it be normal exercise of judicial restraint to say, we don't have to reach out and decide whether this error was harmless if we've already decided there's no error at all?                  And it's a very bad -- I think in the long term in the broad category of cases, it would be a very bad solution for defendants, because what's going to happen, once a court's determined there's no error at all, it's much easier for them to say, oh and by the way if there was it's harmless.      And if they did that and then it turns out there was an error, you're going to be back here saying, well, don't be bound by their harmless error decision because they thought there was no error at all, so they didn't focus on it carefully. I would say the way they approached it in this case is the more desirable way.                      If you don't think there's an error don't go on and decide whether it's harmless or not in the abstract.                  But even if it is, logically anterior to consideration of that procedural impediment is a particular ruling on the merits and the State court didn't make that merits. They thought there was no error.              It is logically not necessary for them to decide whether an error is harmless if they don't think there's an error, and to say that they waive that, that later ground I would have thought would be very surprising.                 Why do we remand these cases for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion if there's nothing further to be considered?                  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Steiker, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JORDAN STEIKER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    What about General, Mr. Cruz's comments that this was a minor point in counsel's summation before the jury?

Is your argument an argument that the Texas State court was wrong on its ruling under Texas State law harmless error.

FLAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                      Well, but      he did not know that for years later.                I mean, they don't have to bring a prosecution immediately.                       They can wait until the day before the statute of limitations runs.                      Well, then they can wait a long time. (Laughter.)                      But the point, the whole point of Heck was to avoid 1983 becoming an end run around habeas.      But here you don't have that problem because you don't have any available relief under habeas under Stone versus Powell.                  Yeah, it would require overruling our cases that say for tolling, your borrow state law --                   So then you deny the officers the purpose you have for the reason you have statutes of limitation, which is repose.                They are going to wait ten years instead of the two years to find out if they are going to have to answer any claim for damages.                  But he's never going to know, in the case where there's no statute of limitations, he's never going to know when his criminal case is going to be over because he may never know when it's going to start.                   So what happens if he files a suit after one year and then after one year and 350 days he's prosecuted?             His action accrued but then it didn't accrue?                   So his action accrued and maybe it's even over, but then it turns out when they bring the prosecution, it should have never have been brought because it never accrued.

You're going to award a higher multiple with respect to the damages --                    -- based on the conduct to others.     Why wouldn't a normal juror think --                    Excuse me.   Why wouldn't a normal jury view that as punishing the defendant for the harm to others?                Mr. Frey, I suppose your theory here depends on the nature of the underlying tort, I suppose, in that there are, you argue, defenses that might be available with respect to other, other individuals who are harmed.                So this argument wouldn't apply in a case if the underlying tort weren't susceptible to those sorts of defenses.                  Thank you, Mr. Peck. Mr. Frey, you have four minutes remaining.

05-1272 +++$+++                    We will hear argument next in 05-1272, Rockwell International Corporation versus United States. Ms. Mahoney. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS                   It wouldn't have to have anything to do with pondcrete at all.                The statute just says the information on which his allegations are based.   They don't say the allegations that eventually give rise to a recovery.                  That's one way to look at it.    Another way would be you would allow a relator in a situation who alleges a particular fraud that causes the government to examine the books and uncovers a different fraud to recover on that basis. It's an unusual situation to have a jurisdictional prerequisite determined only after the case is over.                   If you only show that it's wrong at the end, you still say that they should be thrown out.                   Well, his allegation was that this, the design is not going to work.                   That's not an allegation that's -- I mean, it is either true or it's not true.     The fact that you find out after he's left, after he's been terminated, that it doesn't work, I don't see how that should affect the validity of his allegations.                   They were certifying their compliance with the applicable laws --   -- based upon their pondcrete design.                    The whole purpose, the whole purpose of this legislation is to ferret out fraud on the Government.         I mean, if he makes an allegation that this design is not going to work, the pondcrete is not going to work, and the Government, prompted by his lawsuit, investigates it and finds out that because of human error they're not making it the right way, even if the design does work, he get no credit for that?                    Well, what about the hypothetical?   Are you suggesting that in a situation like that -- -we'll talk about whether the facts comport with it later -- but in a situation like that, he's not entitled to share in the recovery that the Government eventually receives?                  You would, you would change that to say direct knowledge of the information not on which the allegations are based, but on which recovery is eventually -- eventually ordered?                     Identified them all?                     They've identified them all already? (Laughter.)                  Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Ms. Mahoney, you have 4 minutes remaining.

FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   So it's perfectly all right for them to adopt a new method of testing tar and nicotine that yields numbers that are far lower than the Government's method, and to publish an ad saying these are our tar and nicotine figures, and the FTC would have no problem with that?                   Not just the preferred method, but presumably the only one they would allow.   If you used another one, they would bring a deceptive trade practices action very quickly.                  They still might have gotten it right. (Laughter.)                  Well, I understand you have a dispute about whether that is this case, but there are many areas where the Government requires testing of products.       You know, the strength of seat belts and stuff, and they specify very precise means to which those tests have to be conducted. And if someone, a manufacturer is complying with those requirements, and a challenge is brought, saying something to the effect that that test doesn't give you a good measure or something, in that situation would this removal provision apply?                  What if the Government says you've got to test your cars, you know, every three months or something, and you've got to send us the results of a random -- random test?                  Well, that doesn't seem to be a distinction.          The drug companies -- the Government wants to make sure that drugs are safe and effective and so they issue regulations saying here's how you have to test it.         They're just, you could say, delegating the testing to the companies.                   There's a difference between you are providing products and complying with testing.    In other words, and if, in fact, the Government specifies precisely how the testing is supposed to be done to determine whether it, the Government, will approve the marketing of a particular drug, and the challenge, the litigation is to the testing.    Somebody sues as drugs company and says you know, you tested this drug wrong, we think you should have tested it some other way, and the drug company says the Government told us how to test it -- why in that situation aren't they acting under a Government official?                  Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Gornstein. ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN, ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS                    What's -- what's your conclusion?

So if you are a federally certified inspector you are acting under --                    What about private transportation of mail?

05-130 +++$+++               We'll hear argument next in eBay v. MercExchange. Mr. Phillips. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS           Well, but -- but the exercise of discretion is channeled over time, as -- as judges apply it in -- in similar cases.                You're not suggesting that in a typical run-of-the-mine patent case, no special considerations, it would be wrong to say that in those cases you typically would grant an injunction?                Well, but he said other things too, and one thing he said is, I don't like business method patents very much, and so I'm not going to give an injunction here.                Do you think that was proper or improper?               He said there's a growing concern over the issuance of business method patents.               Is that an appropriate consideration to take into account in determining whether to grant an injunction or not?               Well, then he went on and he said --               -- another -- another consideration is that this patentee does not practice its patents.             But, I mean, isn't that just saying he's, you know, the -- the guy in the garage and he's an inventor and the way he's going to market his discoveries is by getting some firm that basically speculates on patents.           And if he's denying that inventor, you know, the -- what he'd give to Bell Labs -- or whatever Bell Labs is these days -- that does practice the inventions --           Why should we -- if I can get back to one of the factors.                    Why should we draw a distinction between the -- the sole inventor who needs a patent speculation firm to market his discovery and -- and somebody else?            Why -- why should he lose the leverage of the normal injunction and have substituted for that a duel of experts over what a reasonable royalty should be?            Can I -- maybe I don't understand what it means to practice the invention.          If -- if I -- does that -- if -- if I invent something, you know, a new -- better way to make a car engine work and I want to sell that to somebody, that's -- you'd say that's not practicing the invention because I don't build cars?

05-1342 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument next in 05-1342, Watters v. Wachovia Bank. Mr. Blanchard. ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOHN BLANCHARD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Why did they do that?   What's the advantage to them having that subsidiary rather than doing this directly?                   So mortgage subsidiary could possibly get into some trouble that the bank wants to protect itself from and not have -- they have a certain number of assets that are subject to liability in the subsidiary, but they would -- otherwise they'd expose the whole bank to those liabilities?                     You're not seeking visit -- "visitorial," is that the word?                     You're not seeking visitorial rights with respect to the parent bank.                     You're not arguing that because you need to see more about the mortgage subsidiary you need to see what the parent is up to?                    Okay.                    Their argument, they haven't argued -- I realize this was a hypothetical, but they haven't argued that the subsidiary should be treated as a national bank.             They're arguing that they're entitled to say that the same preemption that applies to the national bank applies to the subsidiaries.                    Presumably, if they said it's treated as a national bank they would lose the benefit of the separate corporate existence when it came to issues of liability.        If they said this subsidiary is a national bank, then presumably the separate corporate existence they're seeking to take advantage of would be obliterated.                      And if they don't want to, they don't have to set up a separate subsidiary, right?      They can do this business directly as a national bank and they're not going to be subject to any visitation?                      Right.   And I would have thought your answer to Justice Breyer was yes, that they get to regulate to the extent they want to, and the state does, and if there's a conflict, the federal regulation will prevail, but what's the problem here is that they're issuing a categorical regulation saying the state can't regulate at all.                  Their position is not that it only preempts in cases of conflict.                 Under 12c apart, 7.4006, it says, state laws apply to national bank operated subsidiaries, which is what we're dealing with here, to the same extent that those laws apply to the parent national bank, which is to say not at all.                  So it's not a case of conflict preemption.        They're trying to preempt state law whether it conflicts or not, right?                     Or environmental regulation where just because the Federal EPA doesn't take a particular action against a polluter, doesn't mean that the state can't take action against the polluter.                    So if the Federal U.S. Attorney prosecutes, decides to prosecute someone for manslaughter, the state can decide that's not an adequate enough response and prosecute them for murder, right?                  You better hurry then.                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Blanchard, you have a minute remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOHN BLANCHARD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EVAN TAGER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   Well, but you don't even have to get into the theory.               What happens in a lot of municipalities of course is that they decide, well, we're going to run the waste treatment facility and we're going to tax the people in the municipality to support it and the service is going to be free.                  Now, is that a violation of the Commerce Clause?                   Yes.                  Well, so, you say formalistic as if it's a bad thing.                      But the, the distinction, say in the First Amendment, if the private contractor the day before the municipality bought the facility for a dollar had fired an employee because of his or her political views, you wouldn't argue that that is state action just because the next day it was going to be controlled by the public entity.                     And yet the next day, that type of action would be subject to First Amendment scrutiny.      It may be a formalistic distinction but in many areas of the law it makes all the difference.                     It is kind of formalistic on the other side because you, I thought you agreed that if the municipality did it through tax revenues and there was no formal flow restriction and yet it only made sense to dump your waste at the free facility, you seem to suggest that would be okay.

MILLER BAKER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                     Right --                     I thought your argument was, once you make a decision to terminate, there are various rules that are triggered, you just can't take the money and run with it.                    You've got to make provision.   And that merger was not one of the permitted ways of terminating a plan.                    Is that wrong?                  But the point is the $5 million is not going to these employees, it's being thrown into this vast sea of all these other employees, whose employers have not done as good a job of funding their plans.

That says that the Secretary in making this determination can take into account particular types of LEAs where there is extra, additional costs.                  I would have thought for example if you had a very small LEA with only 20 students and the cost is particularly high because you don't have economies of scale, that you haven't -- that would, could be knocked out for that reason.   Is that not how that works?                    Mr. Van Amberg, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. VAN AMBERG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                   What about the underlying principle that waivers of sovereign immunity are strictly construed.       And when you have a waiver on the broader statute, but shouldn't you read them together with the specific to suggest that they weren't waiving sovereign immunity when a more specific statute governed, except to the extent of the provisions in that more specific statute.                    Well, but there may be situations where the Government, having levied, doesn't feel the need to pursued other remedies available to it.   And if you then allow a challenge to the levy to come in later the person they would have proceeded against if they didn't have the levy may have left the country, may have dissipated the funds that they would otherwise go after.              They need to know early on that they are barking up the wrong tree if they have levied on the wrong property, and that's why you have a short statute to clear that up as soon as possible.                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ainsa, you have 5 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS S. AINSA, JR.,. ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

CATTANI ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    Justice Souter's question highlights an ambiguity in this Ninth Circuit opinion, for me anyway.        Do you understand the hearing that they directed to be on the waiver question, or is the hearing that they directed on the alleged mitigation evidence that he now wants to present?                    If he wants, if he wants a hearing on that, we'd have to reverse the Ninth Circuit, right?   Because the Ninth Circuit held that he didn't waive --                   -- this claim?                   The part of the opinion that Justice Alito quoted on page A-17.                      That's not what I understood his argument that he wants to raise to be. In his affidavit, it is a different argument.                   It is the biological component of violence.                  "Look, my grandfather was convicted, my father was convicted," and so the mitigating evidence he wants to present at sentencing that is I'm biologically predetermined to commit crimes.                  That -- which is certainly an ambiguous argument to present in mitigation at a sentencing hearing.

MCKENNA, ESQ. ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS                    Well, do you see an underlying constitutional problem as to non-election expenditures that are still political expenditures?                    Didn't we take one in Abood?                    Didn't we take a position in Abood?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                   Well, the only thing that the Ninth Circuit held was that the definition of a theft offense in California is broader than the generic definition of theft.        All of these arguments that are being discussed are ways in which that particular ruling is supported.    I don't know why they wouldn't be considered subsumed under the Ninth Circuit's decision.                  Counsel, you're ahead of me, and I'm still back on the last question, but I take it your rationale for not reaching these other grounds would also apply to your argument that whatever the categorical definition, that this defendant was convicted of an actual theft offense, looking at the charging documents.      That wasn't a basis for the Ninth Circuit's decision either.                      Certainly.

He just wasn't going to stop.       Does that make it a different case?                   Is it reasonable for him to suppose that there might be something more going on if the guy is trying this hard to get away from a speeding ticket?

SHELLEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            But this is a fairly indirect way of establishing a Federal cause of action. I mean, it -- it's a preemption provision.                    Why isn't it reasonable to assume Congress thought there was no need for a Federal cause of action?                     Because it's a contract action.          State courts handle those every day, and they assumed they'd be handled by State court.            I noticed you referred in your brief to the Jackson Transit line of authority.          Do you know how many times Jackson Transit has been cited in the last 20 years by this Court?                It's not been cited. I think it's never been applied and it's not been cited once in 20 years.                So what's the line of authority?                We're not talking about the contract between you and the Federal Government.              We're talking about some other agreement between you and an individual employee.                Well, that may give rise to a separate agreement, a related agreement, if you will, between you and the employee.                      But it's not -- it's not a -- you're not the Government.                      The employee is not the Government, at least not for these purposes.         So why is it a Government contract?           So if the Government says -- Congress says, we think OPM should have a recreation center for its employees and it should have all these things, and then OPM enters into a contract with a company that runs recreation centers -- okay -- that's a contract with the Government.                 And then that entity enters into a contract with somebody else to supply the basketball hoops.               Would you say that that last contract is a Government contract?           Yes.           Even if the provision -- even if at some point Congress said, and besides, you know, the basketball hoops should be -- you know, made in America as opposed to somewhere else and, you know, specifies the terms of the subcontract.                Could you -- following up on Justice Ginsburg's question, could you intervene asserting rights of subrogation in the underlying tort suit that your covered beneficiary brought in State court?                Well, wouldn't it be more efficient for you to intervene in the pending State suit and get it all resolved at once rather than waiting until your beneficiary gets a recovery and then starting a whole other Federal suit over this somewhat subsidiary subrogation point?               Well, at that point, you'd be able to assert your argument under the Federal preemption provision that says, in my view somewhat surprisingly, that these contract terms preempt State law.           That would have been a good time for them to say we want a Federal -- Federal court jurisdiction over these causes of actions if that's what they had in mind, but they didn't do that.             Oh, there sure was. For those who like to look at the legislative history, the House report said that -- again, it's very curious language.         It said, this change will help strengthen the case in favor of Federal jurisdiction, or something like that.             Well, since when is Congress trying to strengthen -- they either decide it's going to be Federal jurisdiction or not.                  They don't try to make arguments.           Is --           Is there any comparable situation where a contract between two private parties has the effect of preempting State law? Suppose all you have to do in your service benefit plan is agree with your beneficiaries that in the case of subrogation, you're entitled to, you know, 10 times actual damages, if they don't pay up right away or something like that.         And -- and that would override all sorts of State law.           You could specify you're entitled to interest at 20 percent and that would preempt State usury laws?                Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER            Isn't there -- isn't that a big leap?          I mean, even if we agree with you that there are Federal rights and duties, is it irrational for Congress to determine, since they arise in a normal breach of contract action, we're going to assume they're going to be brought in State court?                  The cause of action is for breach of contract that every State recognizes.                But wouldn't it have been the easiest thing for Congress to say, as it does countless times when it creates Federal rights, that Federal courts have jurisdiction to enforce these rights?        And they didn't do that here.           Well, ERISA has a very clear preemption provision too, and that's generated a fair amount of work for us.              Thank you very much, Mr. Stock. Mr. Shelley, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY F. SHELLEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER              I wonder if you could focus on one question for me.                  If you have a State law cause of action and the law to be applied to some aspects of that cause of action is Federal law, is that sufficient to establish Federal question jurisdiction or not?           Counsel --           -- the -- the Grable case said, though, that the Federal question had to be a necessary element of the State law cause of action. That's not always the case in these cases, is it?                It's only -- the -- the Federal question comes up only on issues of preemption.              They may or may not be presented in a particular case.                Well, that kind of -- that begs the -- that's not the question I asked and it sort of begs the question.                  I mean, you have the State law cause of action to enforce your contract claim, and if there's some State law that's asserted against you that's inconsistent with the contract, then you have the Federal question issue.                  But that's the only Federal question I see in the case.               My hypothetical that I started with was assuming you have a State law claim, a State law cause of action.                   So do you have any authority other than Grable for the proposition that a State law cause of action which -- in which the law to apply may or may not turn on Federal law in particular aspects presents a Federal question?
05-204 +++$+++              We'll hear argument next in No. 05-204, League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Smith. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 05-276             So your -- your statement that it was for one reason only means it wasn't for any discriminatory reason on the grounds of race or ethnicity?            Which -- which motivation?           How -- how does that make any sense to say that what you're objecting to is the consideration of race in one situation, but if it's compact and the predominant motive was the consideration of race, that doesn't bother you?                That seems to me to be a back-door way to get into a more extensive judicial review of the compactness and based on racial considerations that are, under your view, the predominant factor in each case.           So you can take race into account if it's compact as a predominant motive. You can't take race into account if it's not compact.           As a dominant motive.           Well, isn't it correct, though, that a result is -- focus on results is not sufficient if the challenge is an equal protection one and not a section 2 one?           I'm talking about district 25.               Well, that's why I asked earlier that your -- your statement that all of this was done with a political motive -- I wondered how that satisfied the equal protection requirement, not the section 2 requirement.           Well, counsel, just take it in -- in an abstract way.                 If you think that the prior system has been gerrymandered by the party in power, are you saying that when that shift in power in the statewide offices changes, that the new party in power cannot redress the gerrymandering of its predecessor?               Let me give you another parallel.             Let's suppose that districts have been gerrymandered for racially discriminatory purposes for years.             Can you take race into account in drawing new districts to remedy that racial discrimination?              Well, there was no --              Is that the reason these lines were not redrawn at the beginning of the decade, because the majority party sat on its hands?              I thought --           What was the percentage of the African American voters in the district as a whole?           So that if you had a situation where it's 40 percent one group, 40 percent another group, and 20 percent where the 20 percent controlled who was elected by siding with one group or the other group, then you would say that that was an influence district for that small -- the smallest group in the district?             Thank you, Mr. Smith. Ms. Perales. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NINA PERALES ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 05-439               Does that undermine the assumption that there's -- they're voting as a bloc?       30 percent of the group is voting for one candidate.             Is that sufficient to establish a voting bloc?           Can I -- can I -- I don't understand -- I think your argument is at cross purposes.         I mean, the one point -- and you're making the point that the Democrats do not vote overwhelmingly for the Democratic candidate.               They voted as much as 30 percent for Bonilla.          But the Voting Rights Act is concerned with whether or not a group voting ethnically as a bloc can vote for candidates of its choice.                    Well, if they're 30/70, it's not -- it's hard to think of them as having a clear candidate of choice.                   So what does it matter whether they're in or out?           Yes, the percentage goes up, the percentage goes down.           It depends on who's running against him.          At the low point, there was a popular Hispanic candidate running against him in some of those elections. But it seems to me that the predicate for coverage under the Voting Rights Act that a particular group is being denied the opportunity to elect a candidate of its choice doesn't even come into play if you're right that the -- the vote is split over time, depending on the circumstances in a particular election.           Well, then -- well, but then -- and this is why I say it's an argument at cross purposes.        If you're right about that, then the assumption that the Hispanic voters are going to be voting Democratic is not one that was unfounded, which I thought was your -- your first point.           It's not just the State that's saying it, though.                You have a district court finding that ethnicity was not the predominant factor, that politics was the predominant factor. Maybe -- as Justice Scalia suggests, maybe they were right, maybe they were wrong, but the point was that it was being done for political purposes not for ethnic purposes.           Is that -- and what relevance does that have?             What provision of the Constitution prevents you from leaving a majority of one group in a district to create the impression that the district supports a particular candidate?           That's what the Fourteenth Amendment was passed for, to avoid creating the impression that a particular group supports a particular candidate?           And how many -- what percentage would they have shifted from making it look like a Hispanic opportunity district with about 51 percent to when it would actually be one?                What percentage does it shift from being looking like one to being one, both above a majority?           But what's the number?           Is that your number? It has to -- anything short of 63, it's just looking like it?         I mean, really, you're asking us to draw a very fine line between a -- in each case a majority Hispanic voting age district, but in one case, it's a constitutional violation and in the other case, it's -- it's required by the Voting Rights Act.                So what is the magic number between 51 and 63?           What's the number?           So if this district were drawn with 60 percent, you would say that's just to make it look like a Hispanic district?           No.   So what's the number?        It's -- it's somewhat more than 51 percent because you're saying that's a constitutional violation, and I want to know how many more it takes before it becomes what's required under the Voting Rights Act.            I'm just trying to get a number.          If you're asking us to rule on a constitutional violation, I'm asking to find out what the number is that changes it from a political nuance to a Hispanic opportunity.           Would it have been better --           -- would it have been better in your view if they had excluded more Hispanics so it didn't look like a Hispanic opportunity district?           And -- and that would have been preferable.           It would have been preferable to you if it was, say, 45 percent Hispanic rather than 50.8, or whatever it was.

Is it a possible distinction of that case that that involved a contingent fee arrangement, and in other words, the lawyer's labors generated the -- the asset, while in this case, the claim depends upon the -- the contractual provision?            Well, you may not -- you may not rely on the distinction, but I would have thought your answer might have been that the lawyer had an equitable claim apart from the contractual provisions so that when you enforce the contractual provisions, Justice Holmes would have thought of it in equitable terms, while here, there's no equitable claim apart from the particular provisions of the contract.               But why is that?     I mean, we spend a lot of time with these old English cases.       Why -- why did Congress -- it seems an arbitrary line.              Thank you, Mr. Feldman.

05-381 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument first in case 05-381 Weyerhaeuser Company versus Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Company. Mr. Pincus. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Well, it's a little different here in that in the Brooke Group cases, of course, the alleged anticompetitive conduct was pricing too low, which has at least a direct benefit to consumers either in the short term, certainly in the short term, and arguably in the long-term as well, while here that is not the form in which the anticompetitive conduct, that's not the form the anticompetitive conduct takes.   So isn't that a reason not to think that we should apply the Brooke Group test to this situation?                    Have we ever identified that as a benefit that the antitrust laws try to achieve, people get higher prices for what they sell?                    So in Brooke Group, we said it's a benefit when prices are low to consumers, and in this other case we said it's a benefit when prices are high to suppliers.                  Thank you, Mr. Pincus. Mr. Shanmugam. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER                  Would you describe the hypothetical Justice Stevens posed to your, your brother, would you describe that as just aggressive bidding?   Aggressive is, you know, it's kind of a good term when you're talking about competition.                     But what if it's purposely bidding higher than you know your rival can afford?                    Thank you, Mr. Haglund. Mr. Pincus, you have two minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                  You can finish your sentence.

Maybe this is not a fair -- how likely is it, given our determination in Dabit about how Congress intended to treat fraud claims, that negligence claims are going to fare any better?              Thank you, Mr. Perry. Mr. Frederick, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

PERKELL ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS          I'm sorry, Ms. Perkell, could I ask you to speak up just a bit?          Thanks.             I suppose --             I suppose there can always be a specific objection to the reasonable availability of a particular remedy.                     I mean, if this -- the prison remedy is, you know, within 5 minutes you've got to file a complaint or something.                    But that's not the question here.           The question here is what the PLRA requires, as a general matter, with respect to prison remedies.           Ms. --           -- Perkell, perhaps you'd like to save your remaining --           -- time for rebuttal.           Thank you. Mr. Himmelfarb, we'll hear now from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS             Thank you, Mr. Feder. Ms. Perkell, you may have a minute for rebuttal.

PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            Well, unless somebody raises it.          Unless somebody raises it below to preserve it for the rehearing en banc or -- or some other way.           So -- so that if you charged --           So that if you charged the workers, you know, $10 for their fake ID cards, you think that would be a different case.           Because there, that's -- there, you -- you -- there's a separate enterprise basically selling ID cards, and that's not part of Mohawk's business.            But if you're just hiring them the way you hire other employees, illegally as it's alleged, that's Mohawk's enterprise if there's some separate illegal activity?              Thank you, counsel. Mr. Phillips, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

JOHNSON ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                   Well --                   Well, that's what they were told, right?    They're instructed that the mitigating circumstances, including factor (k), are merely examples, right?                This Court, in Payton, said that it was not unreasonable to conclude that evidence of remorse extenuated the gravity of the crime. So, why wouldn't an instruction to the jury along the lines of Justice Stevens's hypothetical have been perfectly constitutional as extenuate the gravity of the crime that's interpreted in Brown versus Payton?                  The prosecutor didn't object to any of this mitigating -- mitigation evidence that was submitted by the defendant, did he?                 Thank you, counsel. Mr. Johnson, you have 6 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. JOHNSON ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
05-502 +++$+++                 We'll hear argument first today in Brigham City, Utah v. Stuart. Mr. Gray. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. GRAY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER              How much -- you've been focusing on the violence because of the punch being thrown, but I gather they were called originally because of concern about the noise and disturbance of the peace and all that.              Is that a sufficient basis for them to have gone into the backyard and proceed from there?              They're just shouting.         There are five people in the house shouting. It's 3:00 in the morning or whatever.                     Is that -- is that enough?              Doesn't yelling so loudly you can't hear police knock at the door at 3:00 in the morning suggest that violence is at least imminent or may well be associated with what they're hearing?              Any kind of assault. I gather it's an assault if you're just sort of a couple of guys pushing each other back and forth.                Thank you, counsel. General MCNulty. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. MCNULTY ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER                So if there were no punch in this case, would they have had a sufficient basis?       3:00 in the morning, loud shouting.                Can they conclude, based on their experience, that's likely to escalate into violence and enter on that basis?              Well, counsel, let's suppose you have a police officer who knows there's evidence in this house, but he doesn't have probable cause to get a warrant.           And he also knows that the family is going to be reenacting the murder scene from some movie as part of the family reunion.                 And so he's there just at the time where the -- in the scene the one guy says, and now I'm going to kill you with this knife, and he says, ah, and he goes in. Now, subjectively we know that he has no basis for fearing violence, but a reasonable officer on the scene, hearing somebody say I'm going to kill you with this knife, would have a basis for entering. So under your test, is that entry permissible or not?           Really.           So he knows that there's no -- well, but that's the difference here between looking at the subjective motivation or what an objective, you know, officer would understand.           Right.              Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gray, you have 6 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. GRAY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER              Counsel, you have -- you have two questions presented.                   The second is whether this was sufficiently -- sufficiently exigent to fall under the exigent circumstances.                  But the first was whether the test should turn on the officer's subjective motivation.              I haven't heard much about that this morning.               How is that presented on these facts?
05-5224 +++$+++               We'll hear argument first today in Davis v. Washington. Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            Well, what about -- what if you -- what if somebody runs out of the -- the house?       There are two people standing in the yard, a law enforcement officer and the next-door neighbor. She yells at the next-door neighbor, he's trying to kill me, and then he comes out.                Is that covered by your rule?          It's not to a law enforcement officer. It's to the next-door neighbor, but the law enforcement officer overhears it.              Well, I thought that was -- I thought that was to determine if there were outstanding orders and warrants against the individual.              But that's related -- that's related to sending people to prevent crime as opposed to gathering evidence to be used to convict.              Well, they're not sending someone -- they're not sending someone to apprehend Mr. Davis.            They're sending someone to prevent him from attacking his wife.            Well, that's not -- that's not true at all.            I mean, if -- if the -- the witness may be a good witness and compelling on the stand, they may have every incentive to bring her in in person.        This is only addressed to the situations where the witness is unwilling or unable to testify.            But Justice Scalia's question raises the -- the point.                 The reason these witnesses are not there is not because of anything that the government has done.              It's -- it's the concern they have, the particular domestic abuse situation.                    It's not the government that is keeping these witnesses out. They're not relying on the 911 calls as a matter of preference.              Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Fisher, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
05-547 +++$+++             We'll hear argument first this morning in Lopez versus Gonzales and Toledo-Flores versus United States. Mr. Long. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR. ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER LOPEZ             Well, that doesn't carry too much weight, though, because the provision that -- I'm looking at (g)(3), "violates any State law relating to any controlled substance," can be broader than what's punishable under the Federal Controlled Substances --             -- Act.                But has it ever been applied in a -- to a statute that specifically says that the term "aggravated felony" applies to an offense described in this paragraph, whether in violation of Federal or State law?                That would seem to me to be a very express legislative repudiation of the Jerome --                -- principle.               Thank you, Mr. Long. Mr. Crooks, we'll hear now from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY CROOKS ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER TOLEDO-FLORES             But there's no supervised release of people outside the United States.             Well, like what?             What's going to happen to him if he does that?             Has anything like that ever happened before with people subject to supervised release who are then deported?         It would be the first time, if the District Court did that, right?             Well, no, because --             -- in that -- in that instance, action can be taken against him if he does further violate the law under the terms of probation.          The point is that the jurisdiction of the probation office or the District Court doesn't extend to Mexico.                Well --                -- you don't want to say that your case is not moot because your client is going to violate the law again in the future.               Thank you, Counsel.             Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Long, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.

05-593 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument first this morning in Osborn v. Haley. Mr. Grant. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC GRANT ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                    But the actual statutory language refers to acting within the scope of employment at the time of the incident, and so a certification based on the view that at the time of the alleged incident, he was acting entirely within his scope would seem to be within the language of the statute.                Well how is it -- I mean, that line is awfully difficult to draw.                You assert he didn't do it versus something else.               But it's easy, let's say it's an assault case and the person says, you hit me, and the person says, well, it was entirely an accident; I was gesticulating with my hand so it wasn't, wouldn't have met the requirements for the tort.                Now, are they denying the incident in that case?                But it's not just a characterization.    If it's something that has, for example, a mental element, the plaintiff can assert, you did that with malice aforethought and the defendant can say, no, I didn't.    Now, is that a characterization or is that a denial of the incident?                  It's not for deciding whether removal -- I thought the statute says that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive with respect to removal.                  Well, what does it mean to say that the certification is conclusive with respect to scope of employment for purposes of removal if it doesn't mean that it's conclusive, if you're going to have judicial review that is going to address the question of removal as opposed to the validity of the certification on the merits?                   So you're saying it's only conclusive if it's right?                There is at least considerable tension with 1447(d), though, and 2679(d)(2), in that that specifically says that for purposes of removal, the Attorney General's certification is conclusive.   And it doesn't, if you look at 2679, it suggests, you'd think that case would proceed in Federal court rather than be immediately remanded without the availability of review.                 This is a different type of jurisdictional statute in that there is concern on Congress's part here to provide a Federal forum for the adjudication of whether something is within the scope of a Federal employee's duty.              It's not inconceivable, but it would seem illogical to specifically provide for review of that determination but then have that review take place in State court rather than Federal court.                 Thank you, counsel. Mr. Grant, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC GRANT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 Well, there was nothing expressed about Thermtron, and yet we recognized an exception there.

CHANOS ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                   I take it from your presentation you think we do have to go through the Teague analysis.    We can't just rely on 2254(d)(1)?                   Well then, what do you do about 2254(e)(1), or I guess (e)(2), which seems to suggest at different rule if a case is made retroactive?                    Now, my point was that looking at (d)(1), it says is the decision contrary to established law.     And I would have thought that if it's a new decision it's clearly not contrary to established law.                    But on the other hand, you look at (e)(2) and it says here's what you do if you're applying a new decision that's that been made retroactive.   So I would have thought that meant you can't say simply because it's a new decision it won't apply.                   Thank you, Ms. Forsman. General Chanos, you have two minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. CHANOS ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                  You can finish your sentence.                  Particularly if it is Justice Harlan you're quoting. (Laughter.)

GOLDBERG ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER           It was excluded with respect to mens rea, but, of course, all of the evidence came in with respect to the insanity defense.           Well --             But --             But the lay -- I'm sorry.       That was my question.            The lay --               -- witnesses still talked about his mental state, correct?           And your evidence to the contrary that was excluded would have showed what?           So, it went to diminished mental capacity.             And as I understand Arizona law, it has decided that that evidence can only be presented in the context of an insanity defense.           Well, but it only --           -- goes uncontested --           -- it only goes uncontested if the only way you're going to contest it is to show diminished capacity.               You could have contested this evidence by showing that, you know, he was a in a rock band, and he wanted to play the music for -- to advertise the concert, not to lure the police.        There are a lot of defenses you can present. What they're saying is, if it goes to diminished capacity, that has to be used to show insanity or not - - or nothing at all.             Thank you, General. Mr. Goldberg, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. GOLDBERG ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER             But that certainly doesn't include the right to present any evidence you want.

05-608 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument first this morning in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech. Mr. Kester. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. KESTER ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                 Mr. Kester, would it --                 -- would it -- would your position be different if the contract contained a specific -- the license -- a specific provision specifying that the licensee may not sue?                 You -- do you think such a provision would be enforceable?                    Well, let's look at what might be a matter of jurisdictional law.                      I take it, from your position, there's nothing preventing Genentech from suing, either, is there?           In other words, to establish the validity of their patent.                    Against licensees?                Oh, but the patentee would just say, "Look, we have a license.                I think the patent's valid, and you owe me a dollar a unit."                The licensee said, "Well, I don't think they're -- it's valid, so I owe you nothing."        And they settle on a license for 50 cents.    Why can't the patentee say, "You know, if I get a judicial decision establishing that the patent is valid, I can charge a higher license, either when this agreement expires or for other licenses"?                I'm trying to see how far you want -- are willing to push your argument that just because there's been an agreement, or perhaps even a settlement, that that somehow or another doesn't moot the controversy, the underlying legal dispute.               And it -- I gather your answer to me is that Genentech, or a patentee, can sue, even though they have an existing -- they're getting royalties from the licensee, they can still sue the licensee.                 So, there's no way, I -- under your view, that a patent holder can protect itself from suit through any license arrangement or any agreement of any kind.                   -- think --                   -- if you don't think --                  Well, then why are you paying it, if you -- if you don't think you owe it?                  Because of the threat of treble damages --                  -- and injunction.                  If we're trying to figure out where the public policy is here, why don't we give some weight to those congressional enactments that obviously fortify the strength of the patent?                      In other words, Congress passed these provisions providing for treble damages for attorneys' fees.                       And --                  -- and to respond that there's got to be a public policy to counterbalance that, Congress can always do that, if it wants; but it didn't -- it thinks that you need these provisions to protect the patent holders.                   Thank you, Mr. Kester. Ms. Maynard. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                   How do you ever end these things?   Let's say they have this dispute, they bring the litigation, and they settle it.                 They're saying, "Okay, we're going to settle it.                 Instead of paying a license fee of 50 cents, it's going to be 40 cents, and we'll go on."     Then they can sue again, I take it.                  Can they settle that, by the way?     Is it all right to settle it, or is -- that interfere with the policy that patents have to be open to challenge?                  Either one.                  Okay.                Well, I think you overread Pope.    All Pope said was that they're not going to grant specific performance.               In fact, they've said, "Whatever you may think of the policy here, we don't -- specific performance calls on the equitable discretion, and we're not going to do it."               But, I don't read Pope as holding that the clauses are otherwise unenforceable.                   In --                -- other words you're maybe entitled to damages.           And that may be measured by the license fee that you agreed to pay.                  Well, you don't think that matters, though, do you?             I mean, even if they all agree there's no dispute about what the license agreement means, your position is still the same, right?                  There is an Article III controversy because they challenge the validity of the patent?                  Is --                  -- that always the case? I mean, could -- can you enforce a license agreement based on an invalid patent?        You thought it was valid -- parties had a dispute about it -- whether it is valid.                 You entered into agreement, say, "Well, let's split the difference.   We'll -- you know, 50 cents rather than a dollar or nothing."       It's determined that the patent is invalid.   Can the patentee then still say, "Well, you still owe me the money.          We've, kind of, cut -- split the difference.   That was part of the agreement"?                Well, but that -- it's been pointed out that was pursuant to an injunction.

05-6551 +++$+++                  We'll hear argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California.                  Mr. Gold. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER GOLD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER               Counsel, the thing that concerns me about your case is that California's system looks a lot like the Federal system after Booker.            We haven't addressed the issue or had a case involving review of reasonableness for upward departure.            But at least as the circuits have said it, in a federal case, the district judge imposes a maximum, doesn't give any reason for departing from what the guidelines might suggest is a reasonable middle ground, he may be -- I think in most circuits, that would be reversed. Same here.    If a California judge imposes the upper tier but doesn't make any findings, that's going to be reversed.   But if a federal judge gives a statement of his reasons, you know, a vulnerable victim, or an offender likely to offend again, whatever, under most circuit law, that's going to be upheld. Here, if the California judge does that, that's going to be still struck down under your view.                 You talked about Blakely and Apprendi.                 But how does this system look to you under Booker?               Under California, they're advisory anyway.     I mean, even if the judge makes the necessary finding to get up into the higher tier, he doesn't have to impose the higher sentence, he can impose the lower one.               My point is if he makes a finding that justifies going up to the higher term, 16 years in this case, he doesn't have to impose that higher term, he can go back to the middle term.                  So the only part of the California system that creates a problem is this -- the one sentence in the statute that says the judge shall impose the middle term unless he makes a finding.               So that if we rule in your favor, the great benefit for criminal defendants in California will be that judges can now depart without making a particular finding, they can increase the sentence even though they do not find an aggravator within the limits of the California system.               Doesn't the decision in Black suggest the Supreme Court thinks that would be the result?    The California Supreme Court?               I thought that -- it looked to me that's what they were trying to do in Black. I mean, in a way, it is kind of the -- the Black opinion, the day after, if this Court were to agree with you, and the California Supreme Court issued a decision looking a lot like its decision in Black, that would be perfectly valid. In other words, saying that judges can depart within this whole -- just like Booker, they can depart within this whole range, and we're going to review their determinations for reasonableness.                   They don't have to impose the middle sentence, they can impose a higher sentence, and we will review it for reasonableness.                       That would be perfectly all right.                  But what they said was judges can impose a sentence in either of the three -- any one of the three tiers, and we are going to review it for reasonableness.       And if they don't make findings, it is going to be unreasonable, right?               The protection that criminal defendants now have, that they cannot be sentenced to a higher term unless the judge makes particular findings, will then be no longer applicable.               So that now the defendant will have the protection of his jury determining his guilt, will not only have to know the evidence of his guilt of the crime, but also know why he's likely to re-offend in the future, things like he used a firearm, all the bad things that will increase his sentence and might affect how the jury views the issue of guilt in the first place.               And are there a half a dozen jury trials in each -- for each of those various aggravating factors that now have to be tried to the jury?               Thank you, Mr. Laurence. Mr. Gold, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER GOLD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER               Well, Rule 4.410(b) says that the sentencing judge should be guided by the criteria in these rules.                We have to conclude that the California Supreme Court has misread California law to agree with you, don't we?                I mean, I see 1170(b). And I understand your argument, but when I read the California Supreme Court opinion in Black, it says, well, this is what it means.         It doesn't seem to be what it means, but they get to interpret it, don't they?

05-705 +++$+++                 We'll hear argument next in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications.     Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER              In your answer for why they can't, Justice Souter's comment is a classic, this is what administrative agencies do all the time in typical rate regulations.       They make a determination that utility shareholders have to bear this cost.           The rate payers can bear this cost.       And at the end of the day, it is a determination that a rate is reasonable or unreasonable. And it seems to me that that is just what is involved here.   I don't know why their determination about how to allocate who has to collect the rates, and whether they can pass them on or not makes it an impermissible interpretation of what's unjust or unreasonable under 201.              When you say it was always thought of as being triggered by 276, did the FCC reference 201 in issuing its determination that a failure to follow these regulations was unjust and unreasonable?                It doesn't cover certain practices in connection.        It covers all practices in connection.              So you are saying that, putting aside 276, it would clearly be impermissible for the FCC to say one way that long distance carriers provide service to their customers is when those customers use pay phones; and, therefore, we're setting up this rate regime in connection with that service.                 You would say that would be outside the scope of 201(a)?              That's not true.   You can say that this is a way you make a lot of money from your customers that you wouldn't otherwise make, because if there wasn't a pay phone there, they wouldn't be able to use your service.              What about the cell phone example?              But you don't know, the cell phone holder may be right next to the pay phone or he may be across the country.
05-7053 +++$+++                We'll hear argument first this morning in Dixon v. United States. Mr. Jett. ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. CRAIG JETT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER              What do you do with Martin against Ohio?              Well, there may be -- there may be crimes where duress would vitiate an intent element, but there may be other crimes where it wouldn't.         And -- and I don't understand your argument to be -- is it that in every case duress negates an element of the crime or only in some cases?              Well, counsel, under your view, how -- how is the Government supposed to prove a negative in every case?                  How are they supposed to prove the absence of duress?              But that's something that -- but self-defense is something that's often a -- a factual element that you can discern from the circumstances of the crime.                The -- the other guy had a gun, you know, that sort of thing.                    So if it's going to be presented -- so it's something that's within the control of either side. Duress is something that in this case the Government would have no reason to suppose that it was even implicated until it's raised, and then they have no way of getting at what the particulars are because they're all within the control of the defendant.              But I thought the gist of her duress defense was not that she was under duress when she was purchasing the guns, but that she had reason to believe that her children were being threatened by accomplices or associates of -- of this -- this individual.            And there's nothing in the facts of the -- the scene that would lead the Government to have any access to that evidence.              What about a defense that I was on drugs and -- and didn't know what I was doing because of that and couldn't form the requisite intent?        Does the Government have to disprove that as well?              How is the Government -- how would the Government do that?              A person just says, I was -- I was on, you know, PCP or whatever and -- and I couldn't form the requisite intent.              Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. Mr. Jett, you have 4 minutes remaining.

05-7058 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument next in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton. Mr. Andre. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                     Well, we know under the statue they can dismiss a case because it's frivolous, right?                     Regardless of the substance of the claim on the merits, if you know that you've just ignored the exhaustion requirement isn't that a frivolous claim?                  But Rule 8 and the normal rules weren't addressed to the unusual situation under the PLRA where the district court has an affirmative obligation screen on its own before the defendant even gets involved.              So if in fact, just to follow on Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, 80 percent of the cases have this exhaustion problem, why isn't this a reasonable means of facilitating the screening obligation?                  Well, but you just told me earlier that if it was a case in which exhaustion is required and not done that would be a frivolous claim, and the statute does refer to frivolous claims.   So the district court or the Sixth Circuit has just said, we know that in a large number of cases they are going to be frivolous because they have ignored the exhaustion requirement, and we just want to try to find out which those cases are to fulfill the screening obligation, which takes this out of the normal Rule 8 type of case.                   You talk about the lack of statutory direction on the first two points but there is a very explicit statute on the third question. It says no action shall be brought until administrative remedies are exhausted.        And yet you say the action should be allowed to be brought even if there are unexhausted claims in the complaint.                    This is a very different statutory scheme.             This is designed to address the problem of an overwhelming number of frivolous complaints that result in the fact that meritorious complaints can be overlooked.              We've got a haystack in a needle problem here.       And if you allow the action to continue, that doesn't do anything to reduce the number of filing of claims that as you say should not have been brought.                    Well right, but you provide under your approach no incentive for the prisoner to leave those claims out.                      Instead what, a screening function turns into an editing function.                         The district court is supposed to just excise out the unexhausted ones but allow the exhausted ones to continue.                  How many prisoners pay the filing fee in the first place?                  They are not entitled to IFP status?                      Is that a draconian rule, do you think?      You have to have three actions dismissed before you have to pay the filing fee?                   And the other incentive is if you adopt your rule, the incentive on the prisoner is to put in every possible claim, even if it is not exhausted because maybe it will get through, maybe it won't.   And if it doesn't get through, no harm. He doesn't even have to pay another $50.                  Mr. Andre, you have five minute remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE, ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS                  How is that?    The prisoner is the one who presumably knows best whether or not he filed a grievance or not.                    This seems to me to be a stretch to say that the prison, which has how many prisoners under their jurisdiction, is in a better position to know in individual cases, an individual prisoner, what this prisoner did or didn't do with respect to the grievance process.                 Surely the prisoner is in the best position.          He knows what he did or at least what he is going to allege.                      With respect, with respect to the naming of the individuals, is that claim moot because of the change in the policy?                    I thought your main argument before was they invented this requirement without any basis, but now it's an actual requirement in the grievance procedure.                    Future prisoners now do have fair notice because the grievance procedure says name the individuals, dates, names, places, names of all those all involved.

PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER              Mr. Phillips, I may be lost a bit here.   But I mean, which -- I'm looking at the instructions that were given.           And it seems to me it is hard to take issue with the instruction on the railroad's part because it tracks the statutory language.           The statute says in whole or in part, and the instruction says in whole or in part. So if you're pushing the doctrine of equivalence, your objection seems to be to the directly contributed language with respect to the employee, the plaintiff. Now, but doesn't directly contributed, isn't that a typical proximate cause instruction?              Right.   But on the other hand, you're also arguing in favor of proximate cause.                  You are saying Rogers didn't change proximate cause.              So you would have us announce a decision on the doctrine of equivalence without saying which way it should be made equivalent? Raising the railroad's standard or lowering the employee's?             Mr. Phillips, you have two minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

OTT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  We're looking under AEDPA at an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law. What do you do in a situation where you think the state court has incorrectly articulated Supreme Court law, but nonetheless reached the correct result?                     In other words, correct understanding of the established Supreme Court law would have led to the same result as their incorrect articulation of it.                  Right.        My hypothetical, and we'll debate later whether it is this case or not, is let's say that the state court wrongly articulates Supreme Court law.      But under the correct articulation, it leads to the same result.            What happens in that case under AEDPA?                 It misarticulated them.     I guess the question of application is -- I mean, I assumed they reached what we would regard as the correct result under the correct standard, they just articulated the wrong standard. Your answer, I take it, is that it would then be reviewed without AEDPA deference?                You don't need to establish that rule, do you?            You just need to establish that what the Supreme Court determined was not an unreasonable application of this Court's law?                  How different is it from the victim's family sitting in the second row behind the prosecution every day of the trial?                       And I mean, I'm -- the hypothetical correctly focuses on the question, at least for me, of whether or not you can have specific applications of general rules that are clearly established.   I'm just not sure your agreement with it is advisable because it seems to me that simply having -- how many people have to wear these buttons?                       One person shows up with a "Hang Musladin" button, does that mean it is a mob-dominated trial?                  All right.               Thank you, Mr. Ott.

DONAHUE ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS                  That's a disputed point, I gather, central to the case, whether or not the regulations measured PSD emissions through that device rather than the hourly emissions.                  That's an audacious statement. (Laughter.)                  If the regulations are ambiguous, then the agency can interpret them in different ways and can change its interpretation over time.    Of course, what your friend argues happened here is that the agency changed its interpretation in the context of an enforcement program.

Now you're saying it's already too late because somebody else challenged it in 1980?                 To be fair to them, that very same argument was more a product of the Fourth Circuit than of Duke.       They had a somewhat different approach before the Fourth Circuit                 and then the Fourth Circuit came up with this insistence on the parallel construction.

But stare decisis on the basis of statute is kind of a weak basis when the statute's been changed.                  But that's purely -- pure question begging.        I mean, the whole issue on the merits is whether it's a foreign sovereign or not.                         And you can't assume that you're correct when the remand provision or the provision barring appeal when it's been remanded doesn't care whether you're correct.

In other words, you have got subject matter jurisdiction but the statute contemplates it may -- later -- later you may lose subject matter jurisdiction and you can remand it there. And I suppose that that needs to be interpreted in pari materia with (c) so that the remands would not be subject to review.      It seems to me the same situation here.   You have got allegedly subject matter jurisdiction.    It is later defeated, and it is remanded. Why shouldn't that be covered by (c)?                    But you don't have any doubt that a remand under 1447(e) would be covered by 1447(d), do you?                  Thank you, Mr. Simon. Mr. Frederick, you have three minutes remaining.

Of course, you don't know when -- at this proceeding, we have no idea, if we rule in your favor, what alternative the State is going to provide, and I am willing to bet whatever that alternative is that it will be subject to a challenge under a new 1983 suit. There would be no claim preclusion if you didn't know what the alternative was at this point.           Right?                Would it be -- if -- if in the future, if States specify the method of execution in the sentence, then you would not have a 1983 action.             Is that correct?        Because you would then be challenging the sentence, and it would have to be brought under habeas.               Well, you -- you alleged in your complaint -- I'm looking at footnote 3 -- that you assumed they were going to follow the same protocol as in Sims.              Do you think there was adequate time for the district court to fully consider the evidence you intended to present and consider your claim and still proceed with the execution that was scheduled?              You filed your case 4 days before the execution.              The Sims protocol was there as a matter of public domain.

For example, if the application for state post-conviction relief raised arguments under state law, those would not be a proper subject of a petition for certiorari.                  Of course, the other way to read the language is that the state application is final -- otherwise you couldn't file the Federal petition for certiorari, and that petition may affect what happens with your application for state relief, but the state application itself is final and over.                      Well, it has to be final before you can file a petition for cert.                      So what about the argument raised by your friend that exhaustion doesn't require filing a petition for certiorari, that the state procedures are considered fully exhausted upon the final decision in the state court and that it makes sense to treat this, this 2244, in a parallel way with respect to the exhaustion requirement?                   How do you know what is pending with respect to when the state defendant, movant, doesn't file a petition for certiorari?                  Is that --                   Is the state post-conviction application still pending on the 90th day?                   Well, anybody who wants the additional time -- this law was passed to prevent people from delaying.            But anybody who wanted to delay would then have to file a cert petition, I assume?                   But if you filed -- so you say you get 90 days whether you file or not?                   But if you want the additional time that it takes for an opposition, for waiver of response, for this court to dispose of it, then you have to file a petition for cert?                  Right.                   You know, what about 2244(D)(1)(a) where Congress referred expressly to the time for seeking direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review?             Your reading of D(2) is that that's what they meant when they said the state application was pending.         The state application or the time for seeking review of the state application, and in -- just in just a few sections above that they expressly said that shouldn't we read pending in a different, different direction?                    Well, they would have just said during the time of the application for state post-conviction, or the expiration of the time for seeking review of it.                     But in what sense is it an application for state post-conviction review when it's pending before us?          We are considering a claim that the state erroneously decided a Federal question --                     -- but it's not an application, it's an application for our review, not state post-conviction review.                    Do you have any, I suppose this, we ought to know better, but how long the average disposition time is for a petition for certiorari in a case like this?                    No.   From the time of, I suppose the pertinent question would be from the time of final state, final state judgment, eventual filing for petition for cert, opposition, waiver, our disposition?   Presumably, probably five or six months?                    Well, why don't you take, let's just if say you take 90 days, and you get --                    And you get a two month extension.                    Then you get another month for the opposition depending on what circuit you're from for the extension.              Get another month for the opposition, at least two months, month and a half, for us to dispose of it.         It probably comes out to about six months.                   Now I guess -- my question is, in a law that imposed a one-year statute of limitation, is this an implicit additional, I realize it's a question begging to some extent, but implicitly an additional six-month period would strike me as odd.                   Well, the reason that's tolled is because it's designed to encourage the exhaustion of the state procedures.                     This additional period is when it's pending, not before the state but before a Federal court.                    Any -- any statistics on how many petitions for cert from state post-conviction collateral review are granted?                  In other words, if we are talking about an additional six months in every case, how many of those are actually granted?                  No, but if the state is petitioning for cert it means you've won.                  So presumably you're not looking forward to further --                  Assuming you make the same argument you make on questions 2 and 3 about the availability of equitable tolling.                  I would be very surprised if the court found you were out of time because the state had filed a petition for certiorari.                  And have it granted.                   Thank you, Mr. Kise. Ms. Bonner, you have four minutes remaining. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY C. BONNER ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                  Records don't have to -- typically are not filed with the petition for cert.   So the record would be back in the lower court.                  Just to be clear, it is your position that to get -- you think everyone's entitled to the additional 90 days whether they file or not.                  To get the additional time for an opposition that would be considered here, you have to file the petition for cert. In other words, if you don't file after the 90th day it's no longer pending.                  Okay.   So then why wouldn't the result of your position be that every person who is denied state post-conviction relief is going to file a cert position to get the additional time?                  Wouldn't that lead to that result?   If Congress was concerned that people were stringing out the time before they seek habeas, one way to string it out under your reading, but not under the state's reading, would be to file a petition for cert.                  I'm sorry.   What's the trigger?                  Yes.   When they wanted to include the 90 days, they said the expiration of the time for seeking review.              They did not say that in (d)(2).                  I mean, if the defendant had no incentive to delay, why did Congress think it necessary to impose the statue of limitations? They did that because they thought people were stringing out their -- and they were applying for Federal habeas after too long of a delay.                   Thank you, Miss Bonner.
05-908 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument first today in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number 1. Mr. Korrell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY J.F. KORRELL ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                    But the lawsuit was originally brought by a corporate entity, correct?                    Not by individual parents.                  Thank you, counsel. General Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER                      Counsel, if I could get back to Justice Kennedy's question earlier, how do you distinguish decisions like citing magnet schools, clustering, from the consideration of race in this case?                    You can answer in this case, General. (Laughter.)                      General?                  Thank you, Mr. Madden. Mr. Korrell, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY J.F. KORRELL ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
05-9222 +++$+++                     We will hear argument next in Burton versus Stewart. Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  I'm not sure I understand that.   I mean, we have not held, for example, that the fact of a prior conviction is something that has to be submitted to a jury under Blakely.               Why, if you're determining that sentences run consecutively, isn't that just the same as looking at a simultaneous conviction and saying they're going to run consecutively?                  So you'd have --                 And you're saying that that extra finding can't simply be that this is a conviction for a particular serious crime that's going to go unpunished otherwise?                 So under this system if you had a regime where if you're convicted of murder and you've been convicted of rape before that, you get an enhanced sentence beyond the normal murder sentence, that would not contravene Blakely.              But if you're convicted at the same time for rape and murder and those two sentences run consecutively, you say that that does violate Blakely.                 So you think Blakely was not a new rule but Booker was?                This argument, this argument assumes that we rule against you on whether or not it is a new rule.                Don't you have -- don't you have to address AEDPA before we get to that question?                In other words, it doesn't matter it it's a watershed, I guess it is a point of argument, but it is not clear that it matters whether it is a watershed rule if you read AEDPA 2254(d)(1) by its terms.                 Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
05-9264 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument first this morning in James versus United States. Mr. Crawford? ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG L. CRAWFORD, ESQ. ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    But in Florida, that would be burglary itself, right, because it covers the curtilage around the house?                 Right.   And we don't even have to ask whether that presents a serious potential risk under the statute, right?                Because, if burglary is identified as -- a predicate offense without the need to resort to the definition?                 Specifically deleted or didn't --                 That's quite different than specifically deleting it.              In other words, it was never there in the proposal.                 So, do I understand your submission to be that putting a ladder against the side of a house to attempt burglary, starting up the ladder, that that generically does not pose a potential risk of physical injury?                 We understand from your friend on the other side that an overt act toward fulfilling the attempt is required under Florida law. In other words, it's not just enough to have burglary tools in your house.                 You've got to take an affirmative step toward accomplishing the burglary.                    Do you think that, is conspiracy to commit burglary a crime that poses a serious potential risk as burglary does?                    Doesn't that seem like a fine line?     I mean, if you're sitting around with your coconspirator planning it you can be covered under this provision, planning a burglary.                 But if you actually get out there with the burglary tools, you put the ladder against the door and you start up the ladder, that somehow involves less of a potential risk of physical injury?                  You think the Eleventh Circuit is wrong?                    You don't have any doubt that, at least with respect to two of the other named crimes, attempts would present a serious potential risk?   In other words, attempted arson or attempted use of explosives?   You concede those would be covered, don't you?                  Mr. Crawford, you have four minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG L. CRAWFORD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  It's different when you're dealing with an escapee or someone who has visitation right and then doesn't report back and qualifies as a escaped felon from prison.                That's quite a bit different from an arrest in a normal situation.                No.   There's a greater -- I had this case in the D.C. Circuit.                There's a greater degree of potential when you're dealing with someone who's escaped from prison than with someone else who's being arrested.       Of course there's always the potential, but the judgment was that there's a greater degree of potential when you're trying to apprehend someone who's escaped.
05-983 +++$+++                     We'll hear argument this morning in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District.    Mr. Andre. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   Well, you say they're the co-architects.         I mean, are you saying anything more than they are given the procedural right to participate in the hearing?                   Isn't there a bit of -- there's a leap from saying they have these various procedural rights and they're are a party aggrieved by the decision rendered after the hearing, that's a different question, isn't it?                   Which just begs the question, doesn't it?     I mean, you're assuming that the parents are a party to the case in Federal court.                   I thought it was the unanimous view of the circuits that parents, as a general matter, do not have the right to represent their children in Federal court, that the provision of the judicial code that you cited does not confer on parents, generally, the right to represent children.                    The statute already allows the shifting of fees to a prevailing party.                   So presumably attorneys can be found to take the meritorious cases.      And What we are probably dealing with are cases that can't attract attorneys, even though the attorneys know that if they win, they will get their fees.                  Well, if they had that overriding intent, it would have been easy enough for them to make clear that this was an exception to the normal rule, that parents don't have the right to represent children in court.            They did that with respect to the administrative proceeding, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out.   They perhaps conspicuously did not do it with respect to the proceeding in court.                   I know, but 14 -- is it 1415(f)?     Specifically says that parents have the right to participate in the due process hearing.                   I'm looking at 1415(f)(1)(A).            In other words, parents have the right to participate in the due process hearing.                   It doesn't say they have the right to participate as parties.                   They have -- it says they have the right to -- for an impartial due process hearing.    I would suppose if you're trying to figure out who is the party to that case, you would still think of it in terms of the child and not the parents.                   Thank you, Mr. Andre. Mr. Salmons. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS                      That argument proves a little too much.      If you have a child who is the victim of a tort, for example, and suffers a serious injury, it is the parents who are going to have to bear the costs of accommodating that injury.                   And yet in any tort action, it's still the child who is the party and not the parent.                  So their, their rights -- so their right to proceed in Federal court should be limited to the rights that you've identified under the statute as opposed to the right to proceed on behalf of the child?                  In other words, you think -- you think their -- their, their rights -- the rights they can assert are only ones they can identify as their own as opposed to the child's?                   It is not -- it is not just party aggrieved.            It's party aggrieved by the findings and decision, as opposed to party aggrieved by a denial of the procedural right, and those strike me as two different things.                      Thank you, Mr. Bergeron. Mr. Andre, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE, ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS                    So why didn't Congress just add the provision making this very clear that the Senate had passed, why did the House boot it out of the conference bill?                   Why do you think it's totally inapplicable?                   Please --                   So you think it is not violated, not that it doesn't apply for some reason? There is no doubt this is spending clause legislation, right?
05-996 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument first today in Marrama versus Citizens Bank of Massachusetts.    Mr. Baker. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID G. BAKER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Mr. Baker, as I understand it subsequent to the grant of certiorari in this case, your client filed for relief under Chapter 13 and that relief was denied.           You're now seeking under -- your petition seeks a conversion to Chapter 13 and I guess I wonder what relief is still open to you.                  What relief is open to you in this case?    In other words, you're trying to get a conversion to Chapter 13.            Subsequently, you've tried to apply for relief under Chapter 13 and that's been denied.   Why isn't the case moot in the sense that that relief is not available to you now?                 When cases are reconverted to Chapter 7, is that typically done before or after the filing of the Chapter 13 plan?                   Creditors -- under Chapter 13 one of the prerequisites to approval of the plan is that the creditors get at least as much as they would have gotten under Chapter 7, right?                   So presumably the creditors might want to see what the Chapter 13 plan looks like themselves.                  Thank you, Mr. Baker.                   We'll hear from Ms. Blatt first.                 Thank you, Ms. Blatt. Now, Mr. Baker. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID G. BAKER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 I'm sorry.   You have two minutes remaining.
05-998 +++$+++                 We'll hear argument first this morning in United States versus Resendiz-Ponce. Mr. Dreeben. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  That doesn't necessarily make sense.       You can imagine a situation where the probable cause and the eventual evidence that supports guilt is adduced after the indictment and the prosecutor says, you know, we're going to find that evidence once we get into it, we don't have it now, but indict anyway without it. In other words, what's your response to the situation where there's no probable cause on an element at the time of the indictment, but that evidence is later adduced and is a sufficient basis to convict?                 Well, it sits to decide whether people should be indicted, and yes, they're supposed to determine whether there's probable cause, but historically a significant role for the grand jury has been not to indict people even though the Government had the evidence to indict them.                Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.                    Mr. Dreeben, you have three minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.    The case is submitted.
06-1005 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument next in case 06-1005, United States versus Santos. Mr. Roberts. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Why don't you continue.    I'm sorry.     I didn't know you weren't done.                   I thought your answer to the line of questioning that we were having was that the problem would still be there, even if you limited this statute to profits.                You take the two bank robbers in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, the one that robs the bank, the other in the get-away car.                If before the robber gave the money to the person in the get-away car, he said, now, you know, I'm keeping $100 because I had to buy the gun and that was $100, so you only get 400, so it's only the profits that they're splitting, you'd have the same problem, wouldn't you?                  Thank you, counsel.                  Thank you, Mr. Vare. Mr. Roberts, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
06-10119 +++$+++                       We'll hear argument next in case 06-10119, Synder v. Louisiana. Mr. Bright. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BRIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    I think that's right that you zero in on the ones as to which you objected. But you also want to rely on the fact that these other jurors were excluded, and no objection was made to their exclusion.   If an objection had been made, the State, of course, would have -- could have explained if they had a reason, a non-racial one, why they were struck.                   But you didn't object. And yet you want them to be considered as convincing racial bias.                   Presumably because no objection was raised as to Mr. Hawkins.                   I mean, it is -- the burden is on you to object if you think jurors are being excluded on a racial basis.                  Out of -- out of how many who were struck.                  Well, I'm looking at -- at the joint appendix on page 360.                   As I read it, Miss Scott gives an answer that can't be heard, right?                   Ms. Dupont says, "I'm sorry, I can't hear you."              I mean, we don't know; since we weren't there if it was kind of, you know, "I think I could" and then "I think" -- I mean, you know, it's an atmospheric determination by the -- the district court judge; and as -- as has been pointed out here, all we have is the cold transcript.                   That's on joint appendix 401?                   And -- and the problem with that, of course, is it's --                   367.                   Well, but -- the question is not could you consider the death penalty. It says could you consider both, when they're going through several of the juries.              Jurors.                   And I thought that was -- the point was made by your friend on the other side, was that it was ambiguous as to what option she was saying she could consider.                   If --                   With Brooks, what he said when he said I'm missing right now something that will better me towards my teaching career, and they say -- and the judge says, is there anybody who could speak to it?   And he says, I've already talked to the dean.   And so based on the initial conversation with the dean he was still worried.                   Then the judge calls the dean, and of course the dean's going to --                   Well, that's what he's going to say to the judge.              When Brooks talked to him, apparently there was a problem because his concern remained after having talked to the dean.                   He says I'm missing right now --                   Something that could help me out towards my teaching career.                   I don't understand your answer that Mr. Brooks did not say there was a problem.   He says, I've already missed half a day. There's something I'm missing right now that will better me towards my teaching career.              He says I've already talked to the dean. How can you say he isn't identifying a problem?                   What about the explanation that was given that this was referring to the defendant's feigning emotional distress rather than anything to do with race?                   What doesn't have anything to do with it?                   So the relief you are requesting goes only to the penalty and not to the conviction?                   Even though -- even though your theory is that it was only with respect to the penalty that the bias -- you have no allegation --                   -- that this jury did not return a valid conviction.                   I thought your objection was with respect to the death penalty.                  Thank you, Mr. Boudreaux. Mr. Bright, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B.

The objection would have afforded the state an opportunity to present the -- if there was one -- the non-racial reason THAT they struck the juror.

HOCHMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  I take it you concede that a breakout as opposed to a failure to report would be covered by the statute?                    Maybe -- I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I thought what Justice Kennedy was asking is what if you have a statute that is just escape or whatever and doesn't break it down like that?   At that point would we look to see what the crime of escape was typically like, most of them were breakout or most of them were the other thing?                        You have, I gather, two separate provisions, but what if you don't?                    I'm sorry.   If that's the case, I'm looking at 720 Illinois Statutes 5/31-6.    It's reproduced a page 2a of the Government's brief.    And they don't -- it doesn't seem to be a separate provision, whether it's a breakout or a failure to report.                    So invading someone's space, so trespass would be covered by this statute?   You're invading someone's space.                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hochman, you have 11 minutes remaining.

06-11429 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-11429, Burgess versus United States. Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                      Well, but if the rule of lenity depends upon of course some ambiguity in the term, the definition says "'felony drug offense' means an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year."      It doesn't say anything about State classification.                   Well, obviously one is a definition of "felony" and the other is the definition of "felony drug offense" and the term that's at issue here is "felony drug offense."                   Just on that -- just on that last one, are you saying that if it doesn't say "debtor's residential structure," you'd think it was somebody else's residential structure?                   I don't understand the point.                  Well, in a provision of the Bankruptcy Code that deals with debtors I don't think there's any question about whose residential structure they would be talking about, even though they don't repeat "debtor."        It strikes me as quite different than the provision we have before us today.                   If it's such a vexing problem, why would Congress have incorporated the problem into the definition of "felony drug offense"?                   Well, you seem to suggest that it's a vexing problem that "felony" is defined differently in different States.                   And, yet, you say that the term "felony," which relies on how it's defined by different States, was incorporated in the felony drug offense, which seems to have a quite clear definition of punishable by more than one year. If they don't want to repeat the problem that "felony" is defined differently in different States, they would not do what you're suggesting, which is incorporate it wholesale into the latter definition.                    Thank you, Ms. Saharsky. Mr. Fisher, you have four minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
06-11543 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument next in Case 06-11543, Begay v. United States. Ms. Katze. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARGARET A. KATZE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                      You are assuming, of course, that the canon of ejusdem generis applies to the statute, as opposed to Congress just singling out a couple of things it wanted to be sure were covered.                      And we left that issue open in James, didn't we?                  No, but then I was wondering about that as well, that as a violent felony whether that gives you any traction.                     But extortion, you don't normally think of that as a violent felony and yet it's clearly included in the definition.                  Yes, but you don't say, give me that or I'll break your legs all the time. You may say, give me that or I'll release this embarrassing letter.       That's extortion.                It's not violent, though.                   But then, releasing the letter is not violent and it may cause embarrassment rather than physical injury.             Yet it would qualify as extortion.                    It's kind of odd, when the catch-all is phrased in terms of physical injury to another, to say that it's concerned only with property crimes.                   Well, doesn't that suggest that "otherwise" in the statute is in fact used to mean "likewise"?       I mean, if we said "attempted burglary" in James it's obviously included because burglary is -- attempted burglary doesn't present a risk in a different fashion from burglary.                     It presents it in the same fashion.                   That was a helpful question. (Laughter.)                   Well, particularly when you look at subsection (i) in the broad reading of serious potential risk of (ii), why would -- why would Congress mean to exclude a particular category of physical injury from the reach of the statute?                   No, not everything; everything that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.                   What do you think presents the most serious potential risk of injury to all of us, that we are going to be a victim of arson or that we are likely to get hit by a drunk driver?                    Thank you, Counsel.                   Thank you, Ms. Kruger. Ms. Katze, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARGARET A. KATZE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                      Extortion doesn't involve property as an element.                      Something of value -- something of value could be, you know, a confession in a related case or something.                It doesn't necessarily have to be property.                  I don't understand that.    Yes.    Life, liberty, and property include more than property, but --                  What about --                  Well, we know that attempted burglary is covered, and you don't have to enter the house in an attempted burglary.                  Yes.   Well, you are saying this is an analogous crime to the four that are listed, or it is not an analogous crime to the four that are listed?
06-116 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho. Mr. Waxman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  There's no sense in which it's redundant, though.              It would have been the first piece of paper that this Court would have seen in the matter.                   I have a more basic question, whether we had a case or controversy to start with.    This is kind of an intramural dispute between two Guamanian officials about what Guam's position should be with respect to the Organic Act and I'm wondering why that's a justiciable controversy under Article III.                  The cases you cited in your petition all involved on its -- only facially intra -- interbranch disputes within the Federal Government; but the agencies in those cases always -- were representing a real party in interest. United States versus ICC, the ICC was actually the railroad in whose favor the had commission ruled.                    Why shouldn't we just let Guam figure out its position on its own and then when a private party with standing challenges something then we'll have a case or controversy.                    Oh, no.   Guam -- presumably, some state courts issue advisory opinions. We don't -- that's their business.                   It's just a question of whether we have jurisdiction to address the question in that context.                   Now Mr. Waxman, we've taken a fair amount of your time before you got to the merits.     So we'll give you a couple of minutes for rebuttal.     Why don't you answer that.

06-11612 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-11612, Gonzalez v. United States. Mr. Newton. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRENT E. NEWTON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   This may not be a pertinent question, but where does the right to voir dire come from in the first place?                   So it's derivative from other rights?      In other words, it helps implement the right to a fair trial, in the Batson context helps guard against an equal protection violation, but it's not on its own a free-standing right.                    In practice, it's more a tactical decision than a theoretical one.                    I mean you can explain to your client the difference between Article III and a magistrate, but he's going to be more interested in your judgment about, oh, judge so and so doesn't let you get away with anything on voir dire, you know, he runs a tight ship.           This magistrate will let me raise all sorts of other things.              I mean, it's like an objection at trial, in other words.                    It's going to be a tactical decision rather than a theoretical constitutional one.                    Well, if you get to that point, which case of ours holds that the right to a jury trial is a personal right that the defendant must waive rather than waive through counsel?                   But that can be expressed through counsel.            I mean, does -- you know, does your client consent to this?                  Yes. I mean it's quite a different question to say that he has to be the one who stands up in court and says it.                   But, of course, that was for the whole trial.           This is for a very discrete aspect prior to trial.                  Was there a right to voir dire at common law?          I have the impression the judge would send somebody out and, you know, grab the first 12 people they could find.                  Thank you, Ms. Blatt. Mr. Newton, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRENT E. NEWTON, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   You can finish your sentence.
06-1164 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-1164, John R. Sand & Gravel Company v. the United States. Mr. Haynes. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY K. HAYNES ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  Are you asking us to, or you think we have to, to rule in your favor overrule our decisions in Kendall and Soriano?                  Of course, Irwin involved Title 7 and not this 2501.                      And we hadn't addressed Title 7 before, but we have addressed 2501 before.                     Well, in, in the more recent case of Kontrick -- I'm looking at footnote 8 of that opinion -- it used 2401 as an example of the jurisdictional bar and 2401 has pretty much the same language as 2501.                     Well, just, just to get all the cases out on the table, our more recent decision in Bowles suggested that there may be a difference between statutory and rule limitations and also suggested that the prior history of the interpretation of a provision was highly relevant.                   It's a pretty risky business, though, to rely on a dissent in determining whether a majority overruled the prior precedent or not, isn't it?                   Irwin.   I thought that was the one Justice Ginsburg posed to you --                   -- where Justice White in dissent said that Irwin overruled Soriano.                     But the majority certainly didn't say that.                   But it hasn't recodified 2501 in the past 17 years, has it?                   So you think we do have to overrule Kendall and Soriano?                   Or at least say that we already did in Irwin?                    Well, that's exactly what I think we said in -- in Arbaugh; and that, certainly, going forward from that point on, Congress has more or less specified that it's jurisdictional, or we're not going to read it that way.                     But I'm not sure that was the rule in Irwin and I'm pretty sure it wasn't the rule in Soriano and Kendall.                  No, I know, but it seems to me you're arguing that if Kendall came up today, it would be decided differently, and maybe that's right. But the point is it came up 100 years ago and it was decided, and the question is whether we should overturn that decision.                  Well, I think your argument is more strongly supported by Irwin than Franconia.     Franconia simply involved an accrual rule, which doesn't go to what the jurisdictional effect of the bar on commencing a case is. The government there was overreaching and arguing for a special accrual rule, and the Court said no.   That's different than saying whether the actual time for commencing litigation is jurisdictional or not.                  Well, but that's like saying in every diversity case, theoretically, the court has to scrutinize whether someone who alleges they are a citizen of Pennsylvania really is.                     And that's just not the way it really happens.                     The question usually, if not raised by the party, comes up under some other situation, such as in this case the amicus raised it.                  Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Haynes, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY K. HAYNES ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
06-1181 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument next in case 06-1181, Dada v.              Mukasey. Mr. Meade. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   How many of those are -- are granted?                   What percentage of motions to reopen are granted in favor of the alien?                   So how many -- do you know how many are filed on an annual basis?                   So there would be no reason not to file one of these if you were subject to voluntary -- if you elected voluntary departure, and it extended your time to stay, right?                Seemingly, everybody would file one of these if we rule in your favor.                  We're dealing with people who have already broken the law.                 So you're saying they are likely to follow the statute that says only file a motion to reopen under these circumstances?                   Counsel, another way to reconcile the two that I think would be beneficial to your client, but I'm not sure it's open to us, is to address the Government's view that, when you voluntarily depart, your motion to reopen is automatically withdrawn.   That is, as I gather, set forth only in a regulation and not the statute. Now, it seems to me that if I were -- if I thought it important to reconcile the two, I would be much more concerned about that interpretation -- that the motion to reopen is automatically withdrawn -- than I would suggest we start incorporating equitable tolling rules and all of that. But, I take it, the vulnerability of that regulation is probably beyond -- beyond debate.                    So if we don't address it here, there's going to be another case in a year or 18 months where that's going to be raised?                      Well, in all these cases, if you think you have a good case on the motion to reopen, all you have to do is give up the benefits that you have availed yourself under voluntary departure, and then the motion to reopen is not automatically withdrawn.                      No, I mean he -- you should not elect voluntary departure in the first place.                      What were those circumstances here?                    Well, presumably it doesn't take them much time because when someone elects voluntary departure they don't have to address it.                   I mean, this would obviously increase the volume of motions to reopen.      As I said, I don't see know why anybody -- why everybody wouldn't file one, because it extends their stay.                   Well, is your position that the right to appeal is taken away, just as under the current regime the motion to reopen is taken away?                  Do you have to argue that the -- my understanding is that once the -- let's say it's the government's proposed regulation and the motion for -- or the voluntary departure is withdrawn to enable you to consider the motion to reopen.                 They can proceed with deportation at that time, correct?                  So you -- you almost have to be arguing that the motion to reopen tolls the time for deportation as well, right?                  Well, under your position, I guess, is what your position is on that.                   In other words, the government cannot enter a deportation order during a voluntary departure period.                  Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Meade, you have five minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Do you have any estimate about how many more motions to reopen will have to be considered if your client prevails in this case?                    No, I don't understand that, because my -- as I understand it, it would in every case grant an effective extension of the time which you would have to depart if you had filed a motion to reopen.                   You answered my question with respect to the government's proposed regulation.     But under your position that would allow the voluntary departure option to remain open, then anyone who exercised that option would want to file a motion to reopen because it would extend their time?                   The answer is yes?                   Not if it has 10,000 of these a year, as you told me in your opening argument.   I mean, it takes some time to address them. You can't say all they have to do is decide them all within two days.

WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                  I thought that we ruled in the Hamdi case that procedures quite similar to those under the DTA were adequate for American citizens?                  So that --                  So our judgment in this case depends upon whether we agree with you or the government that the procedures available under the DTA are meaningful under Hamdi?                    Your argument wouldn't be any different with respect to the availability of habeas if these people were held for one day, would it?    We don't look at the length of detention in deciding whether habeas is available, do we?                    Well, let me just stop you there.   Do you want this Court to rule on whether or not there are military exigencies that require the holding and detention of these enemy combatants?                  Putting aside the battlefield hypothetical, we're talking about Guantanamo.   Your argument is that somebody held one day in Guantanamo has the right to habeas.                   So the extent of detention is irrelevant to your assertion.                   What is the relevance to your -- this line of reasoning to the recent enactment by Congress of section 1005(g), which says that the base at Guantanamo is not part of the United States?   There is a judgment by the political branches that we don't exercise sovereignty over the leasehold, and it seems to me that, if we're going to adhere to our habeas corpus cases, we would have to reject that determination.                    So to determine whether there's jurisdiction, in every case we have to go through a multi factor analysis to determine if the United States exercises not sovereignty, which you've rejected as the touchstone, but sufficient control over a particular military base?             Over the Philippines during World War II, in Vietnam, and it is going to decide in some cases whether the control is sufficient and others whether it isn't?                    And that is a judgment we the Court would make, not the political branches who have to deal with the competing sovereignties in those situations?                     We'll give you your rebuttal time.                    Mr. Waxman, this determination, whether it's sovereignty or subjugation or control of non-sovereign territory, would, I expect, have diplomatic consequences.               It is, I think, typically an act of war for one country to assert authority and control over another country's jurisdiction. And here we have Section 1005G where Congress and the President have agreed that Guantanamo Bay is not part of the United States, and, yet, you would have this Court issue a ruling saying that it is subject to the total, complete domination and control, or whatever the factors are. What is the reaction of the Cuban government to be to that?                  We -- there are -- am I wrong that there are Cuban workers who come on to the base and work?                   So if you have two of those workers and they get into a fight over something, one can't sue the other in Cuban courts?                   What authority -- what authority do you have for that:                      That such a suit would not lie in the Cuban court?                  Thank you, General Clement. Mr. Waxman, we'll give you five minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH W. WAXMAN. ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                    That is an argument that, I gather, both sides agree is available to you under the DTA before the D.C. Circuit.
06-1204 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-1204, Republic of the Philippines v. Pimentel, et al. Mr. Rothfeld. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Why couldn't -- why couldn't the Philippines, not having been a party in this action, pursued whoever did get the assets from this action --                   -- in normal litigation, if they objected to the resolution.                   I guess they weren't there for the adjudication on the merits.                   Well, is it -- is it fair to the private claimants here in the United States to say, wait until the Philippine court renders a judgment in favor of the Philippines, and then they can come in and enforce the judgment against Merrill Lynch or whomever is holding the assets?                   Well, under the determination of the Philippine court.                    But the court here could determine that they're the private claimants' assets, as it did.                     Well, you just told me that the Philippines court may judge the opposite without the participation of the private claimants.                     That seems to me to be an argument on the merits, rather than with respect to which case should proceed first.                   Would the private claimants be able to undermine the added force of the judgment in the Philippines, assuming a proceeding is brought here, on the ground that they were not allowed to participate in the proceeding in the Philippines?                     Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER                   Mr. Kneedler, getting back to your previous point, why isn't the Philippine National -- why don't -- why doesn't the Philippine National Bank adequately represent the interest of the Republic?            Under Philippine law, as I understand, any recovery by the bank in this case would be the property of the Philippines.                   Well, they are -- they're certainly subject to Philippine law, and I understand that there's no dispute that under Philippine law the assets would be taken from the Philippine National Bank for the benefit of the government.                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rothfeld, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITONER
06-1221 +++$+++                     We'll hear argument this morning in case 06-1221, Sprint/United Management Company v. Mendelsohn. Mr. Cane. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL W. CANE, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  You agree that it has to be a case-by-case determination?                    There's no absolute rule either way?                  So I assume it would be addressed as it was here, in a motion in limine, the plaintiff would say here are the witnesses we intend to call; the company would say we don't think they're relevant because, as you say, there's no connection between them, and then the judge would decide.                  That's on the issue of relevance.                    Would that be done typically at the motion in limine stage?                     I mean, do you establish whether or not there was discrimination in the "me, too" cases at trial or prior to the trial, outside the jury's --                     What about the spreadsheet evidence?        I thought there was some effort to show a connection through the spreadsheet showing the age of the dismissed employees?                      Your theory doesn't depend on where in the hierarchy the other supervisors are located, I take it, if there's a connection?                   In other words, if there's a lower-level supervisor who discriminates and that is somehow communicated to the supervisor in question, and whatever -- that you know, the point is that the other one wasn't disciplined or something, that would still -- under your theory that would be admissible, correct?                  No, I'm talking about a situation -- let's say it is a lower-level supervisor outside the chain of command who commits another "me, too" act, but that is communicated to the other in a way that suggests, for example, that the company tolerates it or accepts it. I take it that that would be potentially admissible subject to 403 under your theory.                   Thank you, Mr. Cane. Mr. Garre. OPENING ARGUMENT BY GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE                   That's under -- under 401, it's not always admissible, or do you need 403 to reach that conclusion?                   But do you think there are situations where other-supervisor evidence is not admissible under 401 itself?                    The determination of the relevance of the "me, too" evidence -- and I assume also the 403 status -- needs to be made at the motion in limine stage, or is it a question for the jury?                    So if it's -- if on the "me, too" evidence it's a "he said/she said" type of case, does that get admitted to the jury?                      Or is that excluded at the motion in limine stage?                  Well, they're only -- it is only relevant, of course, if it is true; and if the company denies that the "me, too" episode even took place, don't you have to have a separate trial on that before you can determine whether it's even admissible?                  Well, I get back to my -- the predicate to my question.                      It's only relevant if it happened.                  And it seems to me we've had a lot of discussion whether it is relevant if it happened, but we don't know how we determine whether it happened or not.                   So an allegation -- an allegation of discrimination in a "me, too" context is automatically relevant?                      Mr. Cane, you have five minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL W.

WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   I'd like you to address the distinction between the medical device area and the drug area because in the medical device area, of course, you have an express pre-emption clause, while here in contrast you don't.                  If that's true you would have expected the Federal Drug Act to have a similar express pre-emption provision.                  And one reason perhaps that it didn't is that when the Drug Act was passed you had an established background of State actions; when the Medical Device Act was passed you didn't.                    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER                   Thank you, counsel.

06-1286 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-1286, Michael Knight, Trustee, v. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Mr. Rubin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. RUBIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  Counsel, you agree that as a taxpayer seeking an exception to a general rule, you have the burden of proof in this case?                  We can't take -- I guess it's not judicial notice, but we can't assume that individual investors with several million dollars of liquid assets might hire investment advisors?                  Do they usually hire investment advisors?                  I guess you'd concede, wouldn't you, that you're not entitled to all of the investment advice that you receive but perhaps only that that is related to the trust status?                  In other words, if your investment advisor charges you $50,000 and, you know, 10,000 of it is unique to the trust, but 40,000 is the same sort of advice he'd give an individual, you'd only be able to get the 10,000 outside of the 2 percent limit?                   But they don't have to hire investment advisors.              There is a standard that they may think they can meet on their own.                   They may -- you know, it may be an investment advisor that is the trustee.   He doesn't have to hire somebody else. So it's not something that necessarily inheres in the nature of the trust.                   Why -- if I could pause you on that, why is that the case?                   Let's say it's a -- the trustee understands perfectly his obligations under the law.    Let's just say he is supposed to preserve capital and invest conservatively, but he wants advice on which is the best conservative investment. You know, is it railroads or is it utilities?     And that's the investment advice he seeks -- just that.     He says:     I know how I'm supposed to invest as a fiduciary, but there are options in there, and I just want advice on the options.                   Well, isn't that just like an individual investor?                  If you have an individual investor with $10 million in liquid assets, he or she might know what he wants to do, either capital appreciation or preservation, you know, whatever the option is, but just wants some advice on how best to go about that.     That sounds exactly like the trustee in our hypothetical.                      No.   No.    No.   You see, that's my difficulty with your position.                      It's not uniquely trust because you certainly have individuals who may want income rather than capital appreciation or, you know, preservation of capital.                   They may have exactly the same objectives as a trustee.                    It's not unique to the trust.                   Okay.     Well, then let's take that.   Let's suppose that the trustee goes to an investment advisor, doesn't tell him that he is a trustee, just says, I need to know, I can't decide, should I invest in Union Pacific or CSX?                   I'm going to invest in a railroad; which one do you like better?                       He doesn't tell him he's a trustee, gets some advice and gets a bill.   Is that subject to the 2 percent floor, because presumably the advice has got nothing to do with fiduciary responsibilities?                   Oh, no.     It's a reasonable -- let's say a railroad stock is a reasonable investment for a trust.        He just wants to know which one is the best one.                    How can it be distinctive if the advisor doesn't even know that the person's a trustee?                   Well, when it's filled out --                   -- he knows it's on Form 1041 rather than 1040.                   Thank you, Mr. Miller. Mr. Rubin, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. RUBIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    But it could also be tailored to an individual with particular circumstances that are similar to that of the trust.                    So an individual could incur it.     An individual with the same amount of money involved probably would incur it.                   So an individual might have more than one child he wants to provide for and as far as a remainder, there may be more than one grandchild.    It could be exactly the same -- an individual could have exactly the same objectives as a trustee.
06-1287 +++$+++                    And do you want the district court to in addition determine which methodology most accurately reflects that true market value?                   You want to be able to challenge the state's chosen methodology for determining market value?                   So if the, so if the district court says this methodology, Methodology A, most accurately yields true market value, that is giving rise to a Federal rule of determining value, isn't it?                     Well, I don't see how it varies based on the particular circumstances.                         If he says I think, you know, whatever it is, discounted value approach is the best way for determining market value, he's not going to in the next case or the district court isn't going to be able to say, I think reproduction cost is the best method.                     You're going to establish a Federal rule for what is the best way of determining market value.                     That happens, that happens once every 25 years.             If you prevail on a method that you think is more favorable to railroads before a particular district court, you're going to cite that district court in the next case that you've got and you say:     Look a district court's already looked at this and they said Method A is a better way of determining market value.                   So if a district court says in one case Method A is the best way to get market value and another district court says Method B and they both appeal, the court of appeals is going to have to resolve that conflict, isn't it?                   Well, but it's already been pointed out if the range is a variable of $4 billion I think it probably is worth their while to challenge what they think is a low valuation.                      What if we were to adopt a different approach which said that you can challenge the methodology, methodology, when different methodologies are used, but if the State is using the same methodology that's their choice?                     It seems to me the only other alternative is to have the Federal judiciary develop a Federal rule about what methodology has to be used.                   Isn't that how it works in utility rate regulation?               Isn't there in fact a standard Federal method of determining what rates affect the taking of property --                   Yes, if it's challenged --                   The rate of return in a public utility.                    Well, more often than not.   But in fact it is an ultimate finding of fact, but it's based on valuation methodology and that's what's at issue here.       No one doubts that the application of a methodology can be challenged.                  The question is whether or not if you start out -- I reached these facts because I used reproduction costs as my method of valuation, and your submission is going to be that vastly overvalues our property and you should use a different method.    That's a legal question.                That's not a method -- question of fact.                      What if the district court -- what if there is one methodology that gets you an answer within 20 percent margin of error, up or down, and there is another methodology that gives you an answer with a 5 percent margin of error, up or down? Can you challenge the application of one of those as opposed to the other.                      Well, of course you can challenge it.                      My question -- my question assumes that the methodology leads to a value that is either 20 percent higher or lower in one case, and 5 percent higher or lower in the other case.                    Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURAIE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER                    Were all of the values that were arrived at in this case within the ballpark?                    Were all the valuations used here reliable indications of true market value?                    Well, there is no way to tell.     Everybody agrees we're just making more or less educated guesses.                  And so the district court has to engage in purely fictional enterprise, and say yes, all the methodologies give you a range of 6 to 12 billion, but I think the answer is 8.2 billion.                  Thank you, Mr. Calvert. Mr. Phillips, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    I mean I assume that's in the normal context of the adversary process. In other words, the district court does not necessarily have to come up with a number independent of what the parties present to it.                    It can decide which of the presentations is closer to true market value.
06-1321 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument first today in Case No. 06-1321, Gomez-Perez v. Potter. Mr. Guerra. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. GUERRA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   No, it's not.    I mean, a company could have a policy of firing everybody who complains about anything and the fact that a worker is over the age of 40 and is fired does not mean that he is being fired because of age.                    Of course the statute that covers age discrimination in the private sector does have an express provision addressing retaliation.   The one that governs Federal employees does not, and that's the government's main argument, that it's expressed in the private sector, it's not there in the public sector and so you shouldn't imply one.   What's your answer to that?                   The Federal employee, though, has all of the remedies under the Civil Service Reform Act for any type of employment practice.    Those remedies are elaborately reticulated and almost impenetrable, and yet this would add complication.    In other words, despite all the remedies under the CSRA that says in some cases you go here, in other cases you go here, and you get different types of review depending on the facts, all of that would be wiped away if you can bring a direct action under the age discrimination statute.                     But not retaliation claims.   In other words, although the direct claims, as you put it, may or may not be carved out, a retaliation claim fits under the employment practices provisions of the CSRA, regardless of the basis for retaliation.                   In other words, you took personnel action against me for an impermissible basis and therefore I'm entitled to the various civil service remedies.                   But it does that for a reason.   We have a lot of cases in the Federal Circuit and the D.C. Circuit that addresses a lot of these problems say that when the CSRA excludes certain types of claims of employees, they do it for a reason.                 In other words, it's not simply that they didn't cover them or inadvertence, but they make the decision that the remedies that they've provided don't apply in a particular case.   And to say that those people who are excluded under the CSRA nonetheless have remedies for employment practices seems to me to undermine that -- that judgment.                   When you qualified your answer by saying that the employee can control, was that a way to dismiss the collective bargaining rights?                   What about review under -- by the Merit Systems Protection Board?                   So when you're talking about the Office of Special Counsel --                    Well, another reason it's not that simple is that under the Age Discrimination Act you have a private remedy that specifically provides for retaliation.                    And that is noticeably absent from the Federal remedy.                    And I thought that was the strongest argument on the government's side.                    I thought there was a more express incorporation in Title VII of the private anti-retaliation remedy, and you don't have that in this case.                      So that makes it not precisely the same situation.                  Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Guerra, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. GUERRA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  Is that because they may not engage in collective bargaining, or because they have chosen not to?                     I suppose that's consistent with whatever prohibition it is that precludes them from engaging in collective bargaining.                     So you think we do have to decide the Title VII question if you are to prevail.
06-1322 +++$+++                     We'll hear argument next in Case 06-1322, Federal Express Corporation v. Holowecki. Ms. Lensing. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CONNIE L. LENSING ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  Well, I think -- I think you're right about that.               I mean, once the lawyer's involved and they're in litigation and all that, they're not going to take conciliation efforts with the same light as before. But the question is whether the remedy for that, which is some unfairness to you, is to throw the suit out or try to fix it as much as possible, such as through a stay or dismissing without prejudice or something. Why should the Plaintiff -- it's not his fault that the EEOC didn't notify you.                    Why should he suffer the categorical sanction of dismissal simply because it's a little unfairness to you?                  Do we know -- perhaps this is a question your friend on the other side will be able to answer better than you.                     But do we know where she got the form, why she filled it out?                     I couldn't find in the record whether this was given to her by someone at the EEOC or whether she downloaded it from the website or what.                    I agree completely with everything you said.          I just don't understand your leap from government incompetence to saying the plaintiff loses.                      Do you think Ms. Kennedy is entitled to equitable tolling in this case?                      I guess she, reasonably or otherwise, thought there already was a lawsuit.                  Did you undertake conciliation efforts after her formal, her filing of the Form 5 charge?                   Counsel, the Government relied in its brief very heavily on the Chevron case, saying we should defer to the agency's regulations, and on the Auer case, saying we defer to the agency to tell us what its regulations mean.                    And you didn't cite either of those cases in your reply brief.    So I wonder what your answer is to that argument.                    And you're only -- when you say you're hurt, the only prejudice that you rely on is the fact that you didn't have an opportunity to go through prelitigation conciliation.                    But -- but my point is, you're not alleging prejudice from the lack of prompt notice.   In other words, it's not a situation where you'd say if we had notice we would have done this, and that would have prevented everything.                    Your only prejudice is the lack of conciliation period.                   Thank you, Mr. Heytens. Miss Lensing, you have a minute left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CONNIE L.

Mr. Howley. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J.P. HOWLEY, ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS                  Well, that brings up the basic question I have, is this a question of State law or Federal law?                  So even if you have different rules in different States, there is going to be one rule under Federal law under 1605(a)(4)?                   Well, they just may be more sympathetic to India and Mongolia than they were to Libya.                  Thank you, Mr. Howley. Mr. Srinivasan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS                   I thought that the Department submitted a good brief on this issue, but in 1985.   What do you do with all the arguments -- I'm looking at page 12 of your brief in the Englewood case, which you argued that these liens were interests in property.    Are those arguments no longer valid?                   The other reasons you gave, the holder of a lien can bring an action to enjoin waste, holders of liens are entitled to compensation if eminent domain is exercised.                 All of those reasons are still as valid as they were in 1985.                      Well, how can the, how can the lien holder then bring an action to enjoin waste of the immovable property?                   Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Howley, you have two minutes remaining.

06-1413 +++$+++                    We will hear argument next in Case 06-1413, MeadWestvaco v. The Illinois Department of Revenue. Ms. Brinkmann. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  To Ohio?                  Ms. Brinkmann, you begin your brief by saying this, a paper company, that happens to own a data processing company.                 Why couldn't you equally say this is a data processing company that happens to own a paper company?                  Well, and Lexis/Nexis has been a data processing company since whenever.                  It's not the oldest -- whichever is oldest isn't the one that gets to be regarded as the dominant partner, is it?                  Is General Electric a light bulb company or, since it owns NBC, a media company.                   Well, that's because they sell paper in Illinois?                   Well, Lexis sells data services in Illinois, too.                   Well, why doesn't -- I mean, you just said, as I understand it, Illinois has the right to tax Lexis under business activities in Illinois.    Illinois would argue the reason it has a capital gain is partly because they were doing business in Illinois and so we should be entitled to part of that capital gain.    Almost -- I mean, it seems to me it would be pretty easy if they get to tax 2 percent of Lexis's business, well then maybe they should get 2 percent of the capital gain when it's sold or tax 2 percent.                   Well, isn't it kind of like futures hedging?        I mean, you've got a paper company and then you've got something that is sort of the paperless aspect, and they can look at it and say, well, we're kind of hedging our paper business by investing heavily in something that's supposedly going to take away the need for paper.                    Ms. Brinkmann, one thing that concerns me is how this will complicate the process.    I think, with respect to ordinary income, the States work this out, and they figure we get 5 percent because we have 5 percent of the presence or business, whatever. Now, they're going to have that, and they're going to have an overlay on that.                  They're going to say, well, it's 5 percent; but, you know, we sold this asset that doesn't have any connection to Illinois; and that's part of the income we've got.               So you don't get quite 5 percent of all. And another -- Illinois is going to come back and say, well, yes, but you sold this other one; and, as to that one, you've got sufficient connection with Illinois.    It seems to me it's going to be impossible to sort this out.                    Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Brinkmann, you have three minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Ms. Brinkmann, your final point.                   Ms. Brinkmann, on the waiver point -- I'm looking at page 18a -- it not only says that Lexis/Nexis contributed $46 million from its presence in Illinois; it begins the sentence by saying "as the Department notes, $46 million of Mead's income came from Lexis/Nexis activities in Illinois." So that doesn't sound like a waiver of that point to me.                   Initially, it's about the context in which -- what I regard as an important fact -- was raised, whether it was raised in the context of an argument on unitary business or whether or not they went too far, but the stubborn fact is still there.
06-1431 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument this morning in Case 06-1431, CBOCS West v. Humphries. Mr. Hawkins. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. HAWKINS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Now, is your position that in that situation a retaliation is not covered by 1981?                   I would have thought that you could argue that it's direct discrimination. In other words, if you're fired, whatever form the retaliation takes, that, as Justice Ginsburg suggests, that that would be on the basis -- basis of race.                 And I thought your position, or at least your position could be narrowed to say it's only when the individual against whom the retaliation takes place is not the individual complaining of the direct discrimination that your position would be pertinent.                   Well, that's right. That's why I thought the person directly discriminated against would be able to phrase the retaliation claim certainly as a discrimination claim.                   We do have those recent cases, but we also have the Sullivan case interpreting -- interpreting 1982, which arose under the prior approach to these questions.                 And my question for you is:   Under principles of stare decisis, which body do we follow, the earlier case interpreting 1982 under the more freewheeling approach to statutory interpretation or this later body of law that says we're not going to do that any more?                  Thank you, General. Mr. Hawkins, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. HAWKINS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
06-1456 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-1456, Cuellar versus United States. Mr. Beard. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERRY V. BEARD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    Well, he certainly concealed the location.          They were secreted in the car, under the goat hair and everything else.                   The location of the money was certainly concealed.                     But why -- why isn't this transporting to conceal the location or the ownership in this sense?           Suppose you have someone the police suspect of engaging in drug activities.                   They know he sold, you know, so much marijuana or whatever and got cash back.      They think it's there, and they're going to investigate it, but this fellow comes in and they transport the proceeds across the border. Isn't that transportation to conceal the location or the ownership?                      Well, they think it's there, but they're not sure, and they -- you know, that would help them make their case, to find out that the guy they think sold the drugs has $80,000.                   So they get a search warrant or whatever, and it turns out he doesn't, because it's been transported to conceal the location or ownership.                  Counsel, can I ask you to go back to Justice Stevens's line of questioning? If -- do you conceal the nature of proceeds if you conceal the proceeds?                   Well, that -- that doesn't seem to follow.          I understand the argument with "nature."     In other words, you're not concealing the nature; it's just not there.              But when you're hiding it, you are concealing the location.                   Well, that gets me to a question.     Several times you've referenced the attributes.     Are you saying that the statute would have a different meaning if it just said "location"?                   Well, you better explain that a little more for me.                   Because they seem to me the same.                   Okay, so hiding location assumes it's going to come up later.                   And if you just hide the money, you assume he's just going to leave it somewhere and forget about it?                  Well, the "more" is they don't hold it under your name.                      They hold it under a numerical account number.             Then that changes everything?                     Thank you, Mr. Beard.                      Thank you, Ms. Schertler.

SCHLEIMER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    Well, It wouldn't eliminate it.   Your friend on the other side says it the simply delays it, because you get to arbitrate de novo after the commissioner's decision.                    Well, I guess I could let him answer, but I suppose he would say you go to that court, and you get a motion to compel arbitration.                  Counsel, I have to confess I've never understood these choice of alaw provisions.    You incorporate California law.                I assume California law is interpreted consistent with Federal law.   If Federal law preempts California law, that's what you're incorporating.           It always struck me as kind of circular.                  When you say California law applies, you don't mean to the exclusion of Federal law?                   Counsel, would you have any problem with a California law that said you can arbitrate but the arbitrator must allow the Labor Commissioner to file an amicus brief?                   What if it goes on and says, and you must allow the Labor Commissioner to appear at the arbitration?                   So, what if it says you've got to wait for 30 days to allow the Labor Commissioner to consider whether or not to intervene?                     How was the arbitrator chosen?      Does he or she have any particular expertise in this area?                    Mr. Schleimer, you have nine minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH D. SCHLEIMER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Well, your friend says that this agency has exactly that power, and the reason you required these things to go before her, is that she knows what's going on in the area and, if appropriate, can take the supervisory authority or whatever the equivalent of prosecutorial action is.

RUSSELL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                  Well, your friend, of course, makes the point that the age discrimination prohibition is narrower in scope than Title VII, that there are more likely to be instances in which a reasonable factor other than age came into play than there would be a basis for discrimination on the basis of race.                    Well, but the facts -- I mean, given discovery, that doesn't seem a very compelling case.    Once you require the employer to come up -- in other words, the burden of production -- and say, well, the reason we did it was this, then it's just a matter of discovery.        The plaintiff can say, oh, well, then let me depose that person who is the head of, you know, whatever the department.               If it's for safety reasons, for some reason, or training issues, well, then we depose the person who is in charge of training or safety and ask them those questions.                     And it doesn't seem to me that the fact that the employer possesses the information, given very liberal discovery we have, is much of a factor.                    Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Joseffer. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS                   These are not words. They are operative provisions of law.                  Counsel, I was surprised not to see Chevron cited in your brief.                  What -- what sort of deference do you think we should give the EEOC regulations here?                  I'm sorry.       I thought Auer deference tells you how to interpret the regulation.   And having once interpreted the regulation, you need to know what to do with it.                  We know what the regulation -- we give it deference; we know what the regulation means.    Now, does that regulation, as understood in light of Auer deference, get Chevron deference or something else?                   Why is it proving a negative?   They would just have to prove that it was or was not a reasonable factor other than age.                  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Russell, you have four minutes remaining.

We don't have to decide whether this diversion was with respect to stock, because you put that at issue, and you weren't allowed to make that --                   I suppose it would be open on remand for the Government to argue it was not with respect to stock for the reasons that have come out, that it was just a diversion?                   Thank you, Ms. Maynard. Mr. Cline, you have four -- ten minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. CLINE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Where is that evidence?     If he has the burden of coming forward with it, I assume that means in the proffer.                   And where is it?                   Justice Breyer's point is that that isn't directed to that issue.                     It's directed to the issue of whether he was using the funds for a corporate purpose.                   And that evidence came in after the proffer, didn't it?                   Well, this is a motion in limine which is before the trial.                   Well, it's kind of hard to say it's with respect to stock when the other stockholder doesn't get any.                     What page in your brief did you say?                     Of your reply brief?

CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   There wouldn't be tax -- taxpayer standing, but of course there would be regular Article III standing in the sense that in a party claiming to be injured because they didn't get a grant, and a religious organization did, and the reason was religion, can bring any kind of claim they want under Article III.      It's just they wouldn't qualify for the special exception to the general rule that there is no taxpayer standing for establishment clause cases.                  Any, presumably any other denomination that is not of the established church could bring a challenge that they're being discriminated against, because they're favoring a particular church over them.   Your proposition is simply that somebody -- somebody in Oregon can't challenge the fact that they're building a church in Florida simply because the person in Florida pays taxes, right?                   Under that, under that approach, when a U.S. Marshal executes a search and there's a Fourth Amendment claim that the search is illegal, that's really a challenge to the appropriation of the Marshals Service on an as-applied basis.

Even if there's no link, there's no link to the person that the original -- the complainant says was engaged in that activity?                  So if Mr. Jones, the person, did that, that's terrible.                  That's actionable as opposition to the practices?                  Well, but, you know, that's why we ask hypotheticals that aren't related to the specific facts, because we're interested in how broadly the proposition you're asking for goes.                  I'd still like to find out where you draw the limit.                  What if the person says:      Mr. Jones would never do anything like that, but if he did that would be terrible.                       Now, is that actionable as opposition?                    And those are overlapping but not whatever it -- concurring --                    -- positions.     You can oppose without participating.

BLATT ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER                    In that case, doesn't the opposing employee herself have a direct cause of action under Title VII?               Given what Ms. Crawford described, you know, "that happened to me, too," she could proceed under Title VII herself.                   Would you go as far as Mr. Schnapper in determining what constitutes "opposition"?   I mean, do you agree with him that a case where somebody says, "oh, Mr. Jones would never do that, and if he did, I think that would be awful" -- is that "opposition"?                   Yes, yes, I know, but -- I know, but --                   Facts that would constitute unlawful activity.               What about facts that -- I mean, many of these cases, of course, are he-said/she-said cases, and what about the facts that you are reporting confirm one side or the other?                   They just ask you, look -- and, you know, the person says, "Well, every day at three o'clock he came in and do this," and you're outside.            And he says, "No, I wasn't there."                   Are you opposing it if you say -- you know, you are asked, "Well, you know, you sit outside the office; did he come in there or not?"     And you say, "Yes, he did."                   Even you knew that that was the critical fact in resolving the complaint?                   The opposition clause is?                   Well, it depends how you define the investigation --                   -- the inquiry, and that's kind of a tough issue, it seems to me.                   Right.                   Well, I guess the question I was asking earlier, you have overlapping but not concentric categories, so the "opposing" may be broader than the "participating in" depending upon how we define either one.                  I'm sorry.   Have held what?                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Schnapper, you have four minutes remaining.

06-1646 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-1646, United States v. Rodriguez. Mr. Shanmugam. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   You seem to -- you seem to flinch from the natural consequences of your position in not looking at the maximum for a particular offender.   For example, you know, under some guidelines, if he was the ringleader his sentence can be enhanced beyond what would otherwise be the maximum for a first-time offender, but you say you don't take that into consideration.                  How is that different from your position here, where it is the fact that the individual is a recidivist that causes you to look to a different maximum?                  So that's the reason you sort of pull back from a more aggressive reading, because it's not as broad a category?                  Well, but only if they're subject -- only if they have some characteristic that had caused the State legislature to give the higher maximum, such as being the ringleader or some other enhancement.                   Surely not, Mr. Shanmugam.   You were talking about broad categories earlier.   It seemed that the broad category in the situation you posit would be the normal offender rather than the recidivist, and that's the one we ought to look at.                   Well, I know, but you began your discussion by saying we had to choose one maximum.     You were accepting that requirement.                   It seems to me, if that's the case, it's clear that we ought to pick the maximum for the particular offense without considering additional enhancements.                   But you don't accept that approach when we're talking about enhancements under State guidelines.         You know, if the normal sentence is whatever it is, 10 years, and you get an extra 2 years if you're the ringleader, you say no, you don't look at that; you just look at the 10 years.

Mr. Garre. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF PETE GEREN, SECRETARY OF THE ARMY, ET AL.                  So once again you're relying on a concurring opinion by Justice Douglas?                     And I suppose if he were -- it would make a huge difference whether such an individual were released in the United States as opposed to being released in Iraq.                    Is there a limit to your proposition?    In other words, let's stipulate that the individuals are going to be released in a situation where you know that they won't receive anything resembling due process and will be subject to abuse. What happens in that case?  that -- do you concede that habeas is concerned with the safety of the individual as opposed to his custody?                     So a habeas court here has to look at all those different factors and come to a determination of whether it has jurisdiction? There's no bright line?          It has to look at whether hostilities have ceased or haven't ceased?                  It's got to look at how far the prisoners have been removed from the zone of hostility?                  The the 20,000-plus people being retained, are they all in connection with security threats?     Or do they involve what I guess we could call common criminals?
06-1717 +++$+++                       We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-1717, Richlin Security Service versus Chertoff. Mr. Wolfman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   I'm sorry.    Is your point there that most associates are billed at less than $125 an hour?                   Too much money proportionally.                   Okay.                   I'm sorry. "Traditionally subsumed in the lawyer's rate," are you suggesting, when this statute was passed, they weren't billed separately to the client?                   But that's -- I saw that analysis.    This Act only applies when the government's position is not substantially justified. People are not going to structure their billing arrangements assuming the government's position is not even going to be substantially justified.                  That point makes some assumptions about the relative abilities, say, of junior associates and senior paralegals, and I'm not sure are well founded. (Laughter.)                    Is that pertinent -- is that pertinent on the cap questions we've been discussing too?    I mean, if you're representing a disabled veteran, is the lawyer typically charging more than $125 an hour?                  And of course they may mean -- may have meant costs to the client.                  Thank you, Mr. Yang. Mr. Wolfman, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  Well, but I think Justice Breyer is correct, isn't he, that there was no reason for the Senate to sort of redo a report that they had already done on a bill that was substantially identical?                  There was no Senate report because they had done it just the previous year.
06-179 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-179, Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc. Ms. Zieve. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  Isn't that situation addressed by the requirement that the manufacturer alert the FDA to new information and at least file annual reports, and then the FDA can pull back the pre-market approval if they think these problems require it to do so?                    Right.   I thought that was your -- your theory was a little more nuanced. In other words, they don't require you to market a particular catheter.      And you -- what I understood you to be arguing is that there may be a better design and that it was negligent for the manufacturer to market a particular design, even though they're allowed to; they don't have to.                    They should have made the change to make it safer, right?                    Well, if that's --                    Well, if that's what happens, what, as a -- what's going to happen for patients at a time when your theory comes up, the manufacturer looks at it and says, well, maybe this is a better device; we don't want to risk these tort suits, so we're going to stop selling our old device that's been approved, but now we have got to get FDA approval of the new device and that might take forever or at least a year, let's say.          And what happens to patients in that year?    They've got no device.                  But your theory is that although this device has been approved, here's a better one.    And it's negligent on the manufacturer's part to market a device, even though approved by the FDA, when there's a better one that would reduce the risks.                  What do you want them to do if you think it's negligent for them to market the approved product?             Don't you want them to take it off the market?                   It's not that it is not reasonably safe.      It's that another design would be safer.   And you think that's a basis for negligence because you say, yeah, the FDA approved it, but that doesn't mean they required the manufacturer to market that device.                     So that's just like a car speedometer.      I mean, the speedometer goes up to 120 miles an hour, but that doesn't mean you are supposed to drive it that fast.                    Ms. Zieve, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    Didn't the Court -- didn't the majority of the Court reject that line in Lohr?                  Thank you.                  If I could -- I'm sorry -- I've been thinking about your example of ambiguity.    You're saying it is ambiguous when they say you can inflate it up to the bursting pressure or until the blockage is cleared?                  Well, doesn't that obvious mean if the blockage is clear, you don't keep inflating it to the bursting pressure.                    You think that doctors read that as saying you can inflate it past the bursting pressure unless -- if the blockage isn't cleared?                     Even though the label said eight is the bursting pressure?                     Okay.
06-219 +++$+++                     We'll hear argument next in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson. General Garre. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                    I think it needs a little upcranking. Good.                  Were any of these administrative actions found to be unfounded?                     In other words, did he win any of the trespass citations?                      Counsel, I -- I think part of what's happening here is there is difference between the regulation on the books and how they are enforced.      Just as a hypothetical, let's say they don't -- the Government doesn't get its reciprocal easement that it wants, and so it says look, we normally don't strictly enforce these cattle trespass things, but we are going to go by the book with this guy until he gives us the right-of-way.            Every time his cattle cross over the line we are going to hit him with a trespass citation.   They don't do it for anybody else but, they're going to do it for him because they want to get the reciprocal right-of-way.              Is that appropriate or inappropriate?                     So that he can't -- but you're saying his remedy is to challenge each one. But actually each one, his cattle did trespass, so he doesn't have a good case.            It's just that out in the West they don't actually give citations every time a cow crosses the river.                   So you're suggesting they would not be immune from a State law trespass action?                  Mr. Garre, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY C. GARRE, FOR PETITIONERS                  Well, then why did you revoke it later, if it wasn't valid?                  But their argument is broader.    It says you can't look at each little piece.   You've got to look at the overall structure, and overall they are doing it to extort a property right they don't want to pay for, and they are not doing -- other people's cattle cross over and they don't prosecute them. Now, let's assume that's correct on the facts.   Are you saying that they have no remedy for that type of extortionate activity?
06-278 +++$+++                     The Court will hear argument first today in case 06-278, Morse vs. Frederick. Mr. Starr. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                     But the problem -- the problem, Mr. Starr, is that school boards these days take it upon themselves to broaden their mission well beyond education or protection from illegal substances, and several of the briefs have pointed out school boards have adopted policies taking on the whole range of political issues.    Now, do they get to dictate the content of speech on all of those issues simply because they have adopted that as the part of their educational mission?                     Well, I think that -- I think you're right about that, and I guess my question goes to how broadly we should read Tinker.                  I mean, why is it that the classroom ought to be a forum for political debate simply because the students want to put that on their agenda?           Presumably the teacher's agenda is a little bit different and includes things like teaching Shakespeare or the Pythagorean Theorem, and just because political speech is on the student's agenda, I'm not sure that it makes sense to read Tinker so broadly as to include protection of those, that speech.                     Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS                    So -- so you think that the, not a 15 foot banner but a very discrete button that says "legalize marijuana," although it might be covered as not being disruptive under Tinker, it could be inconsistent with the school's mission and prohibited on that basis?

SPILLARS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Well, we didn't -- haven't applied it to a penalty phase closing argument, but we've certainly applied the general standard to the penalty phase.                  I'm sorry, counsel. Maybe, counsel, if you could answer that question?                  Counsel, I'm looking at the quote, the statement, the reference to Patton, and I have to say I don't read it as imposing a duty. It says what the prosecutor says is that sometimes you've got to kill and sometimes you've got to risk death because it's right.          His point is that at some point, at some times, you have to impose death because it's right, not because it's your duty as a soldier. Now, where is the reference to you have this duty as a soldier in the prosecutor's statements?                   If those direct Federal cases were interpreting the constitutional provisions directly, they would count as established law?                  Thank you, Mr. Blume.

06-376 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument next in case 06-376, Hinck vs. United States. Mr. Redding. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. REDDING ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                    But not with respect to abatement of interest in particular.                   But why would you not want some -- a larger taxpayer to be able to proceed in the tax court if you can also proceed in the claims court?                     But you have no basis for an abatement of interest action apart from 6404(h), correct?    That is the only place you get the actual cause of action to sue for abatement of interest?                     But what would you cite to, in response to the prior cases that said you had no cause of action for abasement of interest?                     But the one I'm looking at just has (e)(1).              Did you have a page number?                  Well, sure.      But -- but that's just saying, if --              you used to have the entitlement under (e)(2) and you're saying well, you could bring cases under (e)(2).               But 6404(h) allows you to bring cases under (e)(1).             It would follow a fortiori that you could bring them for (e)(2) as well, but that doesn't prove that you could prove them under (e)(1) in the claims court or the district court.                   But if you went into the district court and claimed that the failure to abate interest was an abuse of discretion, what would you rely on for the -- for the cause of action?                   I thought the prior cases consistently, consistently said that there was no judicial review because it was "may abate" and that it was only with the arrival of 6404(h)(1) that there was a cause of action for abuse of discretion?                   So you want to look at 6404(h)(1) saying now we have a standard, but you don't want the other stuff that goes along with 6404(h)(1), which is it's in the tax court; you got to have less than ten million, blah, blah, blah?                    Of course, there's a fundamental difference on this particular question between pay and sue and sue --                    -- prepay, because if you -- in the district court if you're paying and suing you're not really subject to the accrual of interest, right?                    If I owe the IRS, 1,000 dollars and they send me a bill and I paid the 1,000 dollars, they've got the money, I don't.                 So I don't owe interest on that, do I?                     The initial bill includes the interest?                     But still, in the tax court situation it's still accruing?                  Thank you Mr. Marcus. Mr. Redding, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. REDDING, ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

One thing I couldn't clearly discern from your brief is the significance you attached to the defendant's, defense failure to object. How does that enter into our analysis?                   I thought Justice Stevens's articulation of Judge Kozinski's opinion was exactly right but I thought you would in response cite us to page 208a where the Washington Supreme Court said that those jurors' views, including Mr. Deal, would have prevented or substantially impaired their ability to follow the court's instructions and abide by their oaths as jurors. It seems the court of appeals judge overlooked that.                   Is this something particular under Washington procedure, this summary and conclusions section at the end of the opinion?                   All right.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN MAHONEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   What about if, what if the association had a rule that members, school officials, shall not criticize the decisions of the association?                  It's germane.     In other words, you can criticize other things, but if you're going to join this group we think it's important for their public stature not to be criticized by members.                  There's no more public concern about when spring practice is.                If you think there should be, you know, two playoff tiers rather than three and you criticize the association for that and they say well, you're suspended for a year and all that.                  What about criticizing officials?                  No, I mean three days later, you know, the school -- the coach writes an editorial saying there were lousy calls in the game last week.                  And what is the interest behind the anti-recruiting rule?                  They could have determined that it's particularly harmful to the public schools who don't have the option of recruiting while the private schools do?

What if the mailing was limited to people who had signed contracts with -- students, not just football players but everyone who else had signed enrollment contracts with the school? General brochure listing all the things you can do at the school including athletics, including -- you know, other extracurricular activities?                 Is that all right?

06-43 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 06-43, Stoneridge Investment Partners v. Scientific-Atlanta, et al. Mr. Grossman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY GROSSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       But it's not like under the Sherman Act, where we have reason to think Congress intended the Court to go about the business of construing and developing antitrust law.      In fact, they have kind of taken over for us.     They are imposing certain limits on when actions can be brought, proposing particular specific elements.     In one of the provisions, 20(e), specifying the SEC can bring an action but private investors can't. I mean, we don't get in this business of implying private rights of action any more.      And isn't the effort by Congress to legislate a good signal that they have kind of picked up the ball and they are running with it and we shouldn't?      Well, that's kind of my point.   We did that sort of thing in 1971.       We haven't done it for quite sometime.      I'm not -- my suggestion is not that we should go back and say that there is no private right of action.     My suggestion is that we should get out of the business of expanding it, because Congress has taken over and is legislating in the area in a way they weren't back when we implied the right of action under 10(b).      Is it -- is it a necessary part of your theory that the deceptive practice that Scientific-Atlanta went in, that they knew that that was also -- that Charter would carry that forward?   I mean, let's suppose that there were benefits to this deceptive practice to Scientific-Atlanta, that it looked like it had more money to spend on advertising than it really did, but they didn't care what Charter did with it.     In fact, they didn't know that Charter was going to carry it on its books the way they did.       Would there still be liability for Scientific-Atlanta?       Why shouldn't we be guided by what Congress did in reaction to the Central Bank case?    There we said there's no aiding-and-abetting liability, Congress amended the statute in 20(e) to say yes, there is, but private plaintiffs can't sue on that basis.   Why shouldn't that inform how we further develop the private action under 10b-5?      But they were -- they were addressing a very specific decision from this Court, the Central Bank decision.      And the one thing they did not do is say that that decision was wrong with respect to private -- or going forward they weren't going to overrule that decision with respect to private rights of action.    You're asking us to extend to non -- I know you call it a primary violator, but not the person who --      -- who put the deceptive conduct into the market.        You're asking us to extend that liability to them, which seems inconsistent with Congress's approach in 20(e).       But that's -- but that's not the fraud that was imposed upon the market. The fraud that was imposed on the market was Charter's accounting for the transaction on its books.     Nobody bought or sold stock in reliance upon the way that Scientific-Atlanta and Charter structured their deal. They did so in reliance on the way that Charter communicated its accounting to the marketplace.       Well, wouldn't it --        Mr. Grossman, I'm conscious of eating into your time but a question -- how many chains of this connection can you have?        Let's say Charter was not a publicly traded company, but same thing happened with respect to Scientific-Atlanta, and that made it look valuable to a company that is publicly traded.    So they decided to buy Charter and then that made their profits look better to investors.        Can you -- how many chains in the link can you go?       Thank you, Mr. Grossman.       Thank you, Mr. Hungar. Mr. Grossman, have you three minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY M. GROSSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL STERN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  Well, certainly that may be true, but it certainly relates to the service of a carrier.   I understood your argument to be that we can't read that language literally.                  It talks about what carriers have to do, so -- in connection with delivery, so it relates to the service of the motor carrier.                  It doesn't dictate what they have to do.      They can get out of the business.

06-5247 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument this morning in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler. Mr. Haltom. ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR S. HALTOM ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                    As I read the Court's opinion in Brecht, the Brecht standard on harmlessness is based on the structural consideration that your under collateral review at that point, rather than under direct review.          You would apply a different harmlessness standard that doesn't seem to take into account the fact that it's collateral review rather than direct.                    Well, I guess that's where maybe we -- is the subject of debate, whether the central theme in Brecht was, this is collateral review, and that calls for a different standard, or whether the central theme was Chapman review had been undertaken, and therefore, that calls for a different standard. I'm not sure I agree with you that the latter is the case.                  Page what?                  Thank you.                   Where is that in the question presented?                   You're now arguing that under Brecht this should not have been harmless; is that the point you're making?                   That wouldn't help us resolve the conflict in the circuits between which standard is applicable, though, right?                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Haltom, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR S. HALTOM ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                   Well, how strong is this witness, who didn't even know if it was a serious conversation, didn't hear the beginning of it, and didn't -- couldn't tell whether he was talking about something that happened 10 years before or 2 days before?
06-5306 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument next in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell. Mr. Mancino. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL MANCINO, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   But you knew that 14 days was the maximum because the motion asking for it cited and quoted from the rule.                   What if, what if the District Court gave you an extra month?                 Would your argument still be the same, that that -- because the court set it, that trumps the limitation in the rule?                     Why isn't -- this is just a notice of appeal.          Why would you -- why not file it the same day?    In terms of looking at it from some equitable sense, I don't understand why you wait toward the end of the period assuming you hadn't focused on the difference between the 14 days and the days allowed. What -- why, why would you delay filing the notice of appeal?                   Does it make -- does it a difference that we're dealing with the safety valve provision?   In other words, you've got the 30 days to file; and then this rule allows you to -- it's a safety valve, if you didn't get the notice or whatever, you've got a certain procedure that can give you the extra 14 days.   And now it seems to me that you're asking for a safety valve on top of a safety valve. And I wonder if there's some point where you cut off the -- allowing an out for missing the deadline.                   Well, but as soon as you start talking about an exception from the provision in the rules, then you're going to get a lot of applications and there are going to be a lot of different reasons for why it wasn't filed on the last day.   Once that -- it seems to me, you open it up for an indeterminate ruling.                   No, but Justice Kennedy's point I think is critical.                   In other words, the drafters of the rule obviously wanted to provide a safety valve.        But they also appreciated that you can't have it open-ended.             So they did impose limits on the -- if you want to call it equitable exception to the 30-day rule.   And it seems to me that you sort of restrike the balance the drafters of the rule struck if you allow further equitable departures from their, their rule.                  Would your -- would your proposed exception, does it work the other day?                    I mean, let's say the district court entered this order and set a date certain for you to file the notice of appeal, and only gave you seven days on his count rather than 14, and you filed it on the ninth day, in other words within the 14 days given under the rule. Would you be out of luck because of what the district court set out in its order as what's binding, as opposed to what the resume says?                       Or could you rely on the fact the rule says you get 14 days?                   Why wouldn't the same approach work the other way?                  The rule says 14 and the judge was wrong to give you more?                    All of that might have -- all those things might have been going on in the judge's mind, but you don't contest that the 14-day period was not complied with?             You don't have an argument that you complied with the 14-day period?                   One of the things I think the drafters of the rule wanted to assure is that there would be a point at which the prevailing party in the district court could know with certainty there wasn't going to be further proceedings in the case, and that's the purpose of the 180-day period and all that. It's not open-ended. Under your rule where the actual time for filing could be at some indefinite point, they'd never really quite have that assurance, would they?                   Well, what would be an unreasonable period of time if the two or three days is not?     Would another 10 days?                     You think we should have a rule of reason rather than a per se rule. (Laughter.)                   Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Mancino, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL MANCINO, JR., ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
06-531 +++$+++                     We'll next hear Case 06-531, Sole versus Wyner. Ms. Seitz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF VIRGINIA A. SEITZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   That's one of the things that concerns me.        I mean in many of these cases you have fairly elaborate proceedings over the preliminary injunction and the event takes place.               I would not want to get to a situation where people feel the need to artificially keep a case alive simply to ensure their entitlement to attorney's fees.               So how do you protect against that?                   So what do you do in a situation of mootness where there's -- you know, they'd be happy to pursue the claim to establish that they prevail on a permanent junction as well as a preliminary one, but the case has become moot.                   Are they automatically disentitled to attorneys' fees in that case?                   Well, there may be a pint to pursuing it but I'm not sure it's one that the locality governments -- I mean if you ask them the question, would you rather be liable for attorney's fees where you lose in a preliminary injunction but then the case becomes moot, or would you rather have to face individual officer liability to prevent the case from becoming moot?   Or would you rather face ongoing litigation to prevent the case from becoming moot because there's too much invested in the fees -- they might choose the former.                    Well, the plaintiffs decided to challenge it to the end.                     But I'm suggesting that if they know they might -- it might result in a loss of attorneys fees, when all they really wanted was a particular demonstration, others might pursue it differently.                     Thank you, Counsel. We'll hear from Ms. Millett.                   Ms. Millett. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT, ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONERS                     Is it -- can a preliminary injunction never be the basis for an award of attorney's fees?                  I have never understood why that's an issue.              Can't the parties -- it seems to me an exception that isn't consistent with the theory.   Why can't the parties just agree on attorney's fees in the settlement agreement and the consent decree and then it wouldn't have to be an issue?                   Ms. Millett, did I hear your legal test a while ago is an enduring change in the defendant's behavior?           Is that your standard?
06-5618 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument next in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States. Mr. Dwyer. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DWYER ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                   So one of the guides for reasonableness review is what's ordinary in a particular type of case?                   It's impossible to do in the abstract.       If you're just looking at a particular case, you have no idea whether 5 years is reasonable or not.      There has to be a background to it so that you know that in this type of case, people usually get a sentence of 3 years or they usually get a sentence of 10 years.        And it seems to me that what's ordinary is going to be a judge -- a driving fact in determining what's reasonable.                  Even if you're looking at not just the number, but the reasons.                In other words, the question I asked earlier, you've got nine district judges, they all say we do not depart downward for military service, and you've got one district judge that says we do.              It seems to me that if the court of appeals can't review that to bring about some uniformity in the factors that are appropriate to consider, then it's essentially a lawless system.                   On my particular case, what's the right answer for the court of appeals? They've got two cases before them.                 One, the judge departs three years because of military service.                    The prosecutor appeals.     The other, the judge refuses to depart because of military service and the defendant appeals. Should those -- what should happen with those two cases?                     That's got nothing to do with that case.        That's got something to do with a judgment apart from the particulars of the case about whether crack should be treated the same as powdered crack cocaine.     It's got nothing to do with the individual case.                   Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Dwyer, you have two minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DWYER, ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                   What about Mr. Dreeben's parting challenge?            What are you going to do if your client gets 10 years?             You're going to argue that's an extraordinary departure from the guidelines, right?
06-562 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-562, United States versus Atlantic Research Corporation. Mr. Hungar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    Well, but you --                    Well you've glided over the great difficulty which is it doesn't say that people identified in the statute shall be liable to other persons.    It says they will be liable to, under certain circumstances, the United States, a State or an Indian tribe and they are liable for -- for other costs incurred by any other person.              And it just seems that the most natural reading of that construction is that the other refers to other than the United States or a State or an Indian tribe.                  Well, how sure are you -- how sure are you that it doesn't protect them still?                  Well, when one responsible party has paid out the cost and is seeking a cost recovery claim from another responsible party, it's not too much of a stretch to call it a contribution claim, is it?                  You're not worried about any of that when you're dealing with an innocent party, the person you say can bring this action under 107(4)(b).   Don't all those same concerns and objections apply in that case as well?                  But you don't know, you don't know, that you're dealing with an innocent party until the end of the litigation.                  Do you have another example of an innocent party who can bring an action under 107(4)(b) other than a governmental subdivision?                   But they're somehow affected by the hazardous release.                   But they're still somehow affected by the hazardous release.                   But my point is that subsequent owner, EPA is going to start looking at him as a PRP, not as an innocent party.                    In other words, there is going to have to be an awful lot of litigation before he can establish that he is not a PRP and is instead an innocent, innocent party.                     Thank you, Mr. Geck. (Whereupon, at 10:57 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.) Mr. Hungar, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
06-571 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-571, Watson v. United States. Mr. Koch. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KARL J. KOCH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                      Well, I'm not sure. I have the same question as Justice Ginsburg.                      It seems to me, absent some precedents which narrows this definition, that that would have been the way to charge your client.    That's not what was charged; that's not the indictment; that's not what you're arguing.                      So I guess the question is more appropriate for the government. But, if, following Justice Ginsburg's question, this covers it, and it seems to me that it does, then we're not arguing about very much.                   Mr. Koch, let's say that the parties to the transaction are concerned about avoiding exposure under the money-laundering statute, and so they got together and said:                 All right, we are going to have this deal.         What can we use besides money? And they say:   Well, let's use guns, or let's use a gun. And the seller of the drugs says:                Okay.   I'm willing to use that. Isn't he using the gun in furtherance of the transaction?                    It's being actively employed as the consideration in the sale.                    It's not being shot, but it's still being employed.                    But I think it would be a natural, grammatical construction to say he's willing to use the gun for the consideration.                   Subsection (b) is not charged in the indictment?                   No.    But that was not charged in the indictment?                   Section 2(b)?                   Thank you, Ms. Maynard.    Mr. Koch, you have 4 minute remaining. REBUTTAL ARBUMENT BY KARL KOCH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

COCHRAN ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                      Does it matter what judge did in other cases?            I mean, if we look on the day before he said, well, the guidelines say this, but I think this case is different, so I'm going to depart, and the day after he says I know what the guidelines are, but I'm going to impose a higher sentence? I mean, how do we know he's -- when he says I looked at the guidelines and I think they're appropriate, that he's considering himself bound by something that he may or may not agree with, as opposed to what he said?   Which is, well, I cannot find that they're inappropriate?                    Counsel, what if there weren't guidelines at all, and the district court said maybe, you know, it's new, I want to see what other judges have done; he presses a button on the computer, give me what the sentences were looking at these facts, and finds out in the last 100 cases, this is what the sentence was.   And he says this seems to me no different than those and that's the sentence I'm going to impose. Is there any problem with that?                    Yes, well, he looks at all the individual factors and he says they seem not terribly different from these 100 other cases and the range in those 100 other cases was, you know, 5 to 7 years, and so I'm going to give him 5 years.                  How is that different than the -- how is that different than looking at the guidelines, which did that in a much more comprehensive way, and saying, I don't see anything different in this case from the normal guidelines case and so I'm going to impose that sentence?                   Thank you, Dreeben. Mr. Cochran, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS N. COCHRAN ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                    Mr. Cochran, you've started out by saying there were two places in the record that you thought showed the judge was bound by the guidelines.   49, what was the other one?                     Of the one -- oh, that point?    Okay.

06-637 +++$+++                   Counsel, do you agree that if we conclude the language is ambiguous, we should defer to the Secretary's interpretation in the comments accompanying the regulations?                  It just mirrors the statute --                  Well, then --                  Assuming we would think the statutory language is ambiguous, we are likely to think the same language in the regulation is ambiguous.                   Well, which -- which prevails, Chevron deference or spending clause presumption?                    -- run afoul of any of the other provisions.                  I think they may -- they may well have to stay longer than 10 days to either realize that the program is inadequate or to feel comfortable that they'll be able to establish that on the record.    It's pretty hard to say something's not working after only on 10 days.                  Oh, I don't think that's true, because the problem would be you would go to the hearing to see if you were getting the adequate education and you would have -- you would essentially have to make a facial challenge rather than an as-applied one, and the school would say, well, you didn't give us a chance; we were going to do this and we were going to do that.         So it would be a heavier burden to carry. The parents would have a heavier burden.   -- if they did --                     No, my suggestion is still that it would be easier to prevail at the impartial hearing, if you can say, look, we tried, it didn't work, as opposed to saying, we never even tried.                   If I were the impartial hearing examiner, I would think that that's a harder burden for the parents to carry if they didn't even try.   The school's going to come in and say, here's what we would have done if you'd given us a chance and you didn't give us a chance.                   Thank you, Mr. Garre.

06-6407 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument next in case 06-6407, Panetti versus Quarterman. Mr. Wiercioch. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY W. WIERCIOCH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Why can't you have sought leave to file a second or successive application and met the requirements, if you're right that the factual predicate for the Ford claim doesn't arise until the execution is imminent? Couldn't you have fit your claim under 2244(b)(2)(B), I guess, on that basis?                   And then we don't have to engage in the fiction that a second petition is actually not a second petition.                    I suppose it doesn't fit comfortably under there, but I guess the argument would be that -- guilty of -- we've used the concept of being guilty of the death sentence as opposed to guilty of the crime before, and the fact finder -- you wouldn't be sentenced to death if the sentencer had known you were incompetent.    I appreciate that it's not the most comfortable fit, but at least the part -- it seems to be addressed to the question of a factual predicate that's not present at the time of the first habeas petition. And that seems to be your justification for not filing it at that time.                   Right.   The point is that (b)(2)(B) is addressed to that precise situation where the facts aren't present when you file the first application.                   The constitutional violation won't occur until the execution?                   It's prospective, as you said?                   Could you maybe elaborate on that?      And mean if you have someone who is competent at the time they're convicted, competent at the time they're sentenced, and you say they're walking to the gurney to be executed, you know, they fall and hit their head and they don't understand it, it's somehow very cruel to go forward with the execution at that point, while it wouldn't have been before? I -- it seems to me, I mean, obviously competence at the trial and sentencing is important.                       I just don't understand the concept that it has to continue to the point of execution.                  Well does he understand why he's being imprisoned?                    I mean, does this, the Ford right extend to prison?                    Is it cruel to keep someone locked up for life when they don't understand why they're being locked up for life?                   No.   There's an element of retribution to imprisonment, just as there is to capital punishment.       Both deterrence and retribution in both instances, I would have thought.                   Thank you, counsel.                     Thank you, Mr. Cruz. Mr. Wiercioch, your rebuttal time was used up but not primarily by you.             If you want to take two minutes for rebuttal?

06-666 +++$+++                     We'll hear argument next in Case 06-666, Department of Revenue of Kentucky v. Davis. Mr. Trower. ORAL ARGUMENT of C. CHRISTOPHER TROWER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                  We have a different variation here that wasn't present in United Haulers, which, of course, is that Kentucky does compete with other public entities in the municipal bond market.                     In other words, I think you have a strong case with respect to discrimination against private bonds, but Kentucky competes against Ohio bonds as well.                     And they're making the Kentucky bonds more attractive through this discriminatory tax on the Ohio bonds. Why isn't that a sufficient distinction from United Haulers?                      Well, I suppose you could achieve the same result simply by providing you're not going to pay interest to somebody who is not a Kentucky resident.                   So we have to overrule Bacchus to agree with you? (Laughter.)                   Does your argument depend upon the uses to which Kentucky is putting these proceeds?                   Well, I thought it would because you're saying nobody else is responsible for public works in Kentucky and so on.                   No.   Just a public facility.                   So, if Kentucky had a law that it could only -- no out-of-State car dealer could sell cars in Kentucky, that benefited Kentucky car dealers, and then it had a special tax on Kentucky car dealers to fund local hospitals, airports, roads, whatever -- that would be all right?                   So it doesn't matter?     So the use to which the proceeds are put doesn't save an otherwise discriminatory activity?                    Thank you, Mr. Brunstad. Mr. Trower, you have 12 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF C. CHRISTOPHER TROWER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   Well, why do you care, Mr. Trower?     I mean, if you lose your tax exemption, it means you've got to pay more interest to sell your bonds, but it also means you're going to get taxes that you don't get now.               Isn't it kind of a wash? Does it really matter.                    Yes, but the State's going to have more money from their income taxes, and if they want to spend it on a project in a particular municipality, they will be free to do that.
06-6911 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument next in case 06-6911, Logan v. United States. Mr. Coad. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. COAD ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                    I understand that -- I understand that it is rare for misdemeanants to lose their civil rights.                    But certainly the minority approach.      In most States if you are convicted of a misdemeanor you do not lose civil rights?                  So your argument, if accepted, would essentially weed out, or at least for a majority of the States, weed out subdivision (a)(20)(A)(b) -- (a)(20)(B)?              In other words, there's coverage under the statute if you are convicted under a misdemeanor and you want to say, well, if your civil rights were never taken away, you shouldn't be covered. Well, that would mean most misdemeanors aren't going to be covered.                  Well, if I say most misdemeanors aren't going to be covered, it's not an answer to say, well, here's one State where they are covered.   It's maybe 49 are not.                     Isn't there another difficulty for you in this statutory comparison that Justice Souter has noted?          You're argument under (a)(20) is that it would be absurd for Congress to take people, exempt people, whose rights have been restored, but not people whose rights were never taken away.              That is exactly what Congress did in (a)(33). So if Congress thought it was all right even in albeit in a different context, it seems to me to be very difficult to argue that it is inherently absurd to do it somewhere else.                      You phrased Congress's intent as allowing an exemption for people the State has found trustworthy.                  But I don't think that's how this legislative process works. You have additional punishment, and then somebody says:      Oh, let's not apply it to people who are convicted of antitrust violations.                    And you say:      Yeah, yeah. And then somebody says:                        Let's not apply it to people whose civil rights have been restored.                        And they say:   Fine. And then nobody pipes up and says:                        Well, let's not apply it to people whose civil rights were never taken away. In other words, it's not an intent that is not effectuated.      It is just you want the intent to reach more broadly.                   So it's based on a congressional mistake, in other words, about the breadth, but it still doesn't --                  What about securities law violations?           (A)(20)(A)says this doesn't apply if it's an antitrust violation.                    Now, did Congress -- you could say:           Well, they would have applied it to securities law violations, too.                       It's a business offense.    They're not interested in that.                     So we should read this as applying to securities law violations.                  That kind of begs the question for you to say Congress is worried about offenders States think are trustworthy.                 What they actually said are, of course, offenders who have had their civil rights restored. Maybe if they focused on the question of whether or not civil rights were taken away in the first place, they would have made a different judgment, as they did, of course, in (a)(33).                  Well, isn't -- under our precedents, isn't what you just said fatal to your case:   In other words, Congress didn't think about this, or they made a mistake in thinking about it? In either case it's clear that they didn't legislate with respect to it.                   Thank you, Mr. Joseffer. Mr. Coad, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A.

06-694 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-694, United States v. Williams. General Clement.                  But if I could start with one of the more compelling hypotheticals on the other side.    Let's say I'm a movie reviewer.                  I write a review saying this is an awful movie.                    It portrays child pornography.    Aren't I presenting information in a way that would cause others to believe that the movie contains child pornography, and wouldn't that be covered by the statute?                    Well, that's a very different thing.   I read your brief the same way Justice Breyer did and particularly footnote 4 of the reply brief, which I understood to be giving "presents," for example in this statute, a promotional meaning in light of the other words around it, "advertises, promotes" and simply telling your -- you know, your neighbor, I got this, what should I do about it, isn't promotional.                 It may be in a technical term "presents," but it's not promotional. And, again, I understood your brief to suggest that you have to interpret all of those words in an advertising, soliciting sense.                   My understanding was not that it was limited to commercial speech.                     That was clear from the footnote that I cited.                  But that "presents" was limited to promotional activity.                    It's one thing to present and say either whether to law enforcement or your neighbor; it's another thing to promote the child pornography.             And I thought your brief was adopting a limited construction of words like "presents" that would cover only promotional activity.                   I'm sorry.   I lost -- in your answer, I lost a negative or something. Are you saying that this type of activity frequently occurs or infrequently occurs?                  Thank you, Mr. Diaz. General Clement, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Washington State Republican Party et al. General MCKenna. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. MCKENNA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   Can you give us assurance that they will not?             I take it we don't -- we haven't had an election under this system, so we don't know what the ballots are going to look like.                  Are you telling us that that's what the ballots are going to look like?                  There just hasn't been an election under this, under this law, right?                   Nobody is voting for Mr. Dale perhaps on the misimpression that he is affiliated with the Boy Scouts, and that's what undermines the Boy Scouts' associational rights.                   People are going to think he's associated with the Boy Scouts even though they may want to disassociate themselves with him.                   Do you agree that if it were that way, in other words if the ballot looked like the ballot on page 1 of the Grange reply brief, that that would be unconstitutional?                   Do these preference statements continue under the general election?                   Can you change between the primary and the general election?                  Can you say my preferred party is the Republican Party, so you get more Republican votes to get you over the hump so you are one of the two, and then in the general election say, my preference is the Democratic Party, because there are more Democratic voters?                   You're saying -- your argument is that they have a First Amendment right to put their preference on the ballot, but somehow when the general election comes along that First Amendment right evaporates.                      They're not allowed to split the ballot in their preference, are they, say I prefer one party on domestic issues, I prefer the other party's position on foreign affairs?                   But clearly, it's just like a trademark case.            I mean, they're claiming their people are going to be confused.                  They are going to think this person is affiliated with the Democratic or Republican Party when they may, in fact, not be at all.                     I didn't suggest it would be a trademark violation.               I think I said it was just like the same analysis.             And I don't know why you would give greater protection to the makers of products than you give to people in the political process.                  Thank you, Mr. White. General MCKenna, you have 4 minutes relating. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT MCKENNA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.                  Maybe I'm wrong.   I thought you did say it would be unconstitutional.                  And could you --                  I mean how would you defend that?    I mean --                  Well, we are assuming it is applied in the way that is shown on the Grange reply brief at page 1.              If it were applied in that way, would that be unconstitutional?                  It just says R or D.                    If the state has no legitimate interest it's going to fail any level of scrutiny.
06-7517 +++$+++                  We'll hear argument next in Case 06-7517, Irizarry versus United States. Mr. Madden. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR J. MADDEN, III ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                   You may not have had notice of the issue of whether or not an alternative procedure and medication audit would help, but you certainly knew that future dangerousness was going to be on the table.    And if you had a response to that, which is, well, if he took his medication, it wouldn't be a problem, I assume you would have prepared for that.                   Well, yeah, I -- but in terms of what issues might suggest themselves to a judge sentencing this particularly defendant, I would have thought future dangerousness.                  I mean, you have an individual who has leveled particular threats with some degree of certainty that he intends to pursue them, I would have thought that would have been one of the first things a sentencing judge would look at.                  Does the defendant have an obligation to give notice, both to the government and I suppose to the judge, saying at the -- at the sentencing hearing, we're going to say this?                  So the judge can get ready for it?                Or the government can get ready for it?                   What about the point made by Chief Judge Boudin in his recent opinion, is that now that we look more carefully at the 3553 factors, counsel has to come in prepared to address all of those?

My understanding, of course, is that that simply elects -- it doesn't get you on the ballot.                  It elects delegates who then exercise the choice.

GREEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Well, I'm sure that's not always true.       I mean, if the leader of some vast conspiracy is the one who blows the whistle, I suspect he may well be charged anyway.                    Well then, what's left of the appellate review?              I mean, under your theory is there any substantive review for the appellate court or is it all just procedural under -- putting aside your logical coherence point, which --                    In a typical abuse of discretion review, you still have -- for example, if you have a judge in -- well, let's say you have a judge; in one case he says because this is a -- a young defendant, I'm going to give him a lighter sentence; and in the next case says, you know, I don't think age is a factor that I should consider in the case; in the next case he says it is and then not.                Each -- all of those cases, I take it, are upheld under your view on appellate review.                    So there can be substantive review for consideration of age?                   Okay, so at the same time --                   But if you have two district judges in the same courthouse and the one says, when I have a young defendant I always -- I forget whether the term is "vary" or "depart" -- but I always go down, and the next judge says, I never consider age. Those -- both of those are upheld under your view, I take it?                    Isn't that exactly --                    Isn't that exactly what the Sentencing Commission did in establishing the Guidelines?                    Mr. Green, I understood you to respond to Justice Souter's question that courts of appeals could consider a broader range of cases in deciding whether it's an abuse of discretion in a particular case.                    Now, if they can consider a broader range of cases, what's so bad about suggesting that if a particular case is way out of what their broad review shows, if the broad review shows that in most cases this type of defendant gets 5 years and in this particular case, the judge gave him 30 years or gave him zero, what's wrong with suggesting that that is a factor they should at least start with in saying something's unusual about this case, we ought to take closer look?                   Well then, what's the point of looking at the broad range of cases if they can't do anything about it?                   So is it right to say if the broad range shows that most of these defendants get a sentence of 10 years in jail and in this case the person got probation, that the court should look for some reasons to explain what the difference, to justify the difference?                    We'll give you rebuttal time, Mr. Green, but I just have one question. I think we've gotten off the track a little bit.    The question presented is about the extraordinary circumstances test and proportionality review.                   We've been talking a lot about what district court judges can do.    What's wrong with, whatever you want to call it, saying if something is out of the norm, you ought to have some good reason for being out of the norm?                    That's the only question presented in this case.                  Thank you, Mr. Green.                   Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Green, you have a minute remaining.

06-8120 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument next in 06-8120, Brendlin versus California. Ms. Campbell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH M. CAMPBELL, ESQ. ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                     Well, it wouldn't apply in a taxicab, right?           I mean, the cab is driving erratically, the officer pulls it over.                  If I'm a passenger in the cab, I think I can get out and catch another cab, right?                   But you would have no reason if you were a passenger on a bus in the normal case to assume that the officer was concerned about you. Your view would not be that they are stopping me, you'd think they're stopping the bus because the driver ran a red light or whatever.                  But you would state he is still seized because the car is stopped.                    Well, does that make a difference?   Let's say, you know, the car drives through a red light and the police lights come on.                        The passenger surmises that it's because they ran a red light.   So that's a different case?                     You would say it's not seized if he reasonably, objectively, reasonably assumes it's because of what the driver did.                    So then why are we pointing out that they didn't know?                      It makes no difference under your view of the case.                  Well then, if all that matters is the physical stop, what do you do about the cases that were talked about earlier where the other cars have to stop because of the way -- that's a physical stop and yet our cases indicate you're not seized in those situations.                    Thank you Counsel. Miss Campbell, you have five minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH M. CAMPBELL, ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                    So that -- so that, still then, it's just begging the question of whether or not his Fourth Amendment rights were violated.                    You're making a good case that the driver's Fourth Amendment rights were violated, but why isn't the passenger, as your friend said, just in the unlucky circumstance to have been in a car whose the driver's Fourth Amendment rights were violated?                  The California Supreme Court didn't have to reach that issue because it found there was no seizure.
06-8273 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument first this morning in Danforth v. Minnesota. Mr. Butler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. BUTLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                     Well, Federal rules don't have minimums and maximums.                  They have a rule. And as Justice Kennedy pointed out, you can have a State rule under the State constitution that goes further.                       It seems to me that the States' determination to apply Crawford retroactively must be based on a disagreement with this Court's Teague analysis, which refers back to the substantive elements of Crawford.                     So, in other words, the disagreement at bottom is a disagreement about how to read the substantive requirements of Crawford.                   Well, how do you -- I understand your point.           Teague has both elements to it.     But if you're applying Teague, there are certain exceptions that are based on exactly what the underlying right is, what the Crawford right is.                     Is it a watershed rule?     Is it something else?           And the court makes a determination as a matter of Federal law on those points.     And what you're arguing for is discretion in the State to disagree with those substantive determinations.                      Can a State -- can they pick -- can a State pick and choose?                   Can it say that we are going to allow Crawford claims to be applied retroactively, but other claims, we're not going to?                      Well, and if you think that the Teague rule is an assessment of the substantive -- part of the substantive constitutional interpretation, an assessment about what the impact of Crawford is versus other decisions, then I guess they couldn't, right?                  Based on the distinction between right and remedy, a distinction that is -- that in countless areas of the law we -- we have said is -- is an ephemeral one?                    Does your -- does your approach apply to legislative enactment's as well? Let's say Congress passes a law and it provides as particular remedy, and it says this remedy shall not be retroactive but only apply in new cases. Can the State say well, we think it ought to apply to old cases, pending cases on habeas, or whatever, and so we are going to apply this retroactively, even though Congress said it's only prospective?                  No, no.   They just say here's a new remedy, maybe a glance and exclusionary remedy in cases where we have held one isn't required -- can the State allow that retroactively, even though Congress -- a Federal remedy, even though Congress has said this Federal remedy is only prospective?                  Well, your reliance on this ancient distinction between right and remedy -- I mean if Congress says you don't have a remedy if it's retroactive, it's hard to say what kind of right you have.                   Sure, as a matter of State law.                   But here you are arguing in favor of retro-application of Federal law. There is no issue -- as Justice Kennedy pointed out, you can have a State confrontation clause and do whatever you want with it.    But you are relying on the Federal provision.                   No.   No.   I would have thought the very least Teague is, is Federal common lawful.     In other words, this is the Federal law of remedies.     I think it is more than that.                 I think it is substantive constitutional -- substantive Federal constitutional law.       But it's at least Federal common law, and doesn't Federal common law preempt State common law.                   -- it is the other way around which makes it problematic.                   You are going to say the remedy is retroactive even if there's no right. You're going to say where we have decided that there is no remedy and, therefore, if you have a right, it's -- I don't know what you get out of it -- you want to say, no, there is a remedy.                   So you have to argue, and this is why I think the distinction has been rejected in so many other areas of the law, you have to argue that the remedy question is totally separate from an analysis of the right.            Because otherwise, you are saying the State courts have the right to disagree with our determination of what the Federal right is.                   If you think the remedy, the question of remedy draws some substance from what the right is, which I would have thought is obviously the case, then it seems to me you're asserting a power on the basis of the State court to overturn our Federal law determinations.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                  So that if you're the CEO of your company, and a lawyer -- Federal counsel comes in and says we've got a real issue under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I need to brief you on that, we need to make an important decision about whether we are complying, you say I don't want to hear about it, I don't want to know about it.            That would not be willfully violating the statute?                  So it doesn't have to be actual knowledge?                   Well, just because an issue is one of first impression doesn't mean there's a high degree of uncertainty.               The statute may be clearly addressed to that issue.                 It hasn't come up before.                   First impression.                   Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Millett. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT, ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   Correct me if I'm wrong.    You think if I have an insurance policy, I'm paying a certain rate, they look at my credit report and they say, you know, good news, we're going to lower your rates, that's an adverse action because they might have lowered the rates even further if they had notified me about the credit report and there were some errors in it?                   Right.                   So if they lower, if they lower the rates, you still say that that fits the meaning of adverse action because they might have lowered them further if the information hadn't been erroneous?                  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Mahoney, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
06-856 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument this morning in case 06-856, LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg & Associates. Mr. Stris. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    But the plan itself is nowhere in the record, is that right?                    Right, the summary. And I looked at the summary and saw nowhere the rules about investment options, what you get to choose, how often -- and for all we know, the plan might say you have no choice about investment options, it's all going to be invested in T-bills or whatever.                  Where in the record is it?                  No, that's in the opposition to certiorari, and I don't believe that's in the record.                  Oh, that's the summary of the plan.                  The summary on the page you mentioned says that you will be able to -- you have certain investment choices are available to you, and that the administrator will provide you with information on what they are and how you can change it.                  But we don't know those details, correct?                  It would also presumably more obviously constitute a breach of the plan, correct?                  Your position is anything that is remediable, if that's a word, under (a)(1) can also be pursued under (a)(2)?                  Let me step back. Do you agree that you could bring an action under (a)(1) for this breach of the plan?                   Your approach, if can you go under (a)(2) -- you're right that we judicially have developed a number of glosses on (a)(1), including I think most importantly the Firestone deference principle.     But if you're right that you can go under (a)(2), then all of that work has been in vain. You can avoid all the limitations on (a)(1) just by saying we want the same relief under (a)(2).                   You told me earlier that any breach of the plan was a fiduciary duty.                   Now you're -- the -- what is it -- the obverse or the converse of that you're saying is not true.                   I -- I'm not sure about your characterization that he would pick the pockets of the other plan participants.                 By definition he only prevails if this was a benefit to which he was entitled under the plan.        So that doesn't seem unfair to the other plan participants.                    Well, it may or may not have the money.     You could have failed to follow his instructions in a way that enriched the plan, and it's simply a question of getting that money properly allocated rather than improperly allocated to the other plan participants who are picking the pocket of your client.                   Thank you, Mr. Stris. Mr. Roberts. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER                   But that means every participant, right?      In other words, for the failure of the plan to follow this individual's instructions, any participant in the plan can bring suit under (a)(2)?                      How do we know that this is a breach of fiduciary duty under (a)(2) without having the plan before us?            In other words, it may not be a fiduciary obligation to follow an instruction from somebody if the plan provides a different way in which those instructions are going to be handled. I'd say, as I think a lot of these plans do, you can change your investment options only during a particular period.      Well, if the instruction came at a different time, it wouldn't be a breach of fiduciary duties because it wasn't a breach of the plan.                   But I thought his argument -- his argument reduces to the fact that it's a breach of fiduciary duty because it's a breach of the plan.     But if not a breach of the plan, then it's not a breach --                   So we need to know -- we need to know what the plan provides before we can decide.                   The pleadings don't include the plan.     So we have to assess the pleadings without the terms of the plan.                   But we don't know under what terms.    I mean I've seen plans where you are entitled to direct, but that's subject to conditions and limitations.                   Do you agree that if it is within (a)(1)(B) that it's therefore not within (a)(2)?                   Well, I thought your answer would be yes.        In other words, if it's in (a)(1), it's not in (a)(2).                    You can finish your sentence.
06-9130 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument next in case 069130 Ali versus Federal Bureau of Prisons. Mr. Andre.                   I suppose there is a difference between a sufficient laundry list in a residual phrase and example in a residual phrase.                  In Circuit City you have a couple of examples -- seamen, railroad workers -- here it's just a customs or excise worker.   I regard customs and excise as kind of the same thing.    So why isn't it more like the cases where we've said you have an example in a residual phrase; the example is not limiting.                    Well, not just goods or merchandise.   Goods, merchandise or other property. And does other property include any type of property?                    So "goods and merchandise or other property" are just examples, and then a residual phrase that includes everything; but "customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer," that's subject to ejusdem generis - all in the same sentence.                     But, I mean that's always true when you have an example and a more general phrase.   And yet our cases indicate that we often read the language that way. In other words, it's giving you, perhaps, the most common example in which you're going to have a detention of goods, but it's not limiting it to those officers.                   Yes, but S.D. Marine wouldn't have come out the other way.                   Was that an obscure statute in S.D. Marine?                  Doesn't the word, as your brother argues, doesn't "any" cut against you?                  If they intended the other law enforcement officer to be limited to similar to customs or excise, it seems to me they wouldn't have thrown in "any other law enforcement officer."                   But the President doesn't rely on those when he signs the statute into law.                    Thank you, Mr. Shanmugam. Mr. Andre, you have four minutes remaining.

06-923 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-923, Metropolitan Life Insurance versus Glenn. Miss Posner. ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY K. POSNER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   How does that work? I don't understand.      You go through, you've got a decision, whatever, it's a health insurance decision that this procedure -- to determine that this procedure is not covered under the, the plan, that the fiduciary has the discretion to make that determination.                 But you say, aha, he's got a conflict of interest, so that's a factor we take into account.             Well, how does -- what does that mean?                   All right, you've got two cases, one where the person does not have a conflict of interest under a particular plan, the other where he does.    It's the same decision:                We're not going to cover this procedure.          How is the review different in each of those cases as a practical matter?                  I guess I don't see an answer to my question yet.            How does the review differ as a functional matter?             He says he looks at it and says, well, normally that would be within the discretion, but I've got to remember he's got a conflict, so I'm going to determine that this particular procedure should be covered because of the conflict.                  Counsel, Justice Souter's question and Justice Alito's question highlight for me what I think is the central issue.               Justice Souter had asked you whether the conflict comes into play, you know, when it's a tie.              And you're right on the fence, and you say, well, the conflict's a factor, so it tips over in the employee's favor. Justice Alito's question asked you whether or not the conflict has to play a role in the decision. I don't know how that would be, but let's say, for example, the insurance company is doing well and so they say, well, we allow coverage for this procedure.               All of a sudden, the insurance company looks like it's not doing so well, it's not going to meet the quarterly targets or whatever, so it says, well, we're no longer going to allow coverage for that procedure.               In other words, it is the conflict itself that affects which way it comes out. Now, which is right:              Justice Souter's case in which the conflict tips the scales, no matter what the reason is; or Justice Alito's case where the conflict plays a role in the decision process?                  Thank you, counsel.                    Miss Posner, you have one minute remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AMY K. POSNER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                  Thank you, counsel.

06-937 +++$+++                       We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-937, Quanta Computer v. LG Electronics. Ms. Mahoney. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   Well, if that's true then this case really isn't a big deal at all.                    It just depends on exactly how you word the contract when the patentee sells it to a purchaser.                You can word it -- in other words, you can word it in such a way that the patentee's rights extend further downstream and you're saying all this case turns on is whether the wording here was correct or not.                   Well, I understand your position to -- to acknowledge that they could have structured the sale to Intel in such a way as to achieve the same result that you're saying is so bad under the patent laws.                   So the parties are unwilling to spell out exactly how this is going to work out in their contract, and each side, it prefers to take their chances on how the Federal Circuit's going to rule.   It's easier to sell these things if they're not encumbered by these additional license requirements and the manufacturer presumably gets a lot more, but there's a lot of uncertainty, uncertainty that could have been cured by how the contract was drafted, and people prefer to live with that uncertainty and litigate rather than clear it up in the contract.                   Fine, and the person who wrote that provision knows that the question of how the patent-exhaustion doctrine applies is the subject of great confusion, so much confusion that the Supreme Court's going to have to decide it, and yet they put that in there rather than spelling out in the contract exactly which they had in mind, whether or not you could impose these further restrictions or couldn't.                   Well, it wasn't clear to the Federal Circuit, I guess.                     Thank you, Ms. Mahoney. Mr. Hungar? ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS                   Although you think it can be overridden simply by providing in the contract that the same rights and remedies would be available?                   A mere license can prevent the application of the patent-exhaustion doctrine?                   And it would be patent infringement by the use of the product by the people that Intel sold to?                   That would sound like your friend on the other side, the Respondent, had actually won in this case.                  Well, I think that's an important question.        I understood the argument at page 16 of your brief to say that the patent-exhaustion doctrine doesn't apply in that situation and that you, therefore, can't have the rights and remedies under patent law. You told me earlier that if the person to whom Intel sells the product uses it contrary to the license stipulation, they would be liable for patent infringement. Your answer to Justice Breyer suggests to me that you're saying only that they're liable to -- for contract infringement, and that's a very big difference.                  Sale from whom to whom?                   But what you -- well, but what you say in your brief is that in the situation we're talking about the licensee stands in the shoes of the patentee.      Now, if that's right it seems to me that you're telling me that the patent remedies are available and not simply contractual remedies.                   Well --                   Well, or, more pertinently, it can only sell if the person they sell to agrees not to use the product in a certain way.                    Exactly.    That's the critical point.   You're telling me that if the buyer, in other words, the kind of third person in this chain, uses the patented article in a way that is contrary to the license that was given to the second person in the chain, then he is liable for contributory infringement under the patent laws and not, as I understood you to answer to Justice Breyer, only under contract law.                    Do you sue under patent law or just contract law?                  Thank you, Mr. Phillips.   Ms. Mahoney, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E.

Well, they can do business with other entities beside the State.                     Thank you, counsel. You've got a friend on the other side still.                     Mr. Hungar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS                     What about the spending clause question?           You -- the Federal Government has a lot of programs where they use their own money and they come with a lot of conditions, and you -- your office frequently argues that those are justified under the spending clause.       Why isn't what California is doing here similarly justified?                     How do we tell whether they are using their spending power to regulate as opposed to simply attaching conditions to what's done with State funds?                  On a case like Rust versus Sullivan, is the Federal Government acting to promote policy, or is it simply acting in a proprietary capacity?                  I'm talking about spending power versus regulatory power in general.                   Well, give me an example of a spending clause provision that would be acceptable, not necessarily in this context, but in general, because you would say, well, that's not trying to implement a policy at all.                  Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Goldsmith, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIS J. GOLDSMITH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                    What about the Lyng case that Mr. Gottesman cited in response to that argument?                    Well, Lyng said that the -- that Congress was being neutral not that it was making a choice on how to spend its funds.                 And I understood Mr. Gottesman's point to be that so too, here, California is being neutral.

General Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION                  How are we supposed to decide whether this case -- if you think it's important to our resolution, how are we supposed to decide whether this particular case is typical or not?                  I think it's very hard to determine.      Therefore, I think it's hard to determine in the abstract whether its inconsistent with the conclusion in MCConnell that a vast majority of the cases would not be covered or if it's inconsistent with it.                      That gets back to my same question:   How do we know that this is or is not outside the mainstream.          We have just the three ads that are at issue here.      It's not as if we have a survey of all the ads that are run during the blackout periods in particular election cycles.               How do we tell whether this is within the mainstream or not?                    Counsel, the Court in MCConnell used the term, as you've used it this morning, "vast majority."          What is that?         Is 70 percent a vast majority, so that 30 percent of the ads are going to be outside of that and would be candidates for this as-applied challenge?                   You're suggesting the district court decision is not consistent with MCConnell.   But it seems that your approach today is inconsistent with our decision last year that you can have as-applied challenges.             You're suggesting that if we allow this as-applied challenge to go forward that we have to facially strike down the section.                   So tell me what one, an ad that would succeed in an as-applied challenge looks like, or what the standard would be that we would apply in a way that you think would not call into question the decision in MCConnell about Section 203?                   What you're saying, though, is if this as-applied challenge succeeds you're saying the only way we can do that is if we think that the statute is facially unconstitutional.                 I'm just trying to see if there's a way of --                   -- approaching this as-applied challenge in a way that doesn't require us to revisit that prior --                  Can I, can I understand you to suggest we ought to draw a distinction in as-applied challenges between a 501(c)(3) organization and a corporation?                  That is not a 501(3)(3) corporation?                     Thank you, General Clement. Mr. Waxman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN, ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN, ET AL.

Just because the ACLU doesn't do that doesn't seem particularly pertinent to me.                  Please.                   Thank you, Mr. Bopp. General Clement, you have two minutes remaining.

06-984 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument this morning in Case 06-984, Medellin v. Texas. Mr. Donovan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD F. DONOVAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                     Who would enforce those constraints?      The thing that concerns me about your position is that it seems to leave no role for this Court in interpreting treaties as a matter of Federal law. Suppose, for example, that the International Court of Justice determined in this case its judgment was the same, but they added:               As a matter of deterrence, we think the officers who failed to give consular warning should each be sentenced to 5 years in jail.   That's the ICJ determination.                     Would this Court have a role in reviewing that judgment?                   Even if we determine --                   Even if we determine, even if we determine that that judgment is based on a legal error?                   So if the ICJ determined that the officers should each go to jail for 5 years, we would have no basis for reviewing that judgment?                  I'm sorry.    I'm still looking for an answer to the hypothetical.                    What would be the basis for this Court's reviewing the ICJ's determination that officers should go to jail for 5 years?                  The Court doesn't have executive power.       It has judicial power.               It's already exercised that judicial power in Sanchez-Llamas in determing the meaning of this treaty. And I understood your position to be that we have no authority to construe the treaty in this case because a judgment was issued by the International Court of Justice.                     Now --                     Just to get back, you're conceding, I take it, whether the ICJ has done something like this before or not -- and we can debate whether what they've done in this case is precisely that -- there is a role for this Court in determining whether or not a judgment of the ICJ should be enforced.                     Just enforcing the obligation to comply or, as we have in this case, determining the legal basis for the ICJ determination?                   Is the answer to --                   Is the answer to either my or Justice Stevens's hypothetical then, yes, we do have to enforce an ICJ judgment of that sort?   But --                    Well, why don't -- why don't you take 5 extra minutes?                      And we'll give you your rebuttal time. If the Avena judgment is binding as Federal law, is it your position, though, that the -- this Court has no authority to review the content of that Federal law -- the judgment?      Our choice is simply enforce it?                   So we have no --                   We have no authority to review the judgment itself, even though the judgment will have the effect as Federal law of preempting the State law in this instance?                   Excuse me, but your position is not that we are applying the obligation to comply, because we interpreted that in Sanchez-Llamas and came to the exact same conclusion as the ICG here. What you're saying is it's different here because the operative law is the judgment.                     So if he determines that the judgment should not be enforced and this Court determines, based on our construction of the treaty and the judgment that it should be enforced, which determination controls?                     Well, if we have the authority to determine whether the treaty should be complied with in the face of a presidential determination, why don't we have the independent authority to determine whether or not it should be complied with at a matter of Federal law without regard to the President's determination?                   Thank you, Mr. Donovan.     We'll give you 5 minutes for your rebuttal. General Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT. ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER                  What if the President had said, we're going to comply with this judgment, but in a different way than the ICJ determined.    We're going to comply by examining in each case whether there's already been a determination of prejudice, and if there has then there's no further review, but if there hasn't then there'll be further review.   Would that be binding as a matter of Federal law?                     It's the same as a memorandum just like -- it's a memorandum just like the one we have here.   It says that if there has already been -- the State courts are to determine if there's already been a determination of prejudice in the case, and if there has there's to be no further review. But if they determine there hasn't, there is to be further review.   That's different than the ICJ's judgment, which suggests there should be a new determination in every case. Is that -- does that have the same status as the memorandum here?                    But he can -- he can take action that's inconsistent with the determination of Federal law by this Court?                    I thought we determined in Sanchez-Llamas that the treaty did not mean what the ICJ said it means in this case.                   Do you doubt that the judgment here is based on a determination of the Vienna Convention that's exactly the opposite of what we determined last year?                   Yes.                      In none of those cases were we talking about a determination contrary to a legal determination by this Court concerning the scope of powers under the treaty.                     Thank you, Mr. Cruz. Mr. Donovan, you have five minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DONALD F. DONOVAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  I read the Comegys case, however you say it, to be for the exact opposite proposition.    There they were saying, this is an international arbitration, there's no reason to go behind it. But the question of whether or not that arbitration is binding in the bankruptcy proceeding that was at issue there was very much one for the U.S. Supreme Court to make.                  What is the authority -- I get back to where I started.                  I understood you to concede that we would have authority to construe the judgment if it provided, for example, for a punitive sanction against the officers.                     What is the basis under your theory for that authority?                  But it can -- it can contravene our interpretation of the treaty as a matter of Federal law.                   Do we have the authority to interpret the judgment of the ICJ?                   So we have the authority to interpret it, we have the authority to construe whether it's carry to the Constitution, but we do not the authority to consider whether it's consistent with Federal law?                  Thank you, Mr. Donovan.
06-989 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-989, Hall Street Associates v. Mattel, Inc. Mr. Phillips. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Mr. Phillips --                   Mr. Phillips, why do you care?   If this is not enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, which gives you kind of a shortcut -- the district court must confirm it if certain criteria are met -- I assume you have a normally enforceable contract that the district court can enforce just like it enforces any other contract.                   So you should lose.                   So you should lose.                   No.   We should conclude that you don't fall within the Federal Arbitration Act and it's not a big deal because you can bring -- you can have the contract enforced.                  The district court as far as I can tell wants to enforce this agreement, presumably will enforce it as a contract.   So you don't need the Federal Arbitration Act, so why should we fly in the face of its plain language to accommodate your interests?                     Is there a basis -- well, the Federal Arbitration Act doesn't provide jurisdiction anyway.        So I assume you have a basis for being in Federal court --                     -- in the first place.   So you're just enforcing a contract in diversity in Federal court.                     No, you're asking us to bring it under the Federal Arbitration Act and say that the district court must confirm it despite the fact that you've changed the standards under Section 9 to 11.                   Right.                   But my point --                   My point is that if you have an ordinary contract action the district court will, because your contract provides a particular standard of review, enforce that.                Right?                   But they have in fact.    On page 43 of their brief, they say that if you prevail the parties would be left to a State law contract action to determine the enforceability of the award.                      No, no.    I --                      No.   Their citation is to an arbitration treatise.                The contract they're referring to is the contract to arbitrate.                     And, unless I'm mistaken, what you want is for the district court to be able to enforce your agreement under the Federal Arbitration Act.     Right?                      Well, it doesn't fall squarely within it because the Federal Arbitration Act sets different standards of review.                    And all I'm saying is I don't see what the big deal is because you -- okay, don't use the Federal Arbitration Act, which gives you kind of an express remedy the district court must confirm.     Use normal contract law and say to the district court:     Well, you don't have the Federal Arbitration Act, you don't have to confirm it as a judgment, but we have a contract, it's perfectly valid, it sets a different standard of review, you should enforce it.                   The arbitration provision, the arbitration agreement is just a contract. Right?                   Well, then I don't understand why it's not enforceable as a contract.                   Well, if it's enforceable -- I'm obviously missing something here.                  If it's enforceable as a contract, what is the great benefit you get out of prevailing and saying this should be enforced under the Federal Arbitration Act?                    What do you do if you have a contract, an arbitration agreement that's not covered by Section 2, it's not concerning a maritime transaction or involving commerce?                    Okay.                   Why in the -- why is that the case?     I mean, this doesn't purport to occupy the field of arbitration and to preempt State law.                    It provides that a very direct order -- the district court must confirm the arbitration award as a judgment --                   -- if you fall within the criteria.        And all I'm saying is they'll say, okay, I don't have to confirm it as a judgment.                   Oh, no.   You're in Section 2, I agree --                   I agree that you're in Section 2, and the State court can't invalidate your agreement under some special rule that applies only to arbitration.    But you want to be under Section 9, and that says --                   -- that the district court must confirm the arbitration award if it meets certain standards.                   But the only basis --                   The only basis you have for getting them to correct the award is a different standard of review than the one provided in Section 10.

GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   You don't -- you don't dispute that, whatever the policy was, that it was approved and condoned by the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI?                  Well, it may -- it may very well be, but isn't it, for purposes of a complaint, sufficient to raise a due process claim by saying what they say?     In other words, you -- you may have a very good defense to it.             You may have something that does not ever get beyond -- get them beyond the point of summary judgment.         But for them simply to charge that there was a policy in which they picked up people and they held them until they were cleared, i.e., sort of demonstrated to be innocent in some way, that at least on the face of it seems to -- to state a due process problem under the Fifth Amendment, doesn't it?                    That -- that sounds like an argument on the merits of the Bivens claim, rather than an argument going to qualified immunity.                   Reading the Riot --                   Reading the Riot Act to the lawyer is protection against the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI after they're hauled in for discovery or subjected to depositions and the judge finds out --                  I'm sorry, Mr. Garre. -- the judge finds out that there wasn't in fact a sufficient basis for it, and that -- that will show them, if they get read the Riot Act by a judge?

07-10374 +++$+++                      We will hear argument next in Case 07-10374, Haywood v. Drown. Mr. Murtagh. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JASON E. MURTAGH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  Well, except in -- they said except in cases where the guards are acting outside the scope of their employment.                  I guess there's a difference.    I mean, obviously Felder is significant help to you.    But I suppose it's a difference to say they've redefined the cause of action under Federal law and said they are just not going to hear it at all.                 It may seem paradoxical, but the latter may be from a constitutional point of view the sounder characterization, because it's obviously not the responsibility or the authority of States to say, well, this is how the Federal law is going to be applied. But it might be their -- their -- within their authority to say, look, this is what our State court system provides and if you don't like it for a Federal claim, you have always got the Federal courts.                    Yeah, but `they are not really or at least you can view it as they are not discriminating against the Federal cause of action, because they don't allow the State cause of action of the sort you want to pursue either.                    Well, that's -- that's true.   And Howlett does say that.                  But as we've pointed out on many occasions, "jurisdiction" is a term that covers a lot of different things.                   And at some point something starts to look jurisdictional, which is, look, we're not going to hear your case at all.                   In other areas, even if they call it jurisdictional, it really doesn't seem that way, such as, well, you've got to give this much notice or you've got to -- you know, maybe those things aren't really jurisdictional.                   But saying you can't bring the case at all strikes me as really jurisdictional.                   So if this were at the beginning of whenever New York was establishing a court system, and they said from the outset, look, we are not going to hear these types of cases, then this would be okay?                   No, no, that's mixing the two points.      Your point I understand it --   -- is that once the court has opened it up to a particular type of claim, they can't say, say no more.           So if they are setting up -- obviously we are not going to go back to whenever the New York State courts was established.                But if they suddenly said, we are going to revise our court system or - or modernize it, and from now on we are not going to do this?                   So it's done exactly what the Federal system has done.                So that if you have a money claim against -- that is going to be against the Federal Government, here's what you do:                    You go to the Court of Claims, you have to go to the Court of Claims; and in that court all sorts of special rules apply about notice and other things.                      Well, but in the Federal system if you sue a Federal official or a postman and in fact in reality it's going to be a claim against the United States, that has to go to the Court of Claims, too.                    I guess my point is that there's nothing fishy about what New York has done here.   Which leads me to think, well, maybe it's not really discrimination against the Federal claim, it's a rational way to handle claims against the State treasury, just as the Federal system is a rational way to handle claims against the Federal treasury.                    Well, that just goes back to our previous colloquy about what jurisdiction is and what it means.      I mean, are you saying that if we look at this and we decide yes, this does really look like jurisdiction in the real sense, rather than just a jurisdictional label -- if we do that, then you lose?

In other words, if the judge says, look, I don't want to hear about all this other stuff, it's just too long, he can't do that beyond the six hours, but he can within the six hours.

Well, but that -- that sort of flagrant conduct would not be an issue if it had been done within six hours, right?                Assuming it was a voluntary confession?                  The purpose of the law enforcement officers, if it's voluntary, is irrelevant under six hours.                  Well, doesn't it seem odd that the focus on flagrant conduct at 6:01 as being as important as you are emphasizing, but not -- but totally irrelevant at 5:59?

STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 07-1059                    Could you articulate precisely what your test is, because you have been going back and forth between whether the raw materials are fungible and whether there is a fundamental transformation in the product?              So, how would you merge those two in an articulable test so that business people can know when they are going to be subject to this regime and when they were not?                   You would say your ultimate touchstone is whether there is substantial transformation, and whether it's a raw material or discretion, those go into that determination?                  I'm sure you're prepared for a wide variety of hypotheticals.                  What about a diamond?    You have a chunk of rock that contains a diamond.    You send it to Antwerp and they carve it away into something that, I guess you could say it's been substantially transformed.               It's not just a rock. It's now a glittering diamond.               Is that covered by --                   Neither am I, and it's kind of -- it's sort of a bit of a concern.                  It's a fluctuating test that is hard to determine how it's going to be applied in a wide variety of cases.                    Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Farr. ORAL ARGUMENT OF H.

If the domestic entity provides wood, wooden two-by-fours, and the foreign entity coats it in a certain way, but they can use any two-by-fours, they are indistinguishable, you would say in that case there's still -- that's still subject to Commerce's position?

07-1114 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument next in Case 07-1114, Cone v. Bell. Mr. Goldstein. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   There is also a third thing that's uncontested, which is there is no Brady claim on the merits.         That's not at all included in your question presented.            The district court and the court of appeals concluded that there was no Brady violation on the merits.        I don't know what would happen if we sent this case back.           They would conclude it again.                     Well, but don't stop there.   On page 25a, they've been talking about those federalism issues.      They say:           "We need not be delayed by these interesting questions of federalism, however, because in all events the documents discussed in the dissenting opinion that were allegedly withheld are not Brady material."                     Well, but don't -- you've resolved your dilemma by not raising anything at all about the merits in the question presented?                  Well, let's start on page Roman xi, where the questions presented are. There's nothing in there about the merits of the Brady claim.   It's all about the procedural objections that you have.                  I -- I guess what I would say is you've got - habeas review of that claim because the district court decided it on the merits and the court of appeals decided it on the merits.                    Okay.   It seems to me you either did not raise the question or you did.                    If you did not, then we don't address the procedural issues that you raised. If you did, then also we have to resolve the question on the merits, a very fact-specific Brady claim that we would not normally take without reaching those procedural issues.      So, I don't see why the procedural issues are before us.                  Our -- our cases clearly hold that when you have alternate holdings, neither one is dicta.                  Well, that's fair for the Respondents to say, look, there's no reason to take this procedural -- complicated procedural issue, because we win on the merits.             And the court, as their view articulates, the court decided that question.                   I guess it's -- my questions and the questions and the points --                   -- that was raised about the time are related, because one reason these things drag on interminably is that you are -- exactly why you're raising this issue here, it's a procedural nicety or a procedural difficulty that arose some time ago in the State courts.        But since then the Federal courts, both the district court and the court of appeals have addressed it, and -- and that that's a good jurisprudential approach to say, particularly in a complicated case like this that is 26 years old, here's our answer on this, but so that we don't have to go through this again, if we're reversed on that, here's our -- our alternative holding; and they said right after the sentence I quoted, we said this before, and we now say it again:    This is not Brady material.                     That would -- that would then depend on us agreeing to review a very fact-bound, necessarily fact-bound, Brady question when the questions presented focused on a procedural issue.                    I didn't look, counsel, at your -- I don't know if it's yours or your predecessor counsel's brief in the -- appealing from the district court here to the court of appeals.                   Did that raise a discussion of the Brady claim on the merits, saying that the district court was wrong?                    That was -- that was not a friendly question.         My point is that you argued the merits of the Brady claim not only in the district court but specifically on appeal as well.                  So this wasn't sort of sua sponte addressing --                  -- the Brady claim as kind of a safety net on the procedural --                     Yes.   No, my -- my concern is not that you didn't brief the Brady claim; it is that -- whatever the non-pejorative synonym for "smuggled" it in -- is you smuggled it in on a case that purportedly presented a procedural objection and a conflict on a procedural issue.                    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein, you have three minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    Is there anything in the court of appeals' treatment of the Brady claim on the merits that suggests it also treated them separately in the different silos, as you put it?                    Where do they say that they're only considering the categories separately?                    That's the 2001 opinion.     Do they do that in the 2007 opinion?                   Thank you, counsel. I'm sorry, Mr. Goldstein, one moment.                   Did you raise -- cite Kyles in your petition for cert?                      Oh, I see it.   Yes. Pages 30 and 32.     Okay.
07-11191 +++$+++              We ll hear argument next in Case 07-11191, Briscoe v. Virginia. Mr. Friedman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS            But I assume you've picked the best example for you.           D.C. is a small place.   You go to a big State, and the lab is not always right next door.            Your answer to Justice Breyer has to be, of course, you would insist that the person be called.         It would be malpractice for you not to.            I'm sorry.    Entirely what?            Oh.               Or the dissent. (Laughter.)               Thank you, Mr. Friedman.              Thank you, counsel. Mr. Friedman, you have 4 minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS              Well, the -- just the first one, the no-notice problem, that's kind of silly, isn't it?    Because if you are being prosecuted for 50 grams of crack cocaine, you can expect the government is going to try to prove that.              Yes.
07-1122 +++$+++                   We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1122, Arizona v. Johnson. Mr. Parkhurst. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH L. PARKHURST ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Do you agree that there's a point in an interaction that begins with a traffic stop, begins with a seizure, at which the nature of that interaction is changed so that it's no longer -- so that it becomes a consensual interaction?                   Maybe I should rephrase the question.       Do you agree that it would be unconstitutional for an officer to conduct a pat down after an initial seizure while that same interaction still continues?                      Thank you, counsel. Mr. Heytens. ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER                      Do you agree that there is a point at which the encounter initiated by the traffic stop changes in some way that a pat down is no longer justified?                     Well, if the encounter is -- by "the encounter is over," do you mean that they separate; they're no longer together?                    My question is whether or not it's a continuing encounter but transforms somehow in its quality so that the pat down is no longer justified.                     I suppose there is an argument, anyway, that even though the initial seizure is over, the consensual encounter continues. And at some point the officer, as a result of whatever happens during that consensual exchange, becomes concerned for her safety.                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Parkhurst, you have a minute remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH L. PARKHURST ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
07-1125 +++$+++                      We will hear argument next in Case 07-1125, Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Committee. Mr. Rothfeld. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   Counsel, there is -- there is a little bit of an air of unreality about all this, because, of course, Congress didn't provide a cause of action in Title IX to start with.                And the reason they don't have all these limitations and restrictions is because they didn't put in the cause of action. We implied it from the statute, and so it seems kind of awkward to say:            Well, there are no limitations, as I said, when there was no cause of action.                   Did we rely on that provision in implying the right of action under Title IX?                   We will give you an extra ten seconds.                   Well, of course, Title IX is Spending Clause legislation, and that, under our precedents, imposes certain limitations on how we interpret it that would not be applicable under Section 1983.                   Well, the point is that that would then allow 1983 actions to circumvent those limitations on the Title IX remedy.                    I take it they don't have to bring these actions together.                     They can sue under Title IX; if they lose, then they can start a whole new lawsuit under 1983?                    Even if you have different -- I guess would you have a different set of defendants, right?      You would have the school in the Title IX case, the individuals in the 1983 action?                  Thank you, counsel.                     Thank you, Ms. Hodge.   Mr. Rothfeld, you have five minutes, remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
07-1209 +++$+++                     We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1209, Peake v. Sanders et al. Mr. Miller. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    You basically have four cases in the courts of appeals to support that proposition, right?                     Well, but this is -- I mean, it's kind of the -- it's the first notice.                  It gets the ball rolling.        I think it's like, you know, two teams and you don't tell one of the teams when the game starts and then you say, well, it doesn't matter because they would have lost anyway, there is no prejudice.                  Well, usually, when you have an appellate court, with a hard question, is easily divided, the case is resolved on the basis of the standard of review.      What is the presumption, if it's a close case?    And why isn't that all sort of what we are talking about here?      It's a close case, and the judge -- the panel says, well, this side has the burden of persuasion, so we're going to come out the other way.                  Well, what if what they would have done differently is get different medical tests, or done something like that, or have the doctor in the prior testing who prepared the diagnosis look at something that they didn't have them look at before?   In other words, it's not simply the absence of documents that they know they can submit or could have submitted.     It's that type of question where nobody knows.    I mean, you don't know what would have happened if they had the doctor look at the issue that now turns out to be critical, but if they had gotten the right notice they might have had time to do that.                    You know -- it's easy to look back and view this in the abstract legal terms, but we are dealing with lay people who are trying to get something from the government, which is always a difficult thing.     And you have one notice saying you have got to show that this was during the service, then they get another notice or decision saying it wasn't severe enough.     Why is it so difficult, when the government made a mistake in dealing with this layperson who is just trying to get benefits to which they are entitled, to say that the government has to show that it didn't make any difference, rather than requiring the layperson to do that?                     Mr. Miller, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    So you think it's perfectly clear from that what gaps need to be filled in?                   When you have been saying "entitled to a lawyer," do you mean entitled to a lawyer or allowed to have a lawyer?                   You can finish your --
07-1216 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1216, Philip Morris v. Williams. Mr. Shapiro. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    I suppose one reason -- one reason to think it may not have been decided is that, unlike the other situations you have discussed, it would not have been a bar to our consideration of this case the last time because, just as you raise the question in your second question presented that whether the award complies with due process, we may have thought there might have been an adequate and independent State ground on a procedural question, but we were going to go ahead.   We granted cert on the substantive question on whether the damages award was unconstitutional.                  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shapiro, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   I wasn't asking to you argue it, either but I mean I suppose the procedure the parties would prefer, if we were interested in that, would be for us to grant the second question and then have the normal briefing in consideration.                   Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.
07-1223 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument next in Case 07-1223, Bell versus Kelly. Mr. Bress. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. BRESS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Well, weren't the facts merely cumulative evidence of his claim that was before the State court?                  Well, I think that supports my suggestion, which is that the evidence was cumulative.    There was a dispute on that issue.             There was evidence on both sides.               And now you say, hey, we've got more evidence.                   Mr. Bress, your -- you're argument that this can't be brought up assumes that it is a new claim rather than the same claim, right?   Because if it were just the same claim then the question would be it is simply cumulative rather than new?                   Right.   And I guess it gets back to Justice Ginsburg's question.                  We usually don't consider claims different if there is just new evidence, but here didn't the Fourth Circuit necessarily determine that this was the same claim in deciding to defer to the State court findings?                   And if fact you got more than you were entitled to, because it did look at the new evidence, albeit through the guise of deference, but it shouldn't have even looked at that at all.                  So if we think that they were right -- and we are, I think we are getting away from the question presented -- if we agree that they are right, that this is the same claim and it's just additional evidence, then you lose.                   I know, but they're -- your underlying theory is that if you get a lot of new evidence, that somehow changes the claim.                 And again, I think Justice Ginsburg -- I'm having trouble getting my arms around that, and particularly since it's problematic in this area where there is always new evidence. You're looking at someone's childhood.                   You can always find a new anecdote, a new concern going either way, that you know, this was unusual because he was a good child, or this is excused because he had such a bad upbringing.                   All right, well just -- we've got two but just to stop you on one.                    The fact that they excuse your failure to raise and present the evidence in State court doesn't mean that when you get the evidence you have a new claim.                 It just means that they are going to let you raise a claim you could have raised before.                   I've gotten over it.                      Thank you, counsel.                      You have three minute remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. BRESS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                      You have three minutes remaining.                    So, it's a new claim if it is one on which you would have prevailed, but it's the same claim if the result would be the same.
07-1239 +++$+++                   We will hear argument first in Case 07-1239, Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council.           General Garre. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                     That's the temporary stay pending certiorari, right?                     I think what Justice Ginsburg was talking about -- and she can correct me if I am wrong -- were the modifications from the initial preliminary injunction and the modified preliminary injunction.                  Let me follow that. You concede that you have to prepare an EIS in light of the CEQ's emergency circumstances?                     Why didn't you -- I mean, you emphasize the level of detail and comprehensiveness of the environmental assessment that the Navy prepared.      Why didn't you just make -- why didn't you just go ahead and do an EIS from the outset if you were going to engage in such effort with respect to the environmental assessment?                   But why -- I don't know if this is Justice Souter's question, but why CEQ? I mean, NEPA doesn't really give anybody any regulatory authority -- EPA, CEQ.       And it seems to me that CEQ is an odd entity to be doing this.              They're more or less an office in the White House, rather than a free-standing agency.                  An environmental assessment.                   Thank you, counsel.                    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garre, have you one minute remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G.

07-1315 +++$+++                   We will hear argument this afternoon in Case 07-1315, Knowles v. Mirzayance. Mr. Mercer. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN E. MERCER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  Would that -- would that principle have to be clearly established by one of our decisions?                  Well, isn't that -- the fundamental question is what level of generality you look to determine what law has been clearly established? Certainly Strickland is clearly established.                  But as far as I can tell, the "nothing to lose" issue has not been addressed by us and is not clearly established.                    So why do we look at it at the latter level of generality as opposed to the former?                   So you think -- I guess it's not open to us to issue a decision on the "nothing to lose" question or we don't have to.                  It's the only -- the way we have to decide the case is to determine whether the Ninth Circuit's determination on the "nothing to lose" question was clearly established by one of our cases.                  I don't understand why you keep talking about Strickland.                   We sent this case back to the Ninth Circuit for further consideration in light of Carey v. Musladin.               In that case we said that the grant of relief was unreasonable because of the lack of holdings from this Court regarding the potentially prejudicial effect of spectators' courtroom conduct of the kind involved here, which seems to me a much narrower focus on the level of generality than Strickland. I would have thought you would have said -- maybe you are saying -- that because we don't have a precedent from this Court rejecting the "nothing to lose" case, that that should be the end of it.                  Mr. Mercer, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN E. MERCER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  What would he have gotten in the high term?

SAHARSKY ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER                   Well, you say there is no deterrent value, since the police are -- are not going to do this if they know they are not going to be able to use this in their case-in-chief.                  But there is also no down side, is there? I mean, you say it's only for impeachment purposes, but, you know, why not?                He -- he may take the stand.   He may lie.     It is better to have this in the bank instead of not.                     Thank you, counsel. Mr. MCAllister, you have six minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R.

KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Well, it said "pertinent or relevant," but surely that's limited to the statutory provisions that we examined in the case.                  I -- this may be a purely academic distinction, but you talked in terms of liability.   Are you suggesting that the trust principles do not set a standard to which the Secretary is bound, or simply that they don't constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity?                   Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Kneedler, you have nine minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   I'm not sure that's responsive to justice Stevens's question.                 I mean, you are arguing the merits, but those haven't been decided.
07-1428 +++$+++                    We will hear argument today in Case 07-1428, Ricci v. DeStefano, and the consolidated case. Mr. Coleman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   Are you assuming --                   Are you --                     Counsel, some time ago you said you had two answers to Justice Breyer's question.   I would like to hear the second one.                   Maybe if you don't mind, you could remind me what the second answer was.                  Thank you, Mr. Coleman. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING VACATUR AND REMAND                     With respect to both blacks and whites, correct?                     So, can you assure me that the government's position would be the same if this test -- black applicants -- firefighters scored highest on this test in disproportionate numbers, and the City said we don't like that result, we think there should be more whites on the fire department, and so we're going to throw the test out?                  The government of United States would adopt the same position?                     Yeah.                     That's the part I don't understand.    What you're saying is that the department can engage in intentional discrimination to avoid concern that they will be sued under disparate impact.     Why doesn't it work the other way around as well?     Why don't they say, well, we've got to tolerate the disparate impact because otherwise, if we took steps to avoid it, we would be sued for intentional discrimination?     This idea that there is this great dilemma -- I mean, it cuts both ways.                     Counsel, this may be the same question Justice Breyer asked, but I'd like something closer to a yes or no answer.                  Does the government consider promotion of diversity by itself a compelling state interest in the employment context as opposed to the school context?                     Can it be --                     Can it be advanced by taking actions to avoid what is perceived as a disparate impact?                     In other words, the disparate impact is regarded as something you can intentionally respond to by drawing racial distinctions solely because you would like a more diverse workforce?                    It didn't care --                    It didn't care -- it had to draw racial distinctions because it looked at the test and said, we think there's a problem because of the racial makeup of who's going to get the promotions.                    It didn't look at names; it just looked at the label of what their race was.   That's all they were concerned about.                   Mr. Coleman, to keep the time even here, I think you have 8 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
07-1437 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument next in Case 07-1437, Carlsbad Technology v. HIF Bio, Inc. Mr. Rhodes. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN W. RHODES ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    I think there's no need to dress up anything.         I mean, as Justice Stevens point, you wouldn't have to dress up anything; if you send it back, it's not reviewable.                   Well, "woodenly" is a bit much.     I mean, they're going to read it not to say what it says.     And Thermtron involved the court saying: I'm not going to take this because I'm too busy with other things.     I mean, it could be limited to that unusual situation, couldn't it?                   And it would solve the problem Justice Ginsburg pointed out earlier, that this way you don't get to appeal big things like no subject matter jurisdiction, but you do get to appeal picayune things.                      You thought the Respondents asked us to overrule Thermtron.                On page 22, you say, "Respondents' implicit request for this Court to overrule Thermtron should be rejected."                   I mean, in one of those provisions they said this was only technical amendments, and if they're just doing technical amendments that doesn't mean they have to look at it and approve the whole thing.                    Well, they don't have a choice, right?      They can't say, I don't like the Supreme Court rule so I'm not going to apply it, other than the Federal Circuit. (Laughter.)                   Thank you, counsel. Thank you.     Mr. Rhodes, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN W. RHODES ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   I suppose, though, if it would be an abuse of discretion for the district court to retain jurisdiction, then maybe there is -- there never was jurisdiction, right?                    You said they have discretion to exercise or not.              If it turns out they don't have discretion to exercise, you know, because it's a huge State claim and a tiny Federal claim, why wouldn't that properly be regarded as an absence of jurisdiction?
07-1529 +++$+++                     We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1529, Montejo v. Louisiana. Mr. Verrilli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                     I'm sorry to interrupt, but isn't there a third, which is that you just don't assume anything and you wait to see if he makes -- says, "I want to talk to my lawyer," or he could well say, "You've told me," as was the case here, "I have a right to a lawyer, I don't have to say anything, I want to talk some more, I don't -- okay, there's a lawyer, fine, I want to talk without my lawyer, I want to waive my right to counsel."                        Which he can do.                  Right.      If you prevail and you say silence constitutes saying "I want to talk to my lawyer," that's right.                     I'm saying that's a false, a false alternative.                  Well, but the rule you're asking for would apply across the board.                     How would it apply in a case where the defendant is given Miranda warnings, says, thank you, I don't want to talk to my lawyer, I want to talk to you.                     He's talking to the police.    All of a sudden they bring a note in and say:    They've appointed a lawyer.               The police says:       I just got a note; you've been appointed a lawyer.                      Do you want to keep talking? You would say that's a violation, right? And then he says yes and continues to talk.                   That's a violation, even though he knows that if he wanted a lawyer he could request one, he knows one's been appointed for him, and he's been warned that if he doesn't want to talk without a lawyer he doesn't have to, and he's in the middle of a conversation that he initiated, and the police says, do you want to keep talking?           That's a violation?                   Early on, before the lawyer was appointed, he's given Miranda warnings and he says:   I want to talk.       He's talking.              They say:    Now, we just got the word; a lawyer has been appointed; do you want to keep talking?           He says yes.           That's a violation?                     Well, I'm trying to -- which stage are you talking about, before the lawyer was appointed or after?          I'm telling you before he was appointed, the police did not initiate the conversation. They told him he didn't have to talk.                      He says:   I want to talk.   Now, you're saying it counts as initiating the interrogation if they say:            You've got a lawyer; do you want to keep talking?                     How is he -- where is the initiation?      Is it when he says, yes, I want to keep talking, after being told -- asked do you want to keep talking?     Or is it way back at the beginning?                     At the outset.                     Isn't that what happened here?     He had been given his Miranda warnings, right?                   Again, you are arguing the facts of a particular case, and we are looking at a rule that is going to apply across the board.    In a particular case, as you say, the Louisiana Supreme Court said this almost violated his Fifth Amendment right.    There are protections against the actual coercion, which it seems to me you're arguing. As I understood Justice Scalia's question, he says: Don't you have to assume that there is coercion even in the mildest case, not the most extreme one, but the mildest one?                   A right that you can relinquish, a right that you can waive, and all that's being suggested is that it is not totally determinative whether the police say:         Do you want to keep talking, or if the defendant says:        I want to keep talking.                   Right, and whether or --                     -- whether or not your -- your dialogue with my colleagues about overruling Jackson -- putting that to one side, what you are arguing is an extension of Jackson from the context in which it arose to this context.                     Mr. Verrilli, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
07-1601 +++$+++                     We will hear argument first this morning in case 07-1601, Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company et al. v. United States. Ms. Sullivan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 07-1607                     What if your shipper here knew that every time he delivered one of these truckloads of the chemical, one-third of it would end up on the ground and seeping through the ground, and no doubt about it, he knew that, and yet they kept sending it?   Wouldn't that be arranging for the disposal of at least a third of the shipment?                    But your argument assumes a sharp distinction between useful product and waste.   Yet it's quite common to talk about there being waste associated with a useful product.                  When you use up so much of this, there's going to be a certain percentage of waste.                   That's making it too easy for you.    It would mean all of those people would be liable when in the course of delivering stuff they know there's going to be a certain amount that's going to spill, and even, perhaps the Justice Alito hypothetical, they could have easily chose the truck that causes more spill rather than the one that causes less.    It's not simply here's the product, we're gone, see you later, and all of a sudden there's a spill.                    No, no, i know.   But I'm trying to reach the extent of your argument.                 So in that type of a case would there be arranger liability?                     Thank you, counsel. Ms. Mahoney. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 07-1601                      What if -- what if you have a situation where it's clear under apportionment one party is liable for one-tenth and the other is liable for nine-tenths, but one-tenth is enough to pollute the -- the water.              Do you have apportionment in that situation?                    Well, I assume it's not a linear, if that's the right word, progression, because once you've got to start a clean-up, you've got to start a clean-up, whether it's, you know, caused by one-tenth or -- or nine-tenths.                    What about the issue of insolvency?   You have talked about the Restatements. There's the comment H to one of the Restatement provisions that says you don't apportion if one of the other parties is insolvent.                   I'm not sure I know what it means to say it's a divisible harm.                   So that means that whatever percentage of responsibility the parties have, that's the percentage of cost that they --                     So does that mean that, let's say, the -- how does that work when it costs $2 million to sort of start a clean-up, no matter who, and then, you know, the more stuff there is, the extra million it is?    Is that -- is -- is the initial cost a divisible harm?
07-208 +++$+++                     We'll hear argument first today in Case 07-208, Indiana versus Edwards. Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   What would happen if you started out with pro se representation and then the trial turned into a farce?          Start over again, but he would have to accept counsel at that point?                   So your standard of coherent communication, you would not require the defendant, for example, to understand the hearsay rule, or other things of that sort?                    Well, even if you don't, I mean, how is he going to effectively participate in the trial?           Does he have to know, for example, that he has the right and understand that he has the right to cross-examine witnesses?                  What if he -- what if he wants to communicate not self-defense, but that, you know, Martians did it?          Is he -- and he can coherently communicate that.            There won't be any doubt on the judge's part or the jury that he thinks Martians did it?   Would that qualify?                  Well, I mean, I'm trying to find some level that is above competency.                     I mean, there are people who believe in Martians, but above competence to stand trial, but also that would still be coherently communicated, but would show that it's a ridiculous defense that's not going to be effective in representing himself.

07-21 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument first today in Case 07-21 and 07-25, Crawford v. Marion County Election Board and Indiana Democratic Party v. Secretary Rokita. Mr. Smith. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                     We can limit your standing argument to -- I guess it's based on the affidavits of Ms. Holland and Ms. Smith, the one who is a clerk for the Democratic Party and the other who is a judge for the Democratic Party.               We don't have to agree with you that anybody who votes, might vote Democratic, is enough to give you standing.                   Well, I understood Judge Barker to say that you had not come up with a single instance of somebody who was denied the right to vote because they didn't have a photo ID.                   So elections were conducted under this law?                  But why -- and they're not going to be able to get one even though the State will provide them with one if they don't have one, subject to some identification?                   That would be potentially constitutional?                   Okay.     So we should ignore your religious objection argument in this case?                    Well, how far away is the furthest county seat for somebody in the county,                    County seats aren't very far for people in Indiana.                   We have -- the record shows that fewer than 1 percent of people in Indiana don't have a photo ID.                     Well, so do the voting rolls.   I thought the district court found 41 --                     Mr. Smith.                     -- 41.4 percent of the people on the voting rolls in Indiana were either dead or they were duplicate entries.                     Do you take issue with the 41.4 percent figure for bad entries on the voting registration rolls?                     And this is one of them, I suppose, requiring photo ID?                   Well, don't you think if you have the voter rolls with a significant number of bad registrants, either dead or duplicates, that that presents a significant potential for fraud?                   Well, that's because it's less of an issue.       If somebody wins an election by 500,000 votes, you may not be terribly worried if some percentage were cast by fraud, but you might look to the future and realize there could be a closer election and there -- it's a type of fraud that, because it's fraud, it's hard to detect.                   But the problem with the duplicate entries is there may be two entries for John Smith because John Smith has moved and the voter registration hasn't been updated.                  So all you need is somebody else to go in and say:                I'm John Smith, this is my address.     And later in the day somebody else comes in and says:     I'm John Smith and this is my address.                   And because they're duplicates it's really difficult to check.                   They help you get it.    They say if you don't have an ID we'll give you one.    If you don't have a photo ID, come in and we'll give you one.                   What documentation did President Carter and Secretary Baker propose to require for their photo IDs?                   Thank you, General Clement.    Mr. Smith, three minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                  You said it serves no purpose.    What if we determine that it does serve a purpose in preventing fraud.             How are we supposed to weigh that against your asserted burden on the right to vote?
07-210 +++$+++                     We'll hear argument next in Case 07-210, Bridge versus Phoenix Bond & Indemnity. Mr. Becker. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE M. BECKER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                  Are all the shell corporations still bidding?                  Thank you, Mr. Becker.                   Mr. DeBruin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. DeBRUIN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS MR. DeBRUIN:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It is presumed true in this case that Petitioners submitted false affidavits, filled the auction room with related entities, and obtained thousands of liens that would have been awarded to Respondents and other bidders, causing them injury in fact.    I submit the central issue in this case is whether on those facts Respondents can establish proximate cause, and specifically whether in order to do so they must establish that they personally received and relied upon the false statements at issue. I submit that this Court already has established in its decisions in Holmes and in Anza the proper test for proximate cause.                 And no claim has been made in this case, at least not until perhaps briefly this morning, that the Respondents cannot establish proximate cause under the standards set forth in those cases.    Moreover, no argument is made that the standards articulated in Holmes and in Anza are insufficient to ferret out the appropriate cases that can go forward; that those cases produce anomalous results either here or in any other case that has been decided.                    Well, but I suppose since we are talking about a rotational rule, you could have -- what are these, monthly or annually --                      one, possibly, cycle where it's all zero percent, and then others where it isn't, and then another where it is. And that would affect the rotation in a way that would injure your client but would also injure the county. MR. DeBRUIN:        Not the way the county administers these auctions.            If that happened -- and it certainly could happen -- that the bidding process that takes the penalty down stopped at five percent or two percent, the county rules under the program at issue provide the county will not apply the rotational system. It won't award the lien at all. The rotational rule only applies when there are multiple, zero-percent bids.              And Respondents will show, as this case goes forward, that they can identify the specific properties on which there were multiple bids; that the Petitioners and the related entities, which they will prove are related, received liens and thereby increased to the thousands the number of valuable liens that the Petitioners got, leaving the Respondents essentially with hundreds of liens. The key is, the central question is, whether Petitioners can show proximate cause under the standards in Holmes and Anza.     And under Anza what this Court held is the central question for proximate cause is the directness between the violation alleged and the injury. And in this case there is a direct relation between the violation of mail fraud alleged, the predicate acts, and the injury that Respondents have incurred.                  Regardless of how many competitors there are? MR. DeBRUIN:        Well, yes.             As this Court recognized in Storey Parchment and Hazeltine, in antitrust cases as well as RICO cases, damage issues have to be worked out.         But the fact that there may be multiple bidders that you may have to award damages to a group does not defeat the claim.                 The defendant cannot come into court and say because damages here have to be allocated among a larger number of people, you can't establish a claim.                  Thank you, Mr. Miller.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                    So the shipowner is, I suppose, the owner of Exxon or the hundreds of thousands of shareholders, right?                  So you have to have a shareholder driving the boat before you can assess liability?                    So it's not quite correct to say only the owner.                In other words, it is a certain level of employee, because corporations only act through individuals.        It is a certain level of employee in the company. Now, where do you draw the line between the CEO and the cabin boy?         How do you do that?            And I would suspect, just instinctively, that somebody driving one of these huge tankers is a lot closer to the CEO than the cabin boy.                   That is only true if you lose on your second and third questions as well, right?                   The answers to your second and third questions preclude a new trial?                   Well, the City of Milwaukee involved the displacement by Federal statutory law of Federal common law.         Your case involves the displacement of Federal maritime law by Federal statutory law. Federal maritime law is routine.                     Federal courts do that all the time.           Federal common law is unusual, and in the City of Milwaukee was resorted to simply by necessity. Doesn't that suggest that whatever the Federal maritime rule on punitive damages is, it's a harder showing on your part to conclude that it's displaced by the statutory process?                  Mr. Dellinger, did you say you had a second and a third point?                  You going to get to them?                    All right.                  Thank you, Mr. Fisher.

07-290 +++$+++                     We will hear argument today in Case 07-290, District of Columbia versus Heller. Mr. Dellinger. ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS Good morning, Mr. Chief                   If you're right, Mr. Dellinger, it's certainly an odd way in the Second Amendment to phrase the operative provision.                If it is limited to State militias, why would they say "the right of the people"?   In other words, why wouldn't they say "state militias have the right to keep arms"?                   But if that's right, doesn't that cut against you?             If the militia included all the people, doesn't the preamble that you rely on not really restrict the right much at all?                   It includes all the people.                  Well, that may be true, but that concedes your main point that there is an individual right and gets to the separate question of whether the regulations at issue here are reasonable.                   Well, but your reading of the militia clause, the militia clause specifically reserves concern rights to the States by its terms.   And as I understand your reading, you would be saying the Second Amendment was designed to take away or expand upon the rights that are reserved, rather than simply guaranteeing what rights were understood to be implicit in the Constitution itself.                   Well, the militia clause, Article I, Section 8, says certain rights are reserved to the States with respect to the militia.                  And yet you're telling us now that this was a very important right that ensured that they kept arms, but it wasn't listed in the rights that were reserved in the militia clause.                  What is -- what is reasonable about a total ban on possession?                  So if you have a law that prohibits the possession of books, it's all right if you allow the possession of newspapers?                  The regulation -- the regulation at issue here is not one that goes to the number of guns.   It goes to the specific type.                And I understood your argument to be in your brief that because rifles and shotguns are not banned to the staple extent as handguns, it's all right to ban handguns.                  Well, I'm not sure that it's accurate to say the opinion below allowed those.    The law that the opinion, the court below, was confronted with was a total ban, so that was the only law they considered. If the District passes a ban on machine guns or whatever, then that law -- that law would be considered by the court and perhaps would be upheld as reasonable.    But the only law they had before them was a total ban.                  Are you allowed to carry the weapons that are allowed?                      I read the "carry clause" to apply without qualification.                      So while you say you might be able to have a shotgun in the home, you can't carry it to get there.  We'll make sure you have remain, Mr. Dellinger. rebuttal.                   Thank you, Gura. Mr. Dellinger, 10 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                  Well, before you start with it, how many minutes does it take to remove a trigger lock and load a gun?           Because both the gun has to be unloaded; it has to have a trigger lock under the District laws.                  No, disassembled --                  In either case it has to be unloaded, correct?                  Well, the law, as I understand it, says that the gun has to be unloaded.                  So under your hypothetical, I assume that would violate the District's law if the gun is still loaded.                  So how long does it take?   If your interpretation is correct, how long does it take to remove the trigger lock and make the gun operable.                  Is it like that?   Is it a numerical code?                  So then you turn on the lamp, you pick up your reading glasses -- (Laughter.)                  It may not matter, but I'd like some idea about how long it takes.                  Well, if proportionate, in other words you're saying your interest is allowing self-defense in the home --                  Does it really make sense to say the best self-defense arm is a rifle, as opposed to a pistol?                  It's a related point.   Do you understand the ban -- the carry ban to apply if you carry the firearm from one room in the house to another?                  Why is the -- why is the D.C. law phrased in those terms?                     In other words, if you can't have a handgun at all, why do you have a separate provision saying that you can't carry it anywhere?                  Why isn't that covered by the provision that you have the right to keep arms?

JAY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Could the IRS say that the statute -- or Congress, I guess, say the statute of limitations is one month?                   Yes, and anything after that, any constitutional violation after that, is just not remediable?                    Five weeks before.

I mean, you wouldn't say they could have a statute of limitations of two days, right?                   Thank you, counsel.
07-312 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument next in Case 07-312, Florida Department of Revenue versus Piccadilly Cafeterias. Mr. Makar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT D. MAKAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER Mr. Chief Justice, and may it                   I suppose one of the reasons would be how far do you go back?                    I mean, you go back three years and say, well, you know, the bankruptcy judge can say, part of what I'm confirming is the sale that took place three years ago, so you can file for a refund, I guess.                   Well, why does there have to be -- there has to be a filing for bankruptcy before you get a plan confirmed, but I didn't understand that to be the threshold before -- what does that mean, there has to be a filing for bankruptcy?                 That the confirmation of the plan can't go back before that?                  It goes back before then in a lot of cases to look for preferential transfers and things like that.                  I thought your answer to Justice Breyer was saying there's another key event and that's the filing of the petition for bankruptcy.                  Counsel, I'm not sure I understand the practical consequences of your I assume that if you're right, people who position. have an interest in buying the bankrupt business will wait or have to wait until after confirmation of the plan, because the tax liability is going to save them a lot of money.    Is it going to work in that case?                  I mean, will the effect of your plan be that it will discourage people who come along and want to buy a bankrupt business?                  I don't understand why this is a big deal.        Assuming that was news to me, that this only arises after the filing of a bankruptcy petition, and you are looking forward to confirmation of the plan, this tax only applies at the transfer of title. Why don't you just get your deal together and just say, well, the closing is going to be the day after confirmation of the bankruptcy plan?                  And that's when you transfer title, and that's when you have to pay the stamp tax. Well, that, in the ordinary                  How long does it typically take from the filing of the petition to confirmation of the bankruptcy plan?                  Thank you, Mr. Brunstad. Mr. Makar, you have five minutes remaining, and during those five minutes I hope you'll give an answer if you have one to the 365(g)(1) argument that your friend has made. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT D. MAKAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                     So your argument is that you don't have a rejection of the executory conduct -- contract --     until the plan is confirmed?               That's what Congress --
07-320 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument first today in Case 07-320, Davis v. The Federal Election Commission. Mr. Herman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW D. HERMAN ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT                  There is no restriction whatsoever on the wealthier candidate.                   He can spend as much of his money as he wants.                    Well, what if, for example, somebody takes out a television ad that says smoking this type of cigarette is actually, is not harmful to you.   The government is free to take out a contrary ad saying, no, it is and so you shouldn't do it, right?                    So governmental responses to the exercise of free speech are not automatically -- don't automatically burden the exercise of that speech.                    Well then, why does it burden it for the government to make it easier for private citizens to respond to that speech.                   What case supports that proposition?                   Government can't engage in political speech.                  You don't think that would be any more constitutional than this, do you?                  Counsel, you said earlier that money is -- money is speech in this area. So I take it you think that the restrictions, otherwise applicable restrictions on the less wealthy candidate, raise problems under the First Amendment?                  So this law eases those problematic restrictions.             It's less violative of the First Amendment.                  Well, but your candidate isn't subject to any restriction at all on what he can spend and his opponent is subject to less restrictions.    It seems to me the First Amendment comes out better.                  I think -- I mean, obviously you're correct that this system benefits incumbents, but it benefits your client in a particular way as well.   The parties are certainly interested in candidates who will fund themselves because that presents less strain on the party's resources.                   I'm not sure we need characterizations of the political candidates -- (Laughter.)                   -- in this forum.                  Thank you, General Clement. Mr. Herman, you may take five minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW D. HERMAN ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
07-330 +++$+++                     We will hear argument first today in Case 07-330, Greenlaw versus United States. Ms. Howe. ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY HOWE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER Mr. Chief Justice, and may it                    I would have thought it would depend on what the mandate from the court of appeals said.   If the mandate said the sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing, it seems to me that leaves open the full range of legitimate sentencing.                    Well, but the court of appeals -- if your argument is correct, the court of appeals is limited solely by virtue of the failure to file a notice of cross-appeal.               That -- that's a limitation that wouldn't apply in the district court.                  Thank you, Ms. Howe. Ms. Maynard. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  Well, usually the mandate in these cases simply says, you know, the case is remanded to the district court. If that's all the mandate says, does that authorize the district court to do the right thing under the law?                  So the -- the defendant who is appealing has to be very careful about the relief he requests?         He says I don't want the sentence vacated; I want the sentence reduced to five years instead of 10. And nothing else?            That's the only relief I seek?                   In that context, aren't -- aren't you concerned about enlisting the court of appeals in doing something illegal?                    I mean, they know that what they're authorizing, or imposing really, as a sentence is illegal.                   I'm reminded of what we do in statutory cases.          If one party says this is, it should be read A, and the other party says it should be read B, we've had cases where we say, well, they're both wrong, and we're going to read the statute as C because we the Court want to do the right thing.                   No, in my hypothetical they weren't agreeing.                     One side was saying B, the other side was saying A.                    And the right answer was C.                    Is there problem of getting the Solicitor General's office to authorize the appeal? (Laughter.)                  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Howe, you have two minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AMY HOWE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
07-343 +++$+++                     We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 07-343, Kennedy versus Louisiana. Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    Well, speaking of Roper and Atkins, is it -- is it only work in one way? How are you ever supposed to get consensus moving in the opposite direction?      In other words, you look to the number of States under Roper and Atkins who impose it, and you say, well, most of them are abolishing it, so we think it's unconstitutional, combined with other factors. Now, if there's going to be a trend the other way, how does that happen?                As soon as the first State says, well, we're going to impose the death penalty for child rape, you say, well, there isn't a consensus, so it's unconstitutional.                   And do 20 States have to get together and do it at the same time?                   Or how are they supposed to move the inquiry under Atkins and Roper in the opposite direction?                  And the trend since 1995, '90, has been more and more States are passing statutes imposing the death penalty in situations that do not result in death.                  Well, let me ask -- we will put that to one side, but how much movement you need. I'm more interested in the analytic question:    How does it happen?             I mean because your position would be every one -- a case in every one of those States, whatever the number is, is unconstitutional because we've said the trend is the other way. Well, how does a trend ever get started in the opposite direction?                  But you want to say this is -- you want to say this is unconstitutional because most States do it the other way.                 And I assume if a similar case arose in Texas involving capital punishment in a nondeath case, you would say well, most go the other way.    In other words, if you knock them down one by one, it is kind of hard to get a trend going.                  If somebody in this case is tried and convicted under that law, you would say:   Well, that's unconstitutional because there is not a sufficient trend in favor of that. And it just seems to me that that understanding of Atkins and Roper prevents the development of the law except in one direction. As I said, it may be                  I know, but, as I pointed out, it is very expensive to run a regime in which you have the death penalty.                And I can see the legislators in those States saying, well, we've got Coker on the books.     We've only got one State.               Why would we want to be the second State and go through this process and then have the Supreme Court throw it out? You know, everyone is waiting for the next State. I mean it's a very difficult process, it seems to me, to run the evolution of the law in both directions.   And then if you're insisting on a trend of whatever -- I don't know what the number is, 15, or 20, or 30 States -- it just can't materialize when you have Coker there and you have Atkins looking only in one direction.                  I wonder if Atkins and Roper are qualitatively different, considering the mental retardation of the offender, the youth of the offender.   Those are issues that go, as we said in Roper and Atkins, to culpability.              In other words, they are focused on the offender. This is quite different.                   It is focused on the nature of the offense.          And I wonder if that's more something on which we have less basis for determining the issue than a legislature.             We can look at the question of characteristics of the offender and make a judgment about that.      I don't know how we decide this for the reason you were just saying:                    What crimes are more serious than others? I wonder if it brings into play our jurisprudence on things like the three-strikes law and others where we sort of say:            We can't judge how serious crimes are and which ones are more serious than others, and so we leave that to another branch.                   But we're talking about --                   -- if were talking about evolving trends, I think it's fair to say that society's recognition of the seriousness of the crime of rape has evolved even since, the period since Coker. Now isn't that something that we should take into consideration?                   It certainly involved -- evolved since the time of Blackstone and even since -- as I say, even since Coker.                So while Coker may have thought rape of an adult wasn't serious enough to warrant the death penalty when the legislature had made a contrary determination, perhaps that would be addressed differently if -- differently today; and certainly rape of a child would be understood not to be not included in Coker's analysis.                   Coker, of course, repeatedly in the statement of the facts and the analysis, repeatedly referred to the victim as an adult woman.   It seems to me the Court was taking -- was being very careful to leave open the question of what would be the analysis in the case of a child.                  Thank you, Mr. Cruz. Mr. Fisher, we'll give you five minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    I thought -- the bulk of your argument, though, it seems to me, would not -- would be the same in a recidivist case, because, of course, that doesn't result in death either.                   I mean, I don't -- it is sort of a factual distinction but I don't see how it helps your argument.                   I'm not sure that the sort of trends that they look to in Roper and Atkins -- I mean, you had different crimes that carried the capital punishment as well.              I don't think we're looking at trends in that regard.
07-371 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument next in Case 07-371, Taylor versus Sturgell. Ms. Rosenbaum. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADINA ROSENBAUM ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  When you have a situation where it is an associational standing case, and an individual is the one that's relied upon give the association standing, in that case is the individual, even though he's not bringing the suit, is he barred by the association's case?                   What about if it is the executive director of the association, and the suit is brought in the name the association, and they lose. Can he bring suit as, you know, I'm just Joe Blow, but I happen to be the executive director, but I'm bringing this in my own name?                  Well, let's say that it is somebody above him, you know, the president of the association, who decides what lawsuits are brought, and he's just the executive director?                  But he recommended to the president, said we ought to file this lawsuit. The president said okay, and they did, and then they lost.   Can he go ahead as an individual?                   Well, that means your statement implicates very serious questions of standing under Article III, whether Congress can say create the injury by saying you've been denied records and, therefore, you have standing.                 I think that's -- I wouldn't go ahead assuming that that was correct.                  What if you have a situation where a client has retained a law firm to do something and the law firm as part of its normal activity files a FOIA request?              They think something useful is going to come up there, and it's denied, and the law firm on its own, and not as the -- not as retained by the company files a FOIA suit? In that case, is the company bound by the determination in the case?         Or can they then file another action?                  No, the law firm -- the law firm files its own FOIA request, and it is denied, and they litigate that, and then they lose, and the company brings a FOIA action.                  Right.                  Yes.                  But -- I guess to be fair to my hypothetical, it was the company that was paying for what the law firm was doing.                   It just wasn't the -- the filing of the suit.                The law firm went off on it own.    Maybe it does it all the time when they have a case, they think this might be helpful and they are filing a FOIA request.                  Is it purely a formal inquiry?    In other words, let's say the company is paying the law firm to represent, but the law firm just filed in its own name?               Does that make a difference?                  Well, it's a company --                  Let's say some group, say, Public Citizen Litigation Group sends a fundraising thing around saying we think all our members ought to contribute to a special fund so that we can bring a lawsuit under FOIA.             Are all of those individual contributors then bound by the result?                  So it make as difference if it's one company as opposed to 40 donors?                  Well, then in the previous hypothetical there was no authority to represent.   They just said, "I think this is a good idea, here's the money.        Here."                  Well, controls.   So there are three companies, and they each have -- you know, they can vote.      They each have 33-percent control. Are they each bound, or because they didn't control it none of them are bound?                    Well, they said, yes, you can represent us, and we're three different companies, and, you know, it's a majority vote as to what you can do.                    Thank you, counsel.                   Thank you, Ms. Stetson. Ms. Rosenbaum, four minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ADINA H. ROSENBAUM, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   What if two people get together who want the same documents for the same purpose, which is they think they're going to make money off of it.    And they say which ever gets it we'll share with the other and we'll split the money we're going to get?                   Separate -- separate suits, separate requests, separate suits.                  They just want to double their chances of getting the documents, but they agree to split.           They think they're going to make a hundred dollars off of this and agree to split it 50-50, regardless of who wins.                  Do you think we need to remand this for consideration of whether or not there was an agreement, if we conclude that what we see from the court of appeals opinion isn't enough? As I understand, the court of appeals didn't think an agreement was necessary.               So regardless of what the district court said, al thought that was an issue that was litigated, it was not passed on by the court of appeals.
07-411 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument first this morning in Case No. 07-411, Plains Commerce Bank versus Long Family Land and Cattle Company. Mr. Banker. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL A. BANKER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  Well, what is a tribe supposed to do?    Let's say there is a gas station on the reservation.    The tribe has a tax.                 Anybody doing business -- it's, you know, 1 percent of gross proceeds. And at the end of the year the gas station owner says, well, I'm just not going to pay it.                       What do they do then?                  So you think there would be -- there would be tribal-court jurisdiction in the case I hypothesized?                  So your case, your entire case, is based on whether or not there's consent to dealing with the tribe by the nonmember?                  Well, your clients could they fully protect themselves.                    What if the tribe sought to enforce tribal law against them, can they bring that claim in State court?                  Right.     Well, just like this and there was a choice of forum provision, says, well, you've got to bring this in State court.                   I thought there were restrictions on whether or not tribal law can be enforced in State courts.                  Even if it -- well, that's if it's a contract claim.               What if it's a discrimination or Indian common law claim arising out of the contractual relationship?                     Thank you, counsel. Mr. Banker, you have two minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL A. BANKER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
07-440 +++$+++                     We will now hear argument in Case 07-440, Rothgery v. Gillespie County, Texas. Ms. Spinelli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Counsel, how can this -- how can this be part of an adversary proceeding when there's no other adversary on the field?                 The prosecution's not present.         They don't even know anything about this.                   Well, in Jackson of course the charges had already been filed by the prosecutor, so there was an adversary on the field.                  Well, I suppose -- I suppose you could you have an adversarial proceeding without the prosecutor present, but it would depend on the nature of the proceeding.               And here the magistrate simply advises the individual of the charges against him, repeats the Miranda warnings, advises him that he can have counsel if bail is denied or if he can't make bail.   What about that is adversarial?                   Well, I guess I'll get back to the point I raised earlier, that in Jackson charges had already been filed by a prosecutor.                    The prosecutor was aware of this proceeding.                    I think that's a fairly significant distinction.                     The two are kind of related.   If in fact there's not a right to counsel upon the magistration, but, as you said earlier to Justice Alito, it attaches at the end of the magistration, it seems to me like you're asking for counsel to be an investigator rather than to participate in the trial proceedings.                  Why not, if they initiate charges against them?               You're saying, in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, you're charged with, for example, trespassing or conducting a demonstration on the court grounds, and that's a crime.                     You're charged with that, but we are not going to hold you, so, you know, come back in a month.                  Before he said no, I don't want an examining trial.             As soon as he says that, then he can have one, and you're saying he should have had a lawyer before he said that?                  But he could do it; anyone else could do it.          And you would say, once he does that, he's made it into a critical proceeding, and so you have to have counsel before he gives up that right?                   Well, then -- but then you are saying that he has a right to counsel at the magistration, because that's when the magistrate says:    Look, you have an examining trial coming up, and you can waive your right to that.                   What does he say about the examining --                   What does he say about an examining --                  Well, not exactly these facts, because in Jackson the prosecutor had already filed charges.                  But the prosecutor wasn't involved here.     The prosecutor was involved in Jackson.                  So Texas would be better off if they didn't have a magistration proceeding at all, if they didn't have a proceeding to alert the individual of the charges against him; they did not have a proceeding to read him his rights; they did not have a determination of probable cause.              They would be better off if they didn't do any of that?                  Well, what's in it for the State to provide this additional layer? Because, of course, the person gets Miranda warnings when he is arrested.     And so why -- why should the State do this?                  Why don't you take an extra minute?   We have eaten up your rebuttal time.                   Thank you, Counsel.
07-455 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument next in Case 07-455, United States versus Ressam. General Mukasey. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. MICHAEL B. MUKASEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    Your argument relies on the notion that the word "during" in the statute is solely temporal.    In other words, it just refers to the time?                    So -- that's not always the case.    If I say, you know, I hung lights during the holiday season, you wouldn't think that I hung a chandelier, right?           There'd be not simply a temporal connection, but also a relation.                  Why is there in the statutes a difference between possession of explosives in this circumstance and possession of firearms?                  Is there any --                   Is there any policy limitation within the department not to charge under this provision unless there is a relationship between the underlying felony and the use of -- the carrying of explosives?                   The ten years, though, is mandatory, correct?                   So if a prosecutor asks for it and there is an underlying felony and there is an explosive, that's an additional ten years, no matter what.                  So if you get -- the underlying felony is of the sort Justice Scalia was talking about, and let's say the person gets probation on that because, you know, it is the first offense, no harm, he still gets ten years.                  Well, but how many cases are there likely to be -- this isn't one of them -- where you have no "in relation to" connection whatsoever?                  Or any historical record that you're familiar with.                  I mean, in this case, as you point out, there was, of course, a connection.   And I would have thought in most cases where the prosecutor is interested in charging - because, as you have indicated, this case is -- there would be an actual connection.               Now, you may have, as you suggest, problems with proof or -- or evidence; but, as a practical matter, I'm just wondering how often the question we're concerned about arises.                  But I mean the interesting thing is that you're -- the cases where this is going to arise is not where you're really worried about the explosives; it's going to -- because in that case, presumably there is going to be a relation, and you can use it as you used it in this case. The cases where this is going to be problematic is when you are really interested in the underlying felony.                     You know, the guy who's driving in his car and calls his broker and is guilty of insider trading and has some firecrackers in the trunk, you're not worried about the firecrackers, but you want to crack down on the insider trading.                  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Attorney General, you have 14 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. MICHAEL B. MUKASEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                     Counsel, could I ask you, do you have an answer to your friend's point about the "in which" language?                     I understood his point to be that it's surprising that they refer to use of the explosives or carrying of the explosives with reference to the underlying felony, "in which" the - suggests that the explosive was used or carried with respect to the underlying felony. And I understood your position to be that it doesn't have to be.

07-474 +++$+++                      We'll argument next in Case 07-474, Engquist v. Oregon Department of Agriculture. Mr. Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  So that what you do in this case -- I mean the person is fired and that's all you know.    And so you go back and see:               Well, is there any possible reason?           So you look at the time sheets.    Oh, here are a few days where she punched in late.    That's a possible reason, and that's enough?                   So in that case -- and then let's say you're at trial, and you ask:                    Did you fire this person because she punched in late a few times?     I take it hat the objection would be that that's irrelevant, and that would be sustained.                   No, no.   The record shows she was -- a few times she punched in late.                  But you're going to have to articulate it in Federal court.                 You emphasize it's a deferential standard, it's not -- but every case now -- every case of an employee firing, in fact every case of employee not getting as big a raise as he thought he was entitled, that's now a Federal case.                  But Title VII, there's no --you know, there is no, "because you don't like me," it's not because I'm a particular race or --                  I'm not worried about a frequent filer.        I'm worried about 40 million single filers.                  Can I ask you more -- perhaps a more abstract question about this class-of-one? Doesn't that have the effect of adding an equal protection claim to every violation of law?                  In other words, you have a Fourth Amendment search and seizure claim, and you're treated illegally; you say well, everybody else was treated legally and I wasn't, so it's an equal protection violation?                  You get -- you know, the zoning ordinance, it was improper under the zoning law, and because everybody else was properly treated, it's a violation of equal protection.                    Thank you, Ms. Blatt. Mr. Katyal, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  What is your answer to their Batson analogy?                  No, but you're adding the class aspect.        If the rationale of the prosecutor is, I don't like this person, under Batson you don't get to bring an equal protection challenge to that.

PINCUS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  I take it your position is that there's no ambiguity in the way the term is used in the statute, as opposed to no ambiguity in some abstract sense?                  I'm sorry.       Where -- the plain language dictates the result, where do I see that?                  If -- if they say that the plain language of the statute dictates a particular result, I say -- I suspect that that's a concession we are in Chevron step one, rather than two.

I mean, it is not at all unreasonable, if you have a clash between two ethnic groups in a particular country, that the interpreters are going to have views one way or the other.

Well, you might be right, but, you know, with respect to standing we have held that that is an issue-by-issue inquiry, not a live case broadly conceived.

07-513 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument first today in Case 07-513 , Herring v.                United States. Miss Karlan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Didn't they have some regular system for updating the computer base?                   I mean, I assume it was updated at some point.                  So people who are, you know, the warrant is served, they're arrested, they go to trial, they're in jail, their name still shows up as having a warrant out for their arrest.                  Well then, how did this warrant clerk, I guess is what I'd call her, discover the error?     She discovered it within 10 or 15 minutes, right.                  Why did the first -- first person in that scenario need a physical copy of the warrant?                     Well, there was something done in this particular case, though, right? The warrant clerk notified -- was it the Coffee County people?                   -- that the warrant -- that the information she had given 10 minutes before was inaccurate.                  How is it going to keep --                     It's a separate question.   It may be an illegal arrest, but the question is the separate one of whether or not you exclude the evidence collected incident to that arrest.                      And we have, in several cases, separated the two questions, and I guess it's difficult for me to see if no one has done anything wrong, no one, why you would suppress the evidence in that case.                     No, but you have this difficulty:     Do we have to get into negligence, or should we assume, as I understand to be your theory, as Justice Breyer put it, that you would still suppress the evidence when no one has done anything wrong?                  Well, that's just rephrasing it.   It's probable cause based on the existence of a warrant, and it turns out to be there is a mistake in the warrant.                    So, you would impose a burden on the officer on the street serving a warrant? When he gets the call saying there's a warrant, he's supposed to say, "Are you sure?               Did you double-check with the clerk?    When was the last time they updated the computer system?    I don't want to go through all this if the evidence is going to be suppressed."                    At every chain in command, you would impose that burden.                    Yes, but I mean I don't know what the situation is like --                    I don't know what the situation is like in Dale County.                    They probably don't have the latest version of WordPerfect, or whatever it is.    They are probably making do with whatever they can under their budget and doing the best they can.                  Well, you said this wasn't anything in the record about what type of program they might have, whether they were updated.                  They found the mistake in ten minutes.                    Sure.                    But the Coffee County people aren't called "support officers" for the Dale County police.                    Now you keep saying this when you did this in your brief.                  You just call everybody "police," "police," "police," when the question is whether there's a distinction between the Coffee County police and the Dale County police for purposes of applying the exclusionary rule.                    So you are back to arguing that there was negligence, and that that's pertinent.                   Not the procedures of the police.    The officer is on the stand and you say, all right, you've been here a while, how many times have these warrants turned out to be wrong, just as simple as it was in this case?       And he says, gosh, this is the first time that I've had this question.                   Okay.     Cross-examine people.    These people are under oath, you cross-examine. You say, I don't think that's right.                     How many times? It's not that big a deal to find out on what basis the arresting officer was acting.                   So that's assuming bad faith on the part of the police.                   They want to arrest him, so they follow him until they find a motor vehicle violation.                   But you're suggesting it's bad faith --                   -- because they -- because they don't want to have to worry about getting a warrant that might be wrong?                   What was your point then?   You're saying, well, they want to get this guy and they don't have to go through the warrant or anything else.    They can follow him, find the broken taillight and then they would have gotten that guy.                    I thought that was the point you were trying to make?                    Sure.
07-526 +++$+++                     We'll hear argument next in Case 07-526, Carcieri v. Kempthorne. Mr. Olson. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                      What about -- what about the additional definition in section 19 of "tribe," which is not limited the way the first sentence is?                   My understanding -- maybe I've got this wrong, but there was not then, as there is now, a list of tribes that are recognized and under Federal jurisdiction.              So how -- how do you tell in 1934 who is under Federal jurisdiction?                   But I guess the point is that, given the weight that you are placing on the word "now," you would think there was some clear way to say who was recognized before then and who was recognized after that.         And I -- I just don't know what the test of recognition was in 1934. But if they were drawing -- if Congress were drawing a sharp line, presumably, it would be based on a sharp distinction; and, yet, as I understand it, there is no real sharp distinction.                  No.   No.   No. That's not true, because now you have a very clear system.   You are recognized if you are on the list.                   If you don't -- you know, maybe you shouldn't be on the list; maybe you should be.           But you are recognized if you are on the list.       That wasn't the case in 1934.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                    Mr. Verrilli, your argument is based on improper administration of the protocol.   You agree that if the protocol is properly followed there is no risk of pain?                   I thought your expert -- I'm looking at page 493 to 494 of the joint appendix -- agreed that if the two grams of sodium pentothal is properly administered, the way he put it, in virtually every case there would be a humane death.                  That method has never been tried, correct.                  Do we know whether there are risks of pain accompanying that method?                  The record establishes that the second drug that's used here is used to prevent involuntary muscle contractions.                  That would not be -- there wouldn't be a safeguard against that under one drug protocol, I take it.                     Can you -- do you agree that that is an appropriate problem to be addressed by the execution protocol, that they should try to reduce the likelihood of involuntary muscle contractions?                     I think that their -- one of their reasons was that it would enhance the dignity, not only of the procedure as a whole, but also to the condemned.                    What do we do with the -- if you prevail here, and the next case is brought by someone subject to the single drug protocol and their claim is:   Look this has never been tried.                    We do know that there's a chance that it would cause muscle contractions that would make my death undignified.                     It will certainly extend how long it takes to die, so I'm subject to a lingering death and the more humane protocol would be the three drug protocol?                    You have objections that would apply even to your single drug protocol.                      You tell us that one reason this challenged protocol doesn't work is because people will mix the drugs in the wrong way, including the sodium pentathol.                    That objection would still be there if we adopted your alternative, wouldn't it?                    I'm focusing specifically on the mixing of the drugs.                    The mixing of the sodium pentathol would be undertaken under the Kentucky procedure and under your proposed alternative, correct?                   Thank you Mr. Garre.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMY FRIEDLANDER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   It seems to me that you're arguing one of two things:                First, that there was no error at all under Stromberg; or second, that if there was error, it was harmless error.                 And I thought the case was about whether or not the Ninth Circuit erred in concluding that harmless error analysis didn't apply to a Stromberg error.                     Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shah. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER                      Suppose it's not, in the abstract anyway, necessarily true that this case follows a fortiori, because here, at least you have a valid theory.     That may make it a harder case, because the jury had based its entire verdict on an invalid theory. It may be more difficult than a situation where you've got a theory of the case that is invalid because a particular element is missing.                   And you can look and see whether or not that was harmless or not.                   Well, I guess, though, the point is when you have invalid and valid theories, it would be a little harder than Neder, because they don't have to make any findings under the valid theory.    You know, because you don't just have to fill in a missing piece of the puzzle, as in Neder.                   You have to -- they might have been working on an entirely different puzzle.                   So what we are talking about, in other words, is the application of harmless error, which may or may not be harder in the multiple theory case, and not the question of whether harmless error analysis should be applied.

Something along the lines of saying our studies show that light cigarettes are healthier for you, and in fact their studies show the opposite.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL SALVATORE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   Just so I'm clear --                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Salvatore, you have four minutes remaining.

07-582 +++$+++                   We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-582, Federal Communications Commission versus Fox Television Stations. Mr. Garre.      Solicitor General Garre. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   Do you think, in terms of our legal review, it makes a difference whether it's a change or whether it's a continuation of a prior policy?                  I guess my question is, do you think a different legal standard applies when an agency changes a prior position as opposed to articulating its position for the first time?                   I suppose the most difficult case for you is the "Early News" case where you have just a fleeting expletive, unlike "Saving Private Ryan" and the others.            I mean, how do you distinguish the "Early News" case from the ones before us?                   So the same -- if you had a news report about Nicole Richey and the Cher exhibits, they -- they could use the actual language, even though they can't during the -- the awards shows?                   But that is an entirely voluntary -- I mean, the Commission would have no objection if the F-Word were used on a regular basis after 10:00 o'clock?                   Well, I suppose the broadcasters' own voluntary determination not to use that -- that language 24 hours is a reflection of what they think about community standards.                  Still, I gather that's at issue with the constitutional questions.                   Does that still have the same force today when the broadcast medium is only one of several that are -- that are available?   In other words, it seems to me that the Commission might not be accomplishing terribly much if it regulates a particular medium when all sorts of other media, media, are available that don't have the Commission's oversight.                   Thank you, Mr. Phillips. General Garre you have two minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
07-588 +++$+++                      We will hear argument first today in Case 07-588, Entergy Corporation v. Riverkeeper Incorporated, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Joseffer. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER ON BEHALF OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, ET AL., SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS                  Of course, in the other provision it specifically required consideration of costs and benefits and it didn't do so in this provision.                   But just to get back to your television hypothetical, if you told somebody that you were going to buy the best TV available nobody would think you meant that you were going to buy a very cheap TV because, considering the costs and benefits, that was the best one.       They would think you are going to get the fanciest TV you could.                      Thank you, counsel. Ms. Mahoney. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                     Thank you, counsel.                    Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Joseffer, you have four minutes remaining.

07-591 +++$+++                       We'll hear argument next in Case 07-591, Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts. Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  You say -- you say "the analyst."    I suppose it doesn't have to be the analyst but whoever they decide to call.                    So if you had a supervisor who runs the cocaine testing lab and he is the one whose report is submitted, I take it he is the one who would have to show up.                  No.   No.   No.   No, I'm saying that he would testify, I guess:                    I run the lab, these are the people I hire, they know you how to do these tests, and this guy did the test.                    And since he was the one that the Government decided to -- on whose affidavit they decided to rely, that's the only person you could get. Now, you could -- to impeach him, you say, well, did you do the test?            No.      But you say, well -- but I mean you don't have a right to an analyst at a particular level.                   Well, a good defense lawyer would love to have the guy there.                      The first thing you say is:     Do you remember testing Mr. Diaz's sample?     The guy is going to say no.                   Just as was pointed out, I, you know, test thousands of samples. Well, how long have you been working with the lab?                        You know, just what -- what was your scientific background? When did you -- how does this test work?                      You put three drops of the acid in there.              It turns color, whatever it does.     How do you know that?           What is the chemical?           I mean, you spend three hours with the guy until the jury just doesn't think there is anything to the case at all.                   You're talking about the defendants or the lawyers?                  How do we know that this was prepared in contemplation of litigation?                  I mean, let's suppose the lab occasionally does analyses for other -- research purposes.               They get a sample, they want to know what it's -- they want to test it, however they do it.    Are we just assuming that it's prepared in contemplation of litigation because it usually is, or -- you can imagine a situation where the analyst really has no idea, other than perhaps supposition, why he is being asked to test the sample.                  Well, the question is it could be law enforcement purposes to test it for the police to use and educational programs that want the rookies to know what the cocaine looks like.                   So -- I'm sorry.   Go ahead.                   Thank you.                   Thank you counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Fisher. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
07-6053 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument next in Case 07-6053, Giles versus California. Ms. Burkhardt. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARILYN G. BURKHARDT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    There was a dying declaration rule at the common law; wasn't there?                  Well, that didn't require any inquiry into the intent of the person responsible for the death, or the imminent death, right?                  Well, if the dying declaration rule didn't require intent, why should yours?                   Under the -- the testimony of someone who heard her say something, was that admissible?                   No.      No.   Under the common law.                   Like in the case of an unavailable witness?                  How do we know in this case that part of his intent was not to prevent her from testifying at trial?         I mean, it's obvious that he was upset about something else, but maybe in his mind he is saying, oh, boy, if she has talked to people about how I'm going to kill her, I'd better do it so that she can't testify.                  How are we ever going to know that in a typical case?                    Well, take a case like this, I don't understand how that finding could have been made.     He knew that she had reported -- that she had said to her friends he is going to kill me; he is going to kill me.        And then he figures he'd better do it or it's going to -- his self-defense claim is going to look a lot weaker.                    No, I'm sorry it doesn't.   It means that that may have been part of his motive, to kill her.        Because I'm not just going to beat her up this time; I'm actually going to kill her because otherwise I'm going up the river.                  Here he gets a great benefit from murdering her which is that her testimony is not available.     We usually under our system don't try to give benefits to murderers.                  I understand that, and you've said --                  Excuse me, Counsel. You've said that already.            And what I'm saying is that I don't understand under the legal standard we might adopt, how that sort of finding makes sense.                     I mean, you don't ask him why did you kill her; was it to prevent her testimony or not?               That's not available in the inquiry.    So how can that sort of factual finding be made?                   Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Burkhardt, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARILYN G. BURKHARDT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
07-608 +++$+++                    We'll hear argument next in Case 07-608, United States v. Hayes. Ms. Saharsky. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  Counsel, I understand your objection to the reading that your friend would have us adopt, but you have the same sort of problem.    I mean, you've got a -- if it reads the way you would have it, then the word "that" after "an offense that" doesn't quite work, and have you to add "is" before "is committed," if you're going to keep the "that."   So it seems to me that this doesn't work grammatically either way.                   But you've changed the word.     You read it as if it says "an offense that committed."     So either the "that" is out or you've got to add the word "is."                   Okay.   You use the word "that" in the first example, but you skip the word "that" in the second.        "That" appears in the line and then comes (i) and (ii).           In other words, that modifies both of them, and you're reading it that it's an offense committed, and yet under the statute it has to be an "offense that committed."            So you've either got to leave "that" out the second time but not the first or you've got to add the word "is" as it appears in (i).                    Romanette?                    I've never heard that before.   That's -- Romanette. (Laughter.)                   How do you -- I'm sorry.   I'm not following why "element" is singular. The argument on the other side, I understood, is that the element is the use of physical force committed by a current or former spouse.          So "element" is still singular.   I -- maybe I'm missing something.               What change would you have to make to the word "element" to adopt their reading?                   Well, but I thought the whole point of this was to get at violence committed by a family member, and if that's the critical element, you don't have to have two different elements, "violence" and then "committed."              It's violence committed by a family member.                   If we think that there are two awkward readings, yours and your friend's, and both of them require surgery, don't we resolve that under the rule of lenity?                   There was a small, a small number.     Were they populous States?                   California, New York?                  Well, it seems there is no Federal misdemeanor that covers this particular type of assault, in other words?                   Right.                   Well, how does that relate to the rule of lenity?            I suppose, to get back to Justice Kennedy's point, you're saying that the lawyer would not only be obligated to read this, but in advising his client would be obligated to go back and read the drafting history and the legislative history. Do we really use those types of materials to trump the -- the rule of lenity?                     So the lawyer advising his client in the typical assault case is supposed to know at the time that only 17 States had this type of provision?                   Ms. Saharsky, six minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Well, if I could stop you there.    The very first sentence in the United States Code, 1 U.S.C. section 1, says the singular includes the plural.                    I know, but basically what you're saying is we don't follow 1 U.S.C. section 1 because our reading is correct.                 If they said, well, it doesn't -- you know, in context it doesn't fulfill the purposes and therefore we read "element" as singular only rather than according to section 1 of the United States Code.                   And, again, not to beat a dead horse, but it's footnote 8 of your brief on page 23 that lists the 17 States.                They include California, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Virginia.                 That wouldn't be a useless act by Congress to cover everybody in those States.                   I know, but you point was this doesn't do any good because it's only 17 States.   Those are -- there are a lot of people in those States.
07-610 +++$+++                      We will hear argument next in Case 07-610, Locke v. Karass. Mr. Young. ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. JAMES YOUNG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                  Even though -- even though there may be a great disconnect between the premiums and the needs of the particular unit?                  I mean, let's say the particular unit has -- I don't know -- has always had a history of good relations with the employer.   It has never had to call upon litigation in 20 years, and they don't anticipate it, and yet their insurance premiums rise dramatically because of very hostile and extended litigation by another unit.               Do you -- do you concede that case?                    He is not trying to help you. (Laughter.)                   I thought the distinction you were drawing was whether or not the collective bargaining agreement applies to the particular union.    If it's a different unit with a different agreement I thought you were saying that that can't be charged, but if it's the bargaining agreement that binds the particular unit, I thought you said that was chargeable.                   Of the particular unit.                   And I suppose you would also concede that if the bargaining agreement is exactly the same, you know a number of units have exactly the same bargaining agreement, which I would suppose is a not uncommon situation, but litigation with respect to the terms of the bargaining agreement even though it happens to involve a different unit is also chargeable to the particular unit.                   Thank you, Mr. Collins. Mr. Young, you have four minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF W. JAMES YOUNG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                  The test is not whether it's political, is it?              It's not a negative test.   It's an affirmative requirement in which the burden is on the union that they have to show the expenditure is germane to the particular collective bargaining agreement?                  Well, do you have a response to Justice Kennedy's concern?                  Do you have a fallback position or are you also in the all or nothing --
07-615 +++$+++                      We will hear argument next in Case 07-615, Ministry of Defense and Support For the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran versus Elahi. Mr. Bederman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Well, they could have agreed that they have a bank account somewhere and any amounts would be set off by that.                  That wouldn't make that bank account at issue with respect to their claim.                   So it doesn't matter that Iran recognizes that this would be used to set off a judgment it might obtain, because you just said, well they could -- a bank account could be used to set it off and that's not sufficient.                  That's the -- that's the only basis for your argument?                 I thought it was a broader suggestion that these are, to some extent, substitute assets for the assets that are at issue?                   Can you -- can you articulate a general test in a sentence or two about how you decide whether particular assets are at issue?                   Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Bederman, you have two minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. DAVID J. BEDERMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
07-636 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument next in Case 07-636, Kennedy v. The Plan Administrator for DuPont Savings and Investment Plan. Mr. Furlow. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. FURLOW ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                    I'm sorry; six weeks before what?                    Well, but how does the plan know that?                    But the plan terms say that if you want to change the beneficiary, here's how you've got to change the beneficiary; and we are going to pay the beneficiary until it's changed.                  I would have thought your friend on the other side would be quoting that language.                  But that's -- that's a bit of a stretch, isn't it?            It says no beneficiary designation is in effect.         If you look at the plan, he's got a beneficiary designation.                    It's in the opinion of the company.   That sounds -- and this is a plan -- as we've said often in ERISA cases, we want to enforce these according to the terms of the plan because the companies don't have to set these up at all.              So it makes perfect sense for the company to say, well, if we think this, then we can do this.              So, in other words, there's a doubt and we don't want to give it to somebody who might not end up being the person, but if we don't think there's a doubt, that's it.                   Well, of course you only think the Solicitor General is right so far to a certain extent.                   Then you throw them under the train because you don't -- you certainly don't think they are correct by saying, look, the only way you can do this is by modifying the plan.                   I still don't know how the plan administrator is supposed to know that the person whose name appears on the plan documents, which the plan participant can change at any time, isn't the person that they are supposed to send the benefits to.   Now, you tell me here they knew about the divorce and all that stuff.     Maybe, maybe not.               But we are trying to develop a rule for all cases and it seems to me the easiest, most administrable rule is to say whoever's name appears there gets the money, and if they are not supposed to because of some collateral dispute, well, they can sort that out in litigation.                  Maybe Kari has a suit against Mrs. Kennedy or her estate, but that's not a matter for the plan to worry about.                  I must have missed -- where did Watergate come from. (Laughter.)                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Furlow, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DAVID A. FURLOW ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                     They look at it and say, is this a QDRO?        And if no, then they go back to the other provision, I guess on page 21a in the red brief, and say:    If it's not a QDRO, ignore it.                   Do you have anything more to say on the plan document, the plan document issue than what you've said here.

I mean, the more you say that the monument is Government speech to get out of the first, free speech -- the Free Speech Clause, the more it seems to me you're walking into a trap under the Establishment Clause.                      If it's Government speech, it may not present a free speech problem, but what is the Government doing speaking -- supporting the Ten Commandments?                   Mr. Sekulow --                   -- when you come upon this, if somebody comes upon this monument in the park, how are they supposed to tell whether it's Government speech or private speech?

07-689 +++$+++                  We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-689, Bartlett v. Strickland. Mr. Browning. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                  How can you say that this brings us closer to a situation where race will not matter when it expands the number of situations in which redistricting authorities have to consider race?                  It seems to me to be a criticism of the majority-minority district approach in the first place.                  What about influence districts?                  Do you move -- you've moved from majority-minority to crossover districts.   Should you continue to move to so-called influence districts?                   Well, I would have thought the possibility of coalition districts would be evidence that the Voting Rights Act has succeeded, rather than evidence that you need to apply it more broadly.                  Well, I mean, the obvious question when you say 15 to 30 percent is what number of crossover voters would you say demonstrates that you no longer need to consider race in shifting a coalition district?                  Of course, it could be 70 percent that don't vote for a particular candidate.   At some point you have to conclude that it's based on the candidate rather than on race.                     What is the answer? What percentage of crossover voting would make this not actionable under section 2?                     So you don't have an answer to Justice Alito's question? (Laughter.)                   Under your theory, it would be possible to challenge a majority-minority district on the ground that you could draw a different coalition district, maybe more than one coalition district.   Let's put it that way. If you could draw a majority-minority district and you could draw two crossover districts, does the Voting Rights Act impose a limit on the choice?                     That's an easy -- I suspect that's a common hypothetical.                     You could draw a district with 80 percent minority voters or you could have, as you have here, two 40 percent districts.                     And the Voting Rights Act requires what?                   We are fighting over -- the district that you want to draw, the crossover district, would have 39 percent African-American voters.           The district that complied with State law of the county line would have 35 percent. Where the assumption is that you have a significant degree of crossover voting, is that really a difference worth changing the Voting Rights Act jurisprudence for?                   What do you mean by "workable"?                   Because it's 4 percent less than the district you propose?                   So it gets back to the Justice Scalia's point --                   -- that this is designed to protect incumbents.                  Thank you Mr. Joseffer.

07-6984 +++$+++                    We will hear argument next in Case 07-6984, Jimenez v. Quarterman. Mr. Goldstein. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                      So, does your position depend upon the proposition that we are not free to consider sort of a second direct appeal as part of the collateral review process?                      I guess it doesn't -- or does it really make a difference?                      I mean, if you view the direct appeal that is the result of the collateral review process as part of the collateral review process, that time is tolled.                     And if you take your view and regard it as not final to trigger the process until you have another final decision, it kind of leads to the same result, doesn't it?                  But does that really matter?   I mean, the whole purpose of the Federal statute of limitations is to make sure these things get done within one year.       And if he waits a year before filing, then he's out of time under AEDPA.                  Right.                   Oh, but is that right?     I mean unless you count, as I gather your friends on the other side would do, the period of direct appeal as part of the collateral review process?                    What about the State convicting, penalizing the defendant despite the fact that his constitutional right to competent counsel was -- he lost that right because of the failure of notification?                   Is this just a dispute about the label?         Because Texas chooses to call the proceeding that you get if you are successful on collateral review a second direct appeal, you would count finality one way; if they just switch the label and say that is the collateral review appeal process, then you would agree with them?                  Well, except that you kind of elide the point that Congress and AEDPA quite clearly wanted these federal claims to be brought within a year.   This seems to allow the State processes to trump the one-year requirement.                   You said that it's unusual for the Texas State to grant these.                      But presumably you could challenge the determination five, ten, 15 years later by the Texas court not to grant you a direct appeal.                   Yeah.   Let's say this fellow -- the State court says, well, you know what, we are not going to give you another direct appeal.    And he says, well, that decision was made in violation of my federal constitutional rights.                     What happens then with respect to federal habeas?                   But is he challenging the first conviction, or is he challenging the failure of the State court to give him another direct appeal?                     Well, that's I gather if he is granted the collateral -- the direct -- second direct appeal.        What if the Court says no, we don't agree that you were denied your right to a direct appeal; we think you had it so you don't get another one.   And he says that determination has been made in violation of the Federal Constitution.                     Well, doesn't it depend upon the allegation he wishes to make?                   Say he comes in in one of these proceedings four and a half years later and says, you should give me another direct review, I didn't have it.            And the court says, well, no, we're not going to give you one.                 And he says, well, you give it to all the white criminal defendants and you are not giving it to me, so that violates equal protection?                      I guess my hypothetical supposes a new constitutional violation. And I am just suggesting that the fact that Texas doesn't grant this relief freely doesn't mean that that's a sufficient answer with respect to the abuse of federal habeas.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER STIRBA, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                    Well, because the Fourth Amendment principle of consent was well established?   In other words, if a police officer goes to the door and says "May I come in," that is -- that is perfectly acceptable.      Is that -- that the level of generality that you think we ought to analyze this issue at?                  Counsel, in every -- given the posture of the ultimate issue in this case on the underlying constitutional question, you do not have to prove that you are right; isn't that correct?                  You have to establish that the contrary principle is not clearly established?                     Thank you, counsel.                     Mr. Stewart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS                   Why isn't it -- why isn't it an advisory opinion, if we do not have to decide -- to decide the ultimate question whether this is constitutional or not, but simply whether or not it was clearly established whether it was unconstitutional? Why isn't it purely an advisory opinion to say whether it's constitutional or not?                   No, no.     Those are different grounds, it seems to me.                 Those are two independent, as you said.          Here it's kind of a -- it's a progression.   You first ask, either, under somebody's view, I guess, Saucier, whether or not it's constitutional or not and then whether it's clearly established. I just don't know why the first question isn't purely advisory, because you don't have to know whether it's constitutional or not.                   Thank you, counsel.

NEWSOM ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT                    It's pretty hard to argue something wasn't in force and effect when they have an election under it, isn't it?                   So if the circuit court had gotten the State law right, then there never would have been an election?                  Now, counsel, since you mentioned section 5, perhaps you ought to look at it.   It says that you have to preclear standards, practices, whatever, different from that in force or effect on November 1st, 1964. Now, the Respondents in their brief accused you of making the argument that since this isn't different from what was in effect in 1964 you don't have to preclear it.   And you said, no, that's not what we're saying; we take no position on that. Why in the world did you say that?                It says quite clearly the standard has to be different from that in force or effect on November 1st, '64.                At that point these people were appointed.                   Well, in your reply brief on page 8 you say you take no position on that question.                  Well, there wouldn't be a different baseline for judicial changes than there would be for legislative or executive changes, would there?                  What about Ms. Karlan's response that this is not the same practice but it's different because the underlying method of election has been changed.

COLLINS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   But you think it was right?                   It doesn't -- your point is that it doesn't go to the "aiding" issue.                     But even, again, I think you are taking on too high a burden.                 You don't have to show that the jury properly understood it.                 You don't even have to show that it's reasonable. You have to show the opposite -- or your friend has to show the opposite, that there is no way that the jury could have understood this correctly or applied the correct constitutional law.            That is, if there is a way, then it's -- it's not objectively unreasonable.                   Mr. Collins, you have four minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. COLLINS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
07-773 +++$+++                   We will hear argument next in Vaden v. Discover Bank. Mr. Ortiz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                     That simply means that you can't bring an action in Federal court because the agreement says you can't.              The agreement says you've got to arbitrate.    So if you throw the agreement out save for such agreement, the question is whether or not you could then bring the action in Federal court.                    This is a tough -- it's a tough sell.      When you say "save for such agreement," which I agree with Justice Stevens seems to me you've put the agreement aside and then you say right away then you look at the agreement to see if there is Federal jurisdiction and only the agreement, not through that.   So you're throwing it out and then you bring it right back in.   It seems --                    Of the arbitration agreement?                   Right.   And I guess it's -- I mean, you say if it said save for the historic doctrine of ouster, then it would be easy to say, and then you look at the arbitration agreement.                  But it says "save for such agreement" and then you look at the agreement.                  But you do think -- you do think we should look through to determine diversity and the amount in question?                   In other words, not in the Federal-question context, but if it's diversity, you say we do look through the arbitration agreement.                  Can I hold up just a second to make sure I understand it.                     You are saying that, let's say, Person A has an arbitration agreement that implicates Persons B and C.                C is diverse, but B is not.   They could decide to compel arbitration with respect to B and leave C out of it.                      But if you follow the look-through doctrine, you would say, well, the dispute is between A and B and C; and so you would be depriving A of their right to frame their own complaint in a way that doesn't create Federal jurisdiction.                   Of course, I suppose how that works depends on what the rules are about how you frame the dispute once you do look through. I mean, if there is a pending State suit between A and B, even though C may -- you could have sued C as well, I mean the judge can say, well, I am only going to look through to what the -- the actual litigation is; and if I look at that, that's not a Federal case.   And -- and -- and so your position follows.                    Yes, and what really leapt off the page at me in that opinion, he gets to the end, I think he basically presents your position and then he says:    Thus, on my reading the relevant portion of section 4 could be rewritten this way. Well, I mean that to me is a confession of error if you have to rewrite the statute to get to your position.                  Well, his rewriting doesn't look very much like section 4 to me.                   Thank you, counsel.                   Thank you, Mr. Phillips.    Mr. Ortiz, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   I'm sorry, what do you mean would still be covered?                   Which would still be in Federal court.
07-8521 +++$+++                      We will hear argument this afternoon in Case 07-8521, Harbison v. Bell. Ms. Chavis. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANA C. HANSEN CHAVIS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                      Your interpretation would make all of the provisions of subsection (e) applicable in state proceedings, so long as there's been a 2254 petition filed?                   I'm sorry.    Where are you reading, the first part, "available post-conviction process"?                   Well, that doesn't modify what comes before it, does it?                   New trial, appeals?   In other words, if at the end of the habeas proceeding things start all over then presumably the appointed counsel represents the defendant throughout all those new proceedings?                  I'm sorry.   I'm sure I'm missing something here, because the statute does say "all available post-conviction process."                  So you're just saying a new trial because you succeed on habeas is not post-conviction process?                  Well then, if you look up earlier in the statute, it says "shall represent the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceeding."                  Why doesn't it fall under that?                   No, no, no.    That doesn't work.   The language you just quoted is simply to say when you get somebody appointed.                   You are financially unable so you get somebody appointed.                    Then you go back and say that person shall represent you through every subsequent stage.    It doesn't say that, oh, if you suddenly get somebody else appointed, you know, then you can -- then he doesn't have that obligation.                  Well, then why don't we interpret the clemency provision the same way, as being limited to Federal?                  But then the use of "Federal" -- we were just talking about.                  I don't know why you just didn't take the position and say, yes, it applies to all these provisions.         That doesn't seem to me a -- to doom your position at all.             Once have you somebody appointed who helps you on the Federal habeas -- presumably they do a lot of work, they get up to speed on everything -- they ought to represent you through the next stage of available proceedings.                  Well, you see why -- I mean, if you say, well, the first part is implicitly only federal, that makes it very hard for you to argue that the second part is not also implicitly only federal.                   If you step back and look at the structure, it seems to me unusual that your interpretation would be correct.                It seems to me that it would be more likely that Congress wanted this counsel to continue on in State proceedings, trials. The clemency thing seems a little bit more removed.    It's a different argument -- you know, we're guilty, but show us mercy -- than what may well be the same sort of argument on the subsequent State proceeding as was raised in the Federal habeas.                    I mean, if I were writing this, I would want them to continue in the subsequent State proceedings before I would want them to continue -- before I would want to have them represent the defendant in clemency.                     It says "adequate representation."   And then later on it says the lawyers we appoint here has to have five years of experience, three years experience in felony trials.                   I think that is a lot better than most of the attorneys who are going to be appointed under the State system.                   So I would say: Look, this statute itself recognizes that this person you have appointed under the State system is not adequate.   They say you have got to have five years/three years, so I want one of those.                   You put a lot of weight on -- I mean, the problem arises because Congress did not specify whether it was limited to federal or state.     And yet you are saying they were -- what they clearly meant to do when they said "executive or other clemency" was to signal implicitly that it must cover state because there is no other kind of clemency.                       It's -- it's kind of a real round-about way to make that point, isn't it?                  Somebody's not going to sit there and say, oh, we put "other" in because we know that in the federal system it's only executive, but in the State system there might be others.                  That guy wouldn't suddenly say, well, maybe we should say this is meant to cover the State system.                   Thank you, Mr. Jay. MS. CHAVIS, you have a minute left.

I think you have the flip side of the same problem your friend has.                    In other words, the further it is removed from the constitutional violation or an allegation of a constitutional violation, the less need there is for immunity.                   The closer it is or the closer we must assume it is to a constitutional violation, then the immunity argument is stronger.                   Thank you, counsel.

07-869 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument next in Case 07-869, Ysursa v. Pocatello Education Association. Mr. Smith. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLAY R. SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                    I think Justice Stevens's question highlights for me one of the confusing parts of this case.             You sort of paired off a number of the people who would otherwise be covered, and you are left with the county employees.                       If you had started with the county employees, is this how you would have gone about telling them they can't do this? I mean the county employers.            Would you have passed a law saying that the county employers are not allowed to have this checkoff?     If you think they are part of the State, I guess you could have just written them a letter and say don't do this, right?                   Yes, because the State couldn't --                    No other organization other than the Federal, State and local governments.                  Are there other areas in which the State exercises the authority you're asserting here with respect to county employers, telling them what they can and can't do?                  I mean more generally.   Your assertion is that this is part of the State, and therefore, as I gather, it's conceded on the other side, this is acceptable with respect to State employees but not other public employers.                     Are there other areas in which you act like the counties are part of the State?                    I'm looking for --                    I'm looking for a specific example.    I mean, maybe counties or municipalities, you know, contract for trash collection or water services and maybe the State tells them, look, you've got to deal with these people, you've got to do it by open bidding, whatever.                  Well, that's -- since I asked the question, I think it's necessary.                    So what's the best example where the State exercises control over what the counties would otherwise have discretion to do?    You mentioned school districts.                  Is that -- is that an area?                  I -- I didn't hear you.   You think that's what?                   That depends -- I mean the whole case turns on -- and the response to Justice Kennedy, I think, would be -- if the Federal Government is simply saying you can do it if you want, that's one thing.    If the Federal Government is saying you must do it because it's covered by the Federal Power Act, or whatever, that's different. If it's just a grant of permission, I would suppose the State can say, well, fine, it's okay with the Feds, but you can't do it because we don't want you to.

ISAACSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    And there is nothing theoretically inconsistent with the government -- you can feel remorse.    I mean, you're not going to do it again.   You going to feel remorse every time you do it, but that doesn't mean he didn't feel remorse from the crime he was pleading to.                    I suppose Justice Ginsburg's point is relevant, though, on the question of prejudice.   If the judge gets up there and says, I don't care what the government says, I am not going to give anybody a departure when they have committed another crime, then you haven't been prejudiced by the government's breach.                   It would not be cost-free for you, because if you just sit there and say, you know, the agreement is void, the government is going to say, well, fine, I will see you in court; and we will have a trial; and you are going to get twice as much as you would have gotten anyway. You have some interest, since you entered the guilty plea, in going forward with the plea.                  Well, but let's put it this way.    Maybe this is the same question anyway. Let's say it is the same facts as we have here but instead of saying, I can't do this, the judge says, I'm going to do this.    And, look, I think you are remorseful.    I'm going to give you three points.                   And that's all you agreed with the government.                     The government says we'll recommend it, and the judge says, well, you're going to get it anyway.                     I think you should get it.   The agreement has still been breached, right? The government didn't recommend.                  So in that situation, you think you can withdraw the agreement?                  Well --                      Thank you, counsel.

LEVEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   But would it have to be -- would it have to be structural error?                   I -- I don't know why you don't argue that it's structural error when the error is a wrongful denial of a peremptory challenge, because it is impossible for you to establish the harmfulness of error because, as Justice Scalia pointed out, a peremptory challenge is just a hunch on your part; you don't need any more.                    But if it's something like he was in Dupage County rather than Cook County, maybe that's something where it's fair to put the burden of showing harmfulness on the defendant.                   Well, maybe that's true.   My point is that may be true with respect to a peremptory challenge, but it doesn't seem to me to be terribly difficult to say, well, he lives in Dupage County and not Cook County, so what's the big deal?

Well, not half.                 Well, it has to apply to individual actions as well?              What if the basis for the restriction is the additional administrative costs of a class action?       In other words, it doesn't say you can't bring it, but it says any recovery shall be reduced by 10 percent because class actions cost more than individual actions?

08-103 +++$+++                     We will hear argument next in Case 08-103, Elsevier v. Muchnick. Mr. Sims. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. SIMS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                    This is a lot harder case than Arbaugh, though.            Arbaugh involved the definition of an employer and then the scope of the statute.   This one says no suit shall be instituted.                   I think you are right that Arbaugh at least set forth a clear statement rule, but I think that's significant only going forward. I don't know that Congress, when it passed this provision, could have been aware of the clear statement rule that Arbaugh articulated.                  Well, if you are talking about the language, what about John R. Sand & Gravel?    That said we held it was jurisdictional when the statute said:     "Suits shall be barred."                  The language here is "No suit shall be instituted."                       That sounds pretty close.                  No, that was -- that was a statute of limitations provision, right?              It shall be barred after six years?                  We have forms for copyright infringement actions?                  Live and learn.                  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER ANDERS ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS                  Is your discussion of that, including in your response to Justice Ginsburg and in your brief, do you think that that's within the question presented, rephrased?                  Do you have an example of the non-ordinary case?                 I mean, you seem to say, either -- I guess it's not always after judgment that it shouldn't be implemented, I guess.                 But when wouldn't it be after judgment?                  So it's more -- so it's more or less jurisdictional after judgment?                    There really are, in our recent decisions, it seems to me, two different lines of authority.      There is the Bowles and the John R. Sand and Gravel, which treats these sorts of things as jurisdictional, and the Arbaugh line that doesn't.                And it does seem to me that the language here, "No suit shall be instituted," sounds an awful lot like "suit shall be barred," or the other language in -- in Bowles.

RUSSELL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   How about so and so stole a car that belonged to Mr. Jones.                   I suppose you could say that the person knew it was Mr. Jones' car, but more likely somebody stole the car that turned out to be Mr. Jones's.                   Well, that doesn't help you much because it can't be knowingly manufacture something is the crime.          I mean, you do have to go on to have that make any sense.            You don't have to go on to make your provision make any sense, that he knowingly, you know, uses a means of identification.                   No, I guess --I guess basically this is what I was trying to say earlier as well.     You have in your statute in between there, the modifier "without lawful authority."                   So that means that it can stop at a lot more number of earlier places then can the statute you were just citing in appendix D.                  Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Russell.

How much of your case depends upon the difficulty of defining what -- if you accept the idea that "in contemplation of" means abusive or fraudulent, how much of your case depends upon the proposition that it's just hard to tell, that it's -- it's a multifactored inquiry and that the lawyer sort of has to stop and think at every turn:                 Well, could this be construed as recommending abuse, or is this just construed as telling clients what they can and can't do?   And in some areas it's a gray area, and what should you do when it's a gray area? Is that -- does your case depend upon that, which is, I guess, just an issue with the limiting construction proposed by the Solicitor General?                  Thank you, Counsel.

WANSLEE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 What -- what provision was this discharge under?                 And 1328 says court shall grant a debtor a discharge."                 That doesn't sound self-executing to me.                (a), and section 523(a) does not refer to a discharge under 1328(a).                   It refers to a discharge under 1328(b).                No, no, no. 1328(a)(2) brings in the definition, the kind of debt specified in 523(a).   It doesn't bring in the discharge under 523(a), which is limited to 1328(b).                 If -- if you d like to reserve time, it's probably time to wrap up.                 Mr. Heytens. ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER                 I don't -- sorry to start -- stop you at the beginning, but I don't see that.   I see in 1328(a) it says the court  shall grant  the debtor.   And that is not self-executing.               It's a directive to the court.        And I see that 523(a) is referred to later on, but only for purposes of definition, not for purposes of discharge.                Well, then the key distinction you draw in your brief is totally meaningless.     You say on page 18 that this -- the issue is whether the provision is, quote,  framed as a directive  to the bankruptcy court.                And here it is framed as a directive to the bankruptcy court, and therefore doesn't -- isn't self-executing.                   Thank you, counsel. Ms. Wanslee, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MADELEINE C. WANSLEE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 Right.                 Well, I -- my -- I'm not -- I'm not sure it does.              It refers back to 523(a) to define the debt.     I don't think it incorporates all -- all of 523.    It's simply referring to the kind of debt that should not be discharged.

RUSSELL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   I think -- reading "intentional" the way you just articulated is absolutely right, but when you add -- I don't see what work "bona fide error" does in the statute, if "intentional" should be read in this case to mean what you say.                   But you say intentional means you meant to send out the document; you meant to serve it; in other words, no specific intent requirement.      But if -- a bona fide error, it seems, doesn't make the activity not intentional under the traditional understanding of intentional.                 But you are sort of begging the question there.            I mean, the antitrust laws also don't have a bona fide error defense, and the question is whether that includes a legal mistake defense.                  One -- one of the things you have to include on this initial communication is the name of the creditor, right?                  Okay.     So let's say the bank that is the creditor is being sold or taken over.    And, you know, you have heard that, well, they have merged, but, you know, the closing date of the merger is two months later or whatever.                    It's just not clear what the name of the creditor is.                    So you -- you are not a lawyer, but you are trying to collect the debt, and you go -- you fill in, I --                   it's either A or B, and you say:    I think it's A, and you fill it in and it turns out that it's -- it's B.                 Let's say that's a bona fide error.    Okay? But if you are sitting there as the debt collector and you say:        I don't know if it's A or B. And you say:    I know; I'll call the lawyer.                  You call the lawyer and the lawyer says:               Oh, it's -- it's B -- I mean, it's -- it's A.       And you put down A and it turns out it's wrong, aren't -- you are in a worse position if you ask the lawyer than if you didn't, right?                  No, it's a -- it's a legal -- the lawyer looks at it and says:                 Well, you know, the merger is not going to close for whatever, but I think it's still this bank.             And it turns out his legal analysis of who the creditor is was wrong.                  Yes.                  But if the client just says:    I'm not going to ask the lawyer; I'm just going to make -- I think it's A -- it's a bona fide error, but it's an error -- he gets the benefit of that position.    But if he asks the lawyer, he doesn't get the benefit.                 Who the -- who the creditor is is necessarily a mistake of law, rather than fact?                 Well, is it a mistake of fact if the lawyer does legal research to find it out?                 He looks and he says:   Well, it depends upon the date of the closing of the merger, not the announcement.                 And it turns out that's a legal mistake.                    Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Jay. ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER                 How many times have they answered in the past decade?                   So that's not a very realistic procedure to rely on, is it?                   And why is that? Because it's a little difficult dealing with the FTC bureaucracy and getting an answer from them in a reasonable time?                  So you are saying that the debt collection industry doesn't does ask the FTC, which would be a safe harbor for them, because if they get a bad answer, they may not follow it and then they may be subject to heightened penalties?                  Well, but there are four of them.   I don't care how public they are.               There are four of them over the past 10 years.                It's not a very reliable or usable effort to clarify the law and address the problem that the statute presents.                 And if that's wrong, it doesn't do you any good.

MATHIASON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                It's a tort action, right?            I suppose -- grounded in contract.      I suppose the existence of a contract is an evidentiary matter that you have to establish, but the cause of action is still tort, and of course 301(a) is limited to violations of contracts.            I don't see how somebody who is not a party to the contract can violate the contract.      They can be liable for all sorts of things, but I don't see that they can be liable for violating the contract.            I suppose you can have tortious interference with the contract.             Can you, without the -- establishing the existence of a contract?            Yes, I suppose that s --            -- tortious interference with -- what is it, the ability to enter into a contract, I think, is recognized in some jurisdictions.             I suppose it's a question for your friends on the other side whether they think the ratification or the contract that was entered into in December that s effective in May -- if that makes them liable for violating the no-strike clause, right?             So what happens if it's ratified retroactively?              Is the no-strike clause in effect?             You want to say yes, right?            Mr. Mathiason, you have 5 minutes remaining.

ELENA KAGAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            So you would say that the Federal Government has no such power independent of the criminal conviction?              In other words, that Congress could not pass a law saying, just as this one says, we are going to commit people who are sexually dangerous until a determination that they are not or until the State can take them?              That power would not be in Article I?            Right.    I understand your argument to be that this power is necessary and proper, given the fact that the person is in Federal custody for some other reason, criminal conviction.            Yes.              Well, why doesn't the Federal Government's authority to have custody because of the criminal justice system end when the criminal justice system is exhausted?                In other words, when the sentence is done?            So, if there were --            But, General --            I understood you in your response to Justice Alito to say, if I remember, that it was not just the fact of Federal custody, but the fact that there are no States or there may well often be no States willing.        What if every State is willing; I mean, every State is willing to take the people on out of a concern to protect their citizens. Does that somehow mean there s no necessary and proper power?            I guess it wouldn't be necessary, is what you are saying?              Thanks for thinking it was a promotion.

No, you don't have to -- you don't have to do that.             I guess my problem with your argument -- you say, "is required to register under SORNA."     But you can be required to register under SORNA before SORNA is enacted to the extent that SORNA is retroactive.    You ask someone:            Why are you registering?

08-1314 +++$+++        We will hear argument next in Case 08-1314, Williamson v. Mazda. Mr. Buchanan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN N. BUCHANAN, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       I thought the reason that the Solicitor General gives for not -- that NHTSA did not immediately require the type 2 seatbelt is because the costs would have been higher.     Is that your understanding?       How come allowing - or why doesn't allowing the relief you seek under State law impose those same costs, contrary to NHTSA's objective in not making those mandatory?       And a State tort action does not?       I suppose -- I understand the argument.     I'm not sure it's right, though, in the sense that NHTSA may decide not to make particular standards mandatory for reasons other than cost.     It may decide it doesn't think the technology is adequately developed.     It may decide that it doesn't think there are adequate, you know, mechanics prepared or involved. But here it's because of the cost, and the relief you are seeking it seems to me directly imposes the costs that NHTSA decided not to require.       Well, every -- there is no objective that the government pursues regardless of cost.     I understand that their objective was to encourage this, but it was clearly not to impose it, because it thought at that time that the costs were too great.     So to simply say their objective was to get these in ignores the other side of the cost/benefit analysis.       What if the rule here had another provision that said you must have Type 1?     You can have Type 2 -       You can have Type 2, right?     But we are not requiring Type 2, because we think the costs on manufacturers would be too great.     We may require it in the future, but not now. Is it the same?     Is your position the same?       Well, doesn't the - doesn't the increased costs that are imposed by the tort liability conflict with NHTSA's determination in my hypothetical that they're not requiring Type 2 because of the cost?       Well, it said all those thing in Geier, too, didn't it?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jay. ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS       No -- I agree with you, it doesn't require.     It doesn't support the inference that they did not want Type 2 seatbelts to happen, to be used. It does, in my hypothetical view, support the inference that it didn't want to mandate Type 2 seatbelts because it was worried, as you said in your brief at page 9, about the cost.     And yet its worries about the cost, it seems to me, are overridden by the position that State tort suits can go on for the absence of Type 2 seatbelts.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Buchanan, have you four minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN N. BUCHANAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       When you talk about safety to children, are you also addressing the strap going across the aisle or the strap interfering with vision?     I know that is not directly related to children, but it affects what type of belt might be the safest overall.       But state tort law doesn't, juries typically don't take into account the fleet costs of avoiding liability, which as I understand from the SG's brief in this case was the reason that Type 2 was not mandated, because of the overall costs. You have a jury with an injured plaintiff, they are not likely to weigh heavily the fact that this would cost 3 extra cents per car fleet wide.     I think that is the sort of thing NHTSA considers.
08-1322 +++$+++                     We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1322, Astrue v. Ratliff. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  So how can the court's broad equitable authority trump what you say is what the statute says?                   Do you actually have to transfer it or --                   I mean, the statute says pay the prevailing party.                   And you re saying the court can say:      No, pay the lawyer.                   In certain --                  What if the client is bankrupt?     What happens then?                   Well, but that's a fanciful answer, because EAJA requires that the government's position, to get fees, is substantially unjustified.   And so the government lawyer is going to sit down and say, well, you know, if I take a position that is substantially unjustified, I will at that point pay the fees to you, not to the client.                     Yes, but the attorney's interest -- I thought in the hypothetical we were talking about, the attorney's interest is.                     He thinks the government is going to take a substantially unjustified position, and he wants to make sure in that case that he gets paid.                  Well, that's going to look awful bad to a court that comes in and he's -- and the court is asked to award EAJA fees, and there is an agreement already in effect.               The government says, well, if we re -- you know, if we re liable for EAJA fees, this is how we are going to handle it.                  That would be the first piece of -- that would be the first piece of evidence that I would want to put in saying I should get EAJA fees.   The government thought they might even take a position that qualified.                   No, but say he goes in to the government and says, look, I m about to sue you, and I d like to sit down and negotiate a nice agreement about the repayment.                   Government lawyers are always sympathetic to people who come in and say: I'm going to sue you. (Laughter.)                   The government zeroes out, but in the course of it, it has taken a legal position in court against a small business that was substantially unjustified.                   But I think the idea -- well --                   Mr. Yang, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Counsel, do you -- do you dispute your friend's statement that 42 percent of the time in Social Security cases the government's position is unjustified, and 70 percent of the time in Veterans cases?                  So whenever it really makes a difference --   -- 70 percent of the time the government's position is substantially unjustified?                  What number would you accept?                  Well, that's really startling, isn't it?        In litigating with veterans, the government more often than not takes a position that is substantially unjustified?
08-1332 +++$+++                     We will hear argument next in Case 08-1332, the City of Ontario v. Quon. Mr. Richland. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                    The whole -- the argument here, of course, is that that was modified by the instructions he got from the lieutenant.                  Do we follow the written policy or the policy they allegedly enforced in practice?                    Well, we are dealing with Mr. Quon's reasonable expectations, right?                    And even with the written policy, he has the instructions -- everybody agrees -- you can use this pager for private communications.                    We re not going to audit them.     Right?      That's what he said.              He has to pay for them.     Right?    Now, most things, if you're paying for them, they re yours.          And this -- it particularly covered messages off-duty. Now, can't you sort of put all those together and say that it would be reasonable for him to assume that private messages were his business?                     They said he can do it.        They said, you ve got to pay for it.   He used it off duty.             They said they re not going to audit it.                    Let me ask you --                    Let me ask you to put the written policy aside.               Hypothetical case:         There s no written policy.      Would he have a reasonable expectation in the privacy of his personal e-mail, text messages, in that case?                    In other words, all we know is the list that I went through earlier.                    Yes.                    Well, that s the written policy.                  But the policy itself, from the point of view of Officer Quon, is a little bit more complicated than that.                  You would agree, I think, that if the SCA, the Stored Communications Act --                  If that made it illegal to disclose these e-mails, then he would certainly be correct that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy; isn't that right?                  It's not reasonable to assume that people are going to follow the law?                    Did your client treat on-duty text messages different from off-duty text messages?                    Why did it do that?                    Why did it treat them differently?    Under your theory, they re all the same -- no expectation of privacy.                  Well, why did -- I'm sorry.   I still don't understand.               It redacted them, right?                  Yes.                  Right.                  Well, you don't have to look at the messages to determine that with respect to the off-duty messages, right?                  Certainly, counsel. Mr. Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS                  Your point that you made just a moment ago, that we don't want to freeze into place the constitutional requirements with respect to new technology, I wonder if it cuts the other way.                  We re dealing with an amendment that looks to whether something is reasonable.          And I think it might be the better course to say that the Constitution applies, but we re going to be more flexible in determining what s reasonable because they are dealing with evolving technology.                  Well, but that puts a lot of weight -- I mean, there are some things where we don't bind them.    You know, you get the usual parking garage thing that has got all this small print on the back.   We -- we don't say that you re bound by that, because nobody reads it. But in here, I just don't know.                   I just don't know how you tell what s reasonable -- I suspect it might change with how old people are and how comfortable they are with the technology -- when you have all these different -- different factors. You know, they re told you can use it for private; you ve got to pay for it.                 I think if I pay for it, it's mine, and it s not the employer's.                  So, your -- your position would require people basically to have two of these things with them, two whatever they are, text messager or the BlackBerries or whatever, right? Because assuming they re going to get personal things, you know, some emergency at home, they re also going to get work things --                  Mr. Richland, you have 3 minutes remaining.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                Because you think --                -- they re going to lie, right?                  Because you think they're going to lie?                  When they fill out the form and say this is what I've heard, and this -- I can fairly evaluate the law and the arguments?                Counsel, can I -- perhaps it's time for you to shift gears, if I could --                -- and move to the statutory question.                I don't understand why it's difficult.     The statute prohibits  scheme to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.      Skilling owed the Enron shareholders honest services.    He acted dishonestly in a way that harmed them.   But I don't understand the difficulty.                No, there has to be -- there has to be a right to honesty.              In other words, it's not just in the abstract.             And the shareholders had a right to his honest services.                I'm sorry.   A disclosed interest?                What you've just explained is why you think the statute is very broad. You haven't explained why it's vague.                Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                Well, but it's -- it s a different model of it.     As Mr. Dreeben was explaining, if you have an experienced judge who goes through this all the time, I think it's reasonable for him to say:             Look, bring the person in front of me.          We ve got a questionnaire. I can identify the problems, look him in the eye, and I ve got a lot of experience picking a jury, and it's better to let me do it than to have the lawyers have 3 weeks to do it.                Thank you, counsel.

ERIC RESTUCCIA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            I guess the point is, just following up, it's not that you re going to say 2 plus 2 is 6.    I suppose, under AEDPA, all you have to do is say 2 plus 2 is somewhere between 3 and 5, right?            If it's 10,000 of these balls and you are going to go through it 10,000 times, it's more likely that you are going to get a sample that reflects the overall percentage, correct?             I'm sorry.   That -- I'm confused.             I thought it was the other way around.   I thought Grand Rapids gave however many -- you know, 30 percent to the pool and then took Grand Rapids people back?            So -- so do we have any evidence in the record that -- I gather this whole claim depends upon Grand Rapids having more need for jurors per capita than anywhere else?            So do we have any evidence in the record that that s the case?            I would suppose that s something we can find out pretty easily, right? I mean, you look and see how many jurors are pulled for -- how many jurors Grand Rapids needs in a particular period --            -- compare it to how many jurors Rockland needs.

08-1498 +++$+++                  We ll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1498, Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project and the cross-petition. Mr. Cole. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D. COLE ON BEHALF OF HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT, ET AL.                What if it goes to the mere existence of a group?          Let's say you have the Nazi Party, and you are talking about advice or speech on some purely mundane issue.          The Nazis have a hospital, and you are giving them advice on how to run a hospital, but the government decides that anything that legitimizes the Nazi Party, you know, promotes that group's terrorist activities.          Can the government make that kind of determination? I'm thinking of something like Regan v. Wald --   -- where they say, look, you can't travel to Cuba because we don't want to do anything that legitimizes the regime.                No, I meant during World War II.             I m just trying to find an example that doesn't implicate the particulars of the issue today.                No, I didn't -- my hypothetical was confusing.            I didn't mean to suggest we were at war.               I meant to hypothesize a group that the government could reasonably determine should not be supported in any way --                -- because it legitimizes it.     It's going to make their hospital run better.   People are going to like their hospital.                 So the party, the group, will be legitimized.                 Well, you've picked -- you've picked hypotheticals that are very easy for you.   What about personnel?           Is there a connection between providing personnel that participate in legal activity on behalf of a terrorist organization, and the organization can then say, well, because you are providing this personnel, we can take them out and shift them to bombmaking?                   Well, one of the things that s being prohibited here that you challenge is providing personnel.                   Well, is your argument limited to personnel that engages in speech, or does it cover personnel that -- a nurse at one of the -- if there are any, Hamas hospitals?                 Thank you, General. Mr. Cole, we ll give you 5 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D. COLE ON BEHALF OF HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT, ET AL.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN GURA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                Of course, this argument is contrary to the Slaughter-House Cases, which have been the law for 140 years.             It might be simpler, but it's a big -- it's a heavy burden for you to carry to suggest that we ought to overrule that decision.                   In -- in that context, is your position that the rights that are incorporated as essential to the concept of ordered liberty, do they bring all of our decisions with them? When you say the First Amendment is covered, does that mean New York Times v. Sullivan is incorporated as well? Or is it only some lesser version of the incorporated right?                   Yes.                 Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION, INC., ET AL., IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS                 That still allows scope, once you determine that the right is incorporated, for recognizing that the States might have broader interests that the Federal Government doesn't have.   But I would suppose that would come up in the application of the right, rather than in an effort to determine whether parts of it are incorporated or not.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN GURA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                  Your approach -- your original approach would give judges a lot more power and flexibility in determining what rights they think are a good idea than they have now with the constraints of the Due Process Clause.                Privileges and immunities give you a lot more flexibility than due process, because it s not limited to procedural -- where you don't have to deal with the hurdle that it's limited to procedural by the text.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. SCOTT BALLENGER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                Well, what if -- what if Congress was wrong?           I mean, the language that they adopted sure looks quite different to me than what was applicable prior to 1978, and the boilerplate provision that, oh, when we codify this, we don't mean to change anything -- I mean, which prevails, the actual language they used or that boilerplate?                Those are -- those are two different arguments, right; your rail carrier argument and your pre-1978 argument?                Prior -- prior to 1978.   If I think you lose on that question under the law as happens to be currently codified, but would prevail under the pre-1978 law, what -- what is your strongest case for the proposition that what I referred to earlier as the boilerplate language trumps the plain language of the currently codified version?                It's kind of a difficult -- I mean, if you re a shipper and you re trying to figure out, okay, let's ship some goods, and you pick up the law and it says, well, this is what the law says, who's going to tell you that, well, that you may think that's what the law says, but you re really governed by the pre-1978 law.                 Thank you, Mr. Ballenger. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS                  I read -- I read your brief, like your friend's, as relying almost exclusively on the pre-1978 language.                The Union Pacific petition appendix?                 This may not have anything to do with anything.           Is there a reason the STB doesn't appear on your brief?                 It did in the Kirby case just a few years ago.                Thank you, counsel.              Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ballenger, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. SCOTT BALLENGER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
08-1555 +++$+++                   We ll hear argument today in Case 08-1555, Samantar v. Yousuf. Mr. Dvoretzky. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                Well, I ll jump on the hobby horse even if Justice Kennedy is jumping off. I mean, the -- the exception in the TVPA is to the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign state.                 That doesn't sound the way you would just establish a cause of action.                Yes.                 Mr. Dvoretzky, because of that, we ll give you 5 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                It's kind of hard -- I mean, I assume the reason you don't rely heavily on it -- because it says that an agency or instrumentality is an entity.     I mean, we usually don't think of individuals as being entities.                 Thank you, counsel. Counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN HORWICH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                Counsel -- counsel, I think you had said you had three responses to Justice Ginsburg --             -- and only got one out.                All right.   Number two?                 Those are all -- all three of those are -- are pretty subtle ways for Congress to change the view in Castillo.                 Moving something from the body of the paragraph to a separate section and so on.                  Thank you, counsel.                Thank you, Mr. Fisher. Mr. Horwich, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN HORWICH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
08-192 +++$+++                       We'll hear argument first today in Case 08-192, Abuelhawa v. United States. Mr. Srinivasan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  You keep talking about phones and you began by saying this covers phones, but this was -- language was added in 1970?                  Well, there weren't cell phones of the kind you have now.                    I think this was directed at the beepers, right, when those were around then, or land-based phones or something like that.                    And the technology has so expanded that the reach of the statute has so expanded in a way that brings in a lot more casual users than was the case before, and I just don't know how that issue of statutory interpretation is supposed to be resolved.          Assuming I'm right that the technology has dramatically expanded the reach of the statute, even if you think it's covered by its terms, how is that issue addressed?             What's the right answer there?   Is it because the terms still cover it, the breadth has expanded, or because this is something new technologically that the statute shouldn't be construed that broadly?                   Well, I know, but let's assume I don't agree -- let's assume I agree with that only in the context of the 1970s technology.                   What's the answer then?                   It reminds me of these old hypotheticals.         You know, before you had automobiles, you had to have someone with a lantern walk in front of your carriage, and they don't change the law and it still turns out to be the law when you're driving your car and it doesn't make any sense. Is there a case of ours that says what to do in that case, in such a situation of statutory construction?                     Well, but I mean it's natural to view the woman in that situation more as a victim than as someone facilitating the crime.                     I'm not sure that would extend to your case.                   This really isn't the transformation of a misdemeanor into a felony.                  It's a separate, separate activity and an activity that facilitates the commission of a crime.                  It's much easier to carry out your drug distribution business if people are calling you on their cell phones than if they have to meet you in person or call from a land line.                   Your gloss on this statute makes -- gives rise to some difficult questions of proof.   What if it's -- I don't know -- ten pounds of something, and the guy says, well, I was just buying in bulk for personal use, like a Costco dealer. (Laughter.)                   So you would have lost this case before 1970 because the incongruity on which you rely --                    -- didn't exist then?                    Right.   So the scope of this language was changed sub silentio?                    I know, but this language, "facilitating," covered purchasers using a telephone in the period before 1970, but not after 1970, because of the changes in some other sections?                   That question goes to whether or not the distribution was a felony.                   Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Srinivasan. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
08-205 +++$+++                      We'll hear reargument this morning in Case 08-205, Citizens United v. The Federal Election Commission. Mr. Olson. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT                   Counsel --                   Counsel, in your discussion of Austin, you rely on its inconsistency with Bellotti.   Bellotti, of course, involved a referendum and Austin expenditures in an individual election.                    Why isn't that a significant distinction?                  Now that we've cleared up that Bellotti didn't decide the question, what is the distinction that -- why don't you think that distinction makes sense?       In other words, a corporate -- you don't have a potential for corruption if a corporation is simply speaking on a referendum that may directly affect its interest.           If you are dealing with a candidate, what the Court has said in the past is that you do have that problem of corruption.                  In other words, why isn't that distinction a way to reconcile Bellotti and Austin?                  Where did we say that?                 Why don't you tell us now.   We will give you time for rebuttal. (Laughter.)                  Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Abrams. ORAL ARGUMENT OF FLOYD ABRAMS ON BEHALF OF SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL, AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE APPELLANT                   And also inconsistent with his later view, correct?

MCCREADIE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                  Of course, your friend on the other side distinguishes that argument by noting that death is different.               As he puts it, we're all going to die, so --                  -- you have different considerations under the maintenance and cure.                  Mr. MCCreadie, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. MCCREADIE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
08-22 +++$+++                   We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-22, Caperton v. Massey Coal Company. Mr. Olson. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   "Probability" is a loose term.    What -- what percentage is probable --                   If you've a 50 percent chance of bias, a 10 percent chance?                   Probable means more than 50?                      What if, instead of having the focus on one, we're dealing with a trade group that's making the donation.                Ten companies form a trade group.   Is the judge recused in the case of every one of those companies?                    Well, let's just take this case, the same amount of money, except it's not from an individual, not from that individual's company, but from ten different ones, and divide it up by ten.                    Well, okay.   Now, I'm sure you know where I'm going next.                 What if it's five companies in the trade group?                 When do you decide that there's a probability?            I take it if there are two companies, under your theory there would be a probability of bias?                   Well, can I stop you right there, "When their case is pending."                 The Massey Company has a lot of cases pending, so is it only those cases that were pending on the day of the election?                   Well, then we shouldn't talk about pending cases.                   Well, but that's the whole distinction that your friend on the other side makes.   Those cases involve financial interest and the recusal rules are, you know, if you have one share of AT&T stock and it's in AT&T, you have to recuse.                 But this is different.      This is a probability of bias, not financial interest.                  What about the United Mine Workers.       If they give a contribution to somebody's campaign, is that judge then recused in every labor case?    Or I don't know if they give contributions or not, but a group like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, because they think the other judge is too lenient in DWI cases, so they give contributions.                  Is their preferred judge recused in every DWI case?                   Or are those all factors and circumstances we have to look at?                   Well, also, if there is a big -- a big United Mine Workers case, or not even United Mine Workers, involving particular union members, and the UMW gives large contributions to a judge, that -- that judge is recused?                   Counsel --                      Are the States -- are the States really free to do that?                       We have recognized First Amendment interests in participating in the electoral process before.               I mean, would your approach constitutionalize MCCain-Feingold at a State level?                      Well, this -- this --                   Mr. Olson, five minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                     What about --                     What about protective donations?        You actually give, not three million, but a couple hundred thousand to somebody you don't want deciding your case.                And it comes up, and you say, you have to recuse yourself because --                     How do you know?      I mean, are you saying it's going to be clear in every case that the judge is going to rule against the particular entity?                   Is that a reasonable person that's making that inquiry, is that the standard?                   Okay.   Would a reasonable person think it's a ground for recusal if the lawyer and the judge were very close friends?                   You don't think so? A reasonable person comes up and says I socialize all the time, you know, they were at each other's weddings, whatever it is, we know that that's not a basis for recusal.
08-240 +++$+++             We ll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-240, Mac's Shell Service v. Shell Oil Products, and the consolidated case. Mr. Lamken. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN ON BEHALF OF SHELL OIL PRODUCTS COMPANY, LLC, ET AL.            Well, but all -- under one view, all the dealer is doing is mitigating damages. In other words, the deal is off.             He's in effect been terminated.     You're saying, well then, he has to pack up and leave.     He can stay and still reduce the damages you are going to have to pay.               Well, but there --               Well, you've lost the rights to operate at a particular level.             In other words, if they say -- I don't know how the deal works, but, you know, you've got to charge $10 a gallon or, you know, you've got to close the convenient mart or whatever, you have lost the right to operate at that. The terms of the lease under which you were operating have been effectively terminated.           That doesn't mean you can't still make money, and it doesn't mean you have to give that up, but --            -- but the deal has been terminated.            What did Williston say about it?    Contract --             What does Williston say about it?               Well, you -- you put forth this dichotomy between breach of contract and constructive termination.         I don't know why something can't be both.            Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lamken, you have 5 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A.

08-289 +++$+++                      We will hear argument next in Case 08-289, Horne v. Flores and the consolidated case. Mr. Starr. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    Very much true. Counsel, why don't you try and answer?                   Well, I still don't have an answer to Justice Breyer's -- I guess Justice Scalia's question following up on Justice Breyer's.   What are the parameters or the -- the data with respect to the figures Justice Breyer gave you?                   So the answer is that Justice Breyer's figures are correct with respect to the appropriate bases of children.                   You are just saying that you want to use a different test than the one that he was quoting?                   Right.    The figures are accurate.   You just think a different test should be used?                  You lost me.                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Starr, you have three minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
08-295 +++$+++                       We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-295, Travelers Indemnity Company v. Bailey, and Common Law Settlement Counsel v. Bailey. Mr. Ostrager. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY R. OSTRAGER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                    So if part of the settlement -- I mean, Travelers says, we need to get more out of this before we're going to put in all the policy funds; the bankruptcy judge says, well, you are going to be immune from any traffic accident liability; and there is a traffic accident and Travelers said: Well, the bankruptcy court said I don't have to pay.                   Is that all right?   It's within the jurisdiction as you read it because it involves Travelers it's related to the funds they submitted into the trust account.                 Is that --                    No, I know they that didn't intend anything with respect to traffic accidents.     But my question is how far does your theory reach?                   So there would be jurisdiction in the hypothetical that I posed?                   Right, on direct appeal.     Are you suggesting it would be barred -- that Travelers would have protection under a collateral attack?                   Why is that?    It -- it involves one -- it involves the insurance company, its coverage of Johns-Manville.               And the Travelers is saying:    Look, we are not going to do it unless you give us this -- this broader immunity, and the bankruptcy judge does it.    I don't know why it would be outside the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.                    It is clearly related to allowing the settlement to go forward.                  Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Ostrager. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY R. OSTRAGER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
08-304 +++$+++                      We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-304, Graham County Soil and Water Conservation District v. The United States, ex rel. Wilson. Mr. Browning. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   Well, but that's not terribly persuasive.     In the statute there are separate provisions, they talk about disclosures "in criminal, civil or administrative hearings," "in a congressional administrative or Government Accounting Office report, or from the news media."        Simply because you want to limit "administrative" or not limit "administrative" does not mean that the other side's view requires news media to be modified by "Federal."                    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Browning, you have six minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   To -- to follow up, I think it was a question that Justice Breyer asked earlier.   Do you have any tie-breaker on your side? I mean, if we do decide the arguments are pretty much in equipoise, the suggestion was that the Federal government is both the beneficiary and the loser in the qui tam actions, from the sense they lose a percentage of recovery, and so we ought to let them strike the balance. What argument do you have on your side?                  That's the same -- that's one of the arguments that, I think, is balanced on the other side.     For example, is -- do -- have we ever said -- and this is an unusual statute, of course, with a private Attorney General and all that. Have we -- does -- is there any authority for the idea that we should read it restrictively because of that?                  Have we ever -- have we ever said that that's a basis for reading the act restrictively?
08-305 +++$+++                    This morning we will first hear argument in Case 08-305, Forest Grove School District v. T.A. Mr. Feinerman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY S. FEINERMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   I remember, perhaps incorrectly, from the prior argument here that the period that they had to try out the school plan was ten days?                   Not a hard and fast rule.                   So is that -- is that a period that your client's prepared to accept?                   Counsel --                   -- why isn't it the case that the school's diagnosis is a related service under the statutory provision?               It seems to me to be very important service to the parents to know what the school's diagnosis is.                   No, I'm talking about what the parents received.                And they receive a diagnosis, and the statute covers -- asks whether they previously received special education and related services.    Diagnosis would seem to me to be a service related to special education.                      Mr. Feinerman, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY S. FEINERMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
08-310 +++$+++                    We will hear argument this morning in Case 08-310, Polar Tankers v. City of Valdez. Mr. Rothfeld. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                     Why does that -- why does that matter?     I mean, do you concede that if this tax were in some sense nondiscriminatory, you would lose?                   Why are we having all this talk about -- in other words, you think if there was a tonnage tax applicable to everything -- you know, your pickup truck holds two tons; it has got to pay a certain amount or whatever.                 Then do you lose or win?                   I think you're --                   Yes.   I think you're giving up an awful lot.        I mean, what if the Framers -- couldn't they be have been more concerned about making sure that there is a free flow of commerce, that ships go, and the fact that everything is taxed would be less of a concern to them?      But you're -- you're willing to say that if it's nondiscriminatory, even if you would call it a "tonnage tax," you lose?                    But you don't -- you don't suggest that it matters, right?                     You -- you have talked to some extent in the briefs about the bad -- evil motive.                    But you are not going to suggest that the same tax could be valid or invalid depending on why it was enacted.                    I was going to say, even if it's a flat fee?                    Every vessel has to pay, you know, $1,000.                     Well, but just on a -- maybe this doesn't matter.               I have seen the capacity of cargo planes described in terms of tonnage. Does this clause apply to those?                  It is that we have an evolving Constitution, after all.                  Well, then, do you know -- it's not an entirely frivolous point.                  I mean, do you know if States, localities where airports are located charge things that might be viewed as Tonnage Clauses on airplanes?                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rothfeld, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Where -- where does the money go?     If the City of Valdez collects it, where does it go?                  Well, then I think we ought to regard it as a city tax, not a State tax.                  They collect it; they keep it; that sounds like a city tax.                  Well, I suppose the State can regulate what cities and municipalities and counties can do throughout the State.                    That doesn't make everything those cities and counties do the actions of the State.                     How -- under your view, how is a city supposed to impose a property tax on a vessel?                  So -- so you think we should resolve the tax by seeing how generally applicable property taxes are in Valdez?                  Well, but your -- your brother suggests that other items of property are taxed under other provisions of the tax ordinance.                  Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.
08-322 +++$+++                   We will hear argument this morning in Case 08-322, Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District v. Holder. Mr. Coleman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT                  It may be -- it may be a political subdivision under those decisions, but it's certainly not a political subdivision under the statutory definition.                    Well, presumably you wouldn't have standing to raise it because you wouldn't be subject to the preclearance requirement.                 Mr. Coleman, have you 5 minutes.

08-351 +++$+++                 We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-351, Alvarez v. Smith. Mr. Castiglione. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL CASTIGLIONE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  I -- I suppose, if the case is moot, then you are entitled to a Munsingwear order.                  So there s no controlling authority.                  And then I suppose the district court doesn't know whether to award damages or not until it gets a final decision from -- or a decision from the Seventh Circuit or this Court.                But surely your position is going to be that the statutory procedure pre-empts and takes the place of any Slocum hearing, isn't it?   I mean, somebody comes in and files a petition saying, here I'm raising this right under, you know, an early 19th century procedure, and you're not going to say, okay, here's our position or here's the property.   You are going to say, wait until the forfeiture proceeding that is provided under Illinois law.                   Slocum then is the answer to a very different case.              It's a case where you have a class action of people whose cases fell through the cracks and never got the procedures they were entitled to.     It doesn't seem at all responsive to the claim that they are entitled to procedures before it falls through the cracks.                 We will afford you additional time because the Court's questions have intruded upon your rebuttal time.             Mr. Jay. ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER                 Well, I would think you d begin with the mootness question.                   Thank you, counsel.                  Mr. Castiglione, why don't you take 3 minutes? REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL CASTIGLIONE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 I thought your answer is that they didn't all settle.                 Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.
08-441 +++$+++                     We will hear argument this morning in Case 08-441, Gross v. FBL Financial Services. Mr. Schnapper. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   There is some disagreement among the parties, of course, what "direct evidence" means, whether it means direct as opposed to circumstantial, or direct in the terms that for example Judge Collatin put it in the decision below.                   So you are telling us we never required direct evidence, but you are not taking a position on what direct evidence is?                   I mean, you may be right or you may be wrong.          But we kind of have to know what we're dealing with.                   Well, in your petition, you asked -- you used the phrase "direct evidence," and I just want to know in what sense you mean that?                   In your response to Justice Souter's question you said you're only focusing on the direct evidence threshold.                  But if direct evidence is the threshold to give you the benefit of shifting the burden of persuasion of the employer, is it really fair for you to be able to say, we are only going to take out one side of the behalf, we are going to leave the other side of the balance there?                   It seems to me that it's artificial to separate the two requirements, the two aspects of the Price Waterhouse inquiry.                   I understand the difficulty of figuring out who is controlling in -- in Price Waterhouse.     But at least as it has been applied, my understanding -- I understand it has been applied in different ways.     My understanding of what people mean when they say "the Price Waterhouse approach," which is that there is a higher showing of evidence, direct evidence, whatever -- people don't agree on what that means.     But if you meet that showing, then the burden of persuasion shifts to the employer on the issue of causation.                     Thank you, counsel. Ms. Blatt. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER                   Why don't you --                   I will let you get your third reason in in a minute, but why -- do you really think it's fair to pick one part of a complicated test that the court has constructed and say, well, this one doesn't make any sense, and pull it out?                 I mean, maybe it only makes sense in the context of the whole construct, or maybe none of the elements actually make sense.   But it seems to me very artificial to focus on one aspect and say, let's fix this, without assessing what its impact is on the rest of the text.                  That was -- that was because -- that was because of the 1991 Act which addressed Title VII and quite deliberately left ADEA out.                  You are asking us to overrule the aspect of Price Waterhouse involving direct evidence, at least if you look at Justice O'Connor's opinion.                    What -- what would be the position of the Solicitor General on just saying let's get rid of all these artificial court constructions and say this is like any other case, the plaintiff has the burden of persuasion and the defendant can come up with what defenses he has, including that, I did this for some other reason, it wasn't because of age, and the jury looks at it and decides who they believe?                    The statute -- the statute has language.        It says "because of."                 Tell the jury that.                   Go ahead and make your third point briefly.                    Thank you, counsel. Now, Mr. Schnapper, two minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
08-453 +++$+++                    Well, that's correct with respect to a particular loan.                 It's not respect -- with respect to Federal policy about national banks around the country.      It's conceivable and I suppose likely that the Federal regulator would want the same rule to apply to banks in Michigan as to banks in Hawaii.                   There is an historic reason for thinking that Congress would be more concerned about States exercising visitorial powers than they would be about private attorneys general or private lawyers.   This goes back to MCCulloch v. Maryland. National banks were always targeted by the States.                They weren't typically targeted by private attorneys.                So that incongruity doesn't strike me as terribly significant.                   Do you want to talk a little bit about Chevron?                  Whatever the arguments may be on the merits, it's not clear to me that visitorial powers has an unambiguous meaning that would pre-empt the authority of the OCC to explain it to us.                    Well, but -- I'm sorry, but it certainly is pre-empted with respect to visitorial powers.                    This kind of gets us back to where we started.                     Thank you, counsel.                    Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Ms. Underwood. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Counsel, why isn't it a complete answer to what I agree is a somewhat unusual situation of pre-empting enforcement but not the substance of law that its enforcement that raises the concerns?    That the Federal Government thinks the State law is fine, but when you get attorneys general enforcing it in a particular way, that's what causes the problem.     And I mean, the problem arises in a lot of areas.     Even within the Federal Government, the FBI and DEA have different ways of enforcing that might conflict with each other.     Why doesn't that make perfect sense?                   So, why -- why is it a mistake?    Why can't Congress or the OCC think that that's where the difficulties are going to arise?                     In other words, it's kind of a less intrusive approach, and saying, well, you can have your State law but we are concerned about enforcement, so we are going to be the ones that enforce it.                   So your answer is because they have different entities that can enforce it, they are sort of in for a penny, in for a pound?                  If you let anybody else enforce it, you have got to let everybody else enforce it?                   Including the entities that have historically have targeted national banks?                    No, I suppose the question would not be what we think is a good idea but what Congress has done.        And here the OCC has interpreted what Congress has done is to make exclusive the OCC regulation only with respect to enforcement.                    I would suppose you would thank them for that rather than criticize them for it.
08-472 +++$+++                      We will hear argument first today in Case 08-472, Salazar v. Buono. General Kagan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                 I would suppose -- I guess I don't agree with your dichotomy, either it's the same action or it's entirely separate.                  I would suppose it could be some issues carry over and are the same, and perhaps standing is one of those.                 Other issues are completely new, such as the effect of the legislation, which couldn't have been before the district court since it hadn't been passed. But standing is different.                I mean, once it's been determined that there is standing and that is reflected in a final judgment, then I think the later aspects are simply whether the person -- once it's embodied in a judgment, I think that is the basis for standing and not the earlier questions of whether he visited it enough or planned to visit enough.                  And I wonder if you could focus on a particular question.                  What if the government sold simply one square foot, or whatever the area that the base of the cross is -- is resting on the ground?   Would your argument be the same?                  Well, why isn't that -- why isn't that the case here?                  Well, isn't that an interference or it's singling out someone, private property owner, who's using his property in a particular way, a religious way?     You are going to be putting up signs only for people putting up religious symbols.                  But it hasn't done anything like that.      It doesn't say for other property owners that have maybe something that -- you know, a ramshackle shack, that they want people to know this isn't the government's property.               They don't do anything like that. It's -- under your hypothetical, it would be only religious property that would have these special warning signs.                  How is the question of -- I don't want to get into your rebuttal time, but briefly, how is the question of whether signs are or aren't valid or required before us in this case?                There are no signs there, and you are asking us to consider whether the statute is valid or not.                  Thank you. General, you have 2 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN.

08-479 +++$+++                      We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-479, Safford Unifed School District v. Redding. Mr. Wright. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W. WRIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                     Any place, even though he had perhaps no reasonable suspicion to suspect that she was hiding the contraband in her underwear?                     Any place?   I mean, prison inmates, for example, are subject to much more intrusive searches.     Are you suggesting that would have been justified in this case?                  Can I ask just a follow-up on your answer to Justice Kennedy's earlier question about whether the informant was subject to civil suit.    When you said no, did you mean she hadn't been sued or that she could not be sued?                  Okay.                    When was the -- when was she detained there in relation to the lunchtime period, which was when the other student had said that all the kids were going to take these pills?                   Thank you, Mr. Wright. Mr. O'Neil. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID O'NEIL ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING REVERSAL                   Before you get started, do we have to reach the underlying merits or can we just decide the qualified immunity issue?                  Should -- should, but must?                  That sounds like you --                  That sounds to me like the sliding scale that you reject from the Ninth Circuit.                  Oh, surely not.   You are saying if you have reasonable suspicion that it's in the underwear, you shouldn't even bother searching the pack or the pockets.       You should go straight to the underwear.    That can't be right.                   But if your -- accepting your argument that there may be no reasonable suspicion based on Marissa saying this is the person who gave me the drugs, does the fact that she said kids are going to -- the kids are going to take these drugs at lunchtime, a specific time, does that present a difference in the level of concern that the school should have?                  How is a school administrator supposed to know?               Marissa says:     She gave me these pills.    What are they?             I don't know.     And so how is the -- if it depends whether it's a dangerous drug like crack or a relatively -- not harmless, but a different one like ibuprofen, the search depends on that, how is the school administrator supposed to know?                  So what is the school administrator supposed to know when he sees a white pill and doesn't know if it's something terribly harmful, even deadly, or if it's prescription strength ibuprofen?    You say in the former case he can search undergarments, in the latter case he can't.                  So how is the administrator supposed to know what he's dealing with?                   I'm sorry, your answer to me was they have to take it seriously.                 My question to you is, what is the administrator supposed to do?   He sees a white pill; nobody can tell him what it is.   Is he allowed at that point to search the undergarments or not?                   He's not?                   Even if it turns out to be -- you know, I don't know, some very deadly drug?                   That's what you just told us we should do, in answer to Justice Alito's question.

08-5274 +++$+++                   We will hear argument next in Case 08-5274, Dean v. United States. Mr. Forster. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT J. FORSTER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   I think one of the stronger arguments against you is the use of the passive voice.    It doesn't say anybody who discharges a firearm. It says a firearm is discharged.                 And that seems to me to take it away from the element of intent that you're trying to focus on.                    So you think it's different -- I don't remember the grammar too well.                     You think "if firearm is discharged" is different than "firearm discharges;" is that your point?                    Well, I'm not sure that's right.    I mean, if in fact the bank robber tries to flee and the security guard is forced to use his firearm, increasing the danger to everybody else in the bank, I'm not sure this statute wouldn't cover that as well.                     Your -- your argument would give rise to very serious problems of proof.   Every time a gun goes off, the bank robber would be able to say it was an accident.                   I mean, we had a particularly klutzy robber here that everybody agrees it was an accident, but, you know, in many cases it won't be clear. Yes, I was pointing the gun at the person, but I didn't mean to fire it.               It just went off.         And he's sad about it just as everyone else is.                      And that would get to the jury in every case. Just because it was easy here doesn't mean it's going to be easy every time to draw a line.                      And it gets back to Justice Souter's point.                      If you pose the risk that the gun is going to go off, that's additionally punishable conduct.                     That's not my question, really.     The question is the problem of proof. Yours is an easy case.         Most cases it's not going to be. Most cases when the gun goes off, the robber will be able to say, I didn't intend that it discharged.                 It was -- it was an accident.

GOLDBLATT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                Well, that would be a remarkable coincidence if her equipment happened to be worth exactly what Congress said she could exempt, which is a very odd way of reading what she's put in the schedule.                I would have thought the most natural way of reading it is that she's claiming the equipment because she thinks that's the value of the equipment.                   Well, thank you, Mr. Goldblatt.    I'll afford you rebuttal time.                Mr. Wall. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER                 So what does she put down if she thinks this is what the property is worth, but she doesn't know for sure?              I mean, I don't know how you would accurately value a bunch of kitchen equipment. What is she supposed to do?                But that goes through -- I think as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, you have to go through a long process if you're going to have an auction, and for this sole proprietorship, it seems like a waste of money and time.                Well, that's right. I mean, this is a government form, and you say, even though it says "Value of the claimed exemption" and "Current market value," that these debtors should know, oh, you should put in, as your friend said, put in an asterisk and write something else in there.

08-586 +++$+++                    We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-586, Jones v. Harris Associates. Mr. Frederick. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                  Well, but this is different.   I mean, this is part of an expense of a fund.   They don't get fees, but -- but they get -- they have to pay for the lawyers, just like they have to pay for management advice. So why wouldn't you review the lawyers' fees to make sure they are fair?                  Counsel for the fund.                 What if -- if you are having courts decide -- review what is fair, a fair fee, what if the adviser had given such good advice that the fund beat the industry average for his category of fund by 5 percent over the last 5 years.                 Does he get double the normal compensation of the average fees? Does he get triple?      50 percent more?              How is the court supposed to decide that?                    Well, surely you think it is.   When you say they don't give the money back, you are not suggesting that the amount of the fees should be the same regardless of whether they outperform by 10 percent or not?                    Well, but there is different parameters, right, in the sense that you're trying -- the company is trying to attract investors to the mutual fund.    If you are advising a pension fund, it is not the case that they are trying to attract pensioners who have other choices.                 Do technological changes make a difference in terms of disclosures required?   These days all you have to do is push a button and you find out exactly what the management fees are.   I mean, you just look it up on Morningstar and it's right there and you can make -- as an investor you can make whatever determination you'd like, including to take your money out.                 So we could look at -- you know, as the fund grows bigger and he doesn't get those benefits he can go look at another fund.                It takes 30 seconds.                 Companies -- companies change who they invest with under the 401(k)'s all the time.   The employees are not happy with the return they are getting because the company has limited their choices, they change.           It happens all the time.                 You told me just a little while ago, or told somebody, Congress wasn't interested in protecting investors; they were interested in protecting the companies.                     Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS                 Counsel, if we are going to have regulation of what fees can be charged, you cite in your brief the various regulations the SEC has issued.    It makes a lot more sense to have the SEC regulate rates than to have courts do it, doesn't it?                 You are not suggesting the SEC wouldn't have authority to do that, are you?                  Counsel, the statute does not say, in considering the rates you look at all the circumstances.    Am I right?            It says, in considering whether to defer to the board, you look at all the circumstances.                     The board.                     Right.   But isn't that different than saying, in looking at what the rates should be or whether they are excessive, you look at all the circumstances?     It may well be that you don't defer to the board, but that doesn't mean it's a free-for-all in deciding what you do look at.                 Thank you, counsel.                   Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH M. ROSENSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   Does the State routinely keep evidence of the sort Osborne is seeking available?    Or is there a cutoff point at which they dispose of the evidence.                  Justice Breyer.                   Thank you, counsel.

08-645 +++$+++                We ll hear argument next in Case 08-645, Abbott v. Abbott. Ms. Howe. ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY HOWE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER               The answer you just gave about concern for the protection of the child, that applies only to the child?                In other words, in the case that we have been discussing, if the woman would be subject to whatever persecution or domestic violence, but the child -- you know, there s no suggestion of any harm targeted to the child, that would not be a case in which they could grant refuge?               To only -- only to the child?               So the woman would be subject to -- if she wanted to remain with the child, there would be no protection.                  She would have to choose between subjecting herself to violence or being apart from the child?               That would be consistent with the convention, for the returning state to say, we are returning the child, but only if -- you know, bang, bang, bang?             Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER ANDERS ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER             So that if -- so that if you have the mother taking her daughter from, say, a country where she would be forced to be raised under sharia law and that -- that is up to that country to decide whether the child has to be returned?    Or is there a basis for a domestic tribunal in the court, in the -- what is it called, the country of refuge?   Can that country decide that the child should not be returned?             So it's your position that, in that case, the mother should return her daughter to the country where she will be raised under a system that the mother finds quite offensive?             And what -- I know Ms. Howe cited it.     What is the standard on the 13(b) defense?             Does -- does the status of, in this case, women in the country, does that constitute grave risk, or is it an individualized determination?            And that country is going to make a determination in favor of their domestic law and their domestic system.             Presumably, they are not going to say:       We think it's a grave risk to the child to be raised under our system.               Thank you, counsel. Ms. Howe, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AMY HOWE, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER               I'm sorry, I'm a little taken aback by your answer to Justice Breyer. You think the grave prosecution standard means whatever is the best interest of the child?               And you agree with what I understood to be the Solicitor General's position, that that s an individual-specific and not a culture-specific determination?
08-651 +++$+++                 We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-651, Padilla v. Kentucky. Mr. Kinnaird. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                Well, other advice -- for example, advice about whether to take the stand --that can have significant collateral consequences you know, he might lose his job or lose government contracts based on what he says, is that the sort of advice that would be covered in -- under your position?                Only plead guilty? Not, for example, whether it would be material to the defendant in deciding whether or not to take the stand?                  Counsel, I suppose -- before a guilty plea is accepted, the district court judge is obligated to go through a colloquy to make sure the defendant knows the consequences of accepting the plea.   I would suppose if you prevail that that colloquy would have to be expanded to include something like:                    Do you understand the deportation consequences, if any, of pleading guilty?                  No, but that's -- I don't see why that doesn't apply to the more fundamental question about whether the district court has to inquire into the plea circumstances in any event.                I thought -- your answer to Justice Scalia that, oh, well, all sorts of things can come up at trial and the district judge doesn't have to inquire into those, I think proves too much.    It goes to -- and it departs from your focus on the guilty plea.    That's all the judge is inquiring about.   And I don't know why that obligation doesn't extend to a fundamental piece of information that would -- that would, under your theory, make acceptance of the plea involuntary.                 Well, but what you re saying is he has got to tell him all the stuff that s necessary to make the decision to accept the plea knowing and intelligent, voluntary.               And I thought that was pretty much what the district court was doing when they have the colloquy.       That district judge wants to make sure the defendant knows what he is agreeing to.                  Oh, and also drug paraphernalia in the cab.           And I -- was there some marijuana in the cab, too?                  So you -- but your point is an important one.            We don't have the defense case.                  But you don't have the prosecution case either.            You don't know exactly what witnesses they are going to call, what the strength of it is.   So you don't know whether there is going to be prejudice or not.     When you see -- it seems to me you have to make quite a prediction about what the case is going to look like to decide if there s prejudice, to decide if the fellow is going to take the plea or not. And I'm just wondering how you do that.                 It's -- it's going to require, I guess, kind of a mini-trial to decide if the person would have taken the plea.              You've got to know what the case -- his case looked like, what the prosecutor's case looked like, to see if it's something he would have made -- it would have made sense for him to go to trial or not.                  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kinnaird, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 What -- what is your answer to the situation that I think has been hypothesized, of the lawyer -- the defendant asks him, what are the deportation consequences?                 And the lawyer says:    I don't know.    I'm not a deportation lawyer.                I'm a criminal lawyer, but my best guess is that you are all right. What happens there?                 So you can make a claim when the lawyer disavows knowledge on the question?    In other words, he is trying to be helpful, but he also warns the defendant.                 "To investigate"? So even if he doesn't know deportation and the client asks him, he has to investigate that?
08-660 +++$+++                      We will hear argument next in Case 08-660, United States, ex rel. Eisenstein v. the City of New York. Mr. Schor. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GIDEON A. SCHOR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    You wouldn't have to -- you wouldn't have to do anything like that at all. He would just file before 30 days just to be on the safe side.   It's not like he's going to say, I'm going to analyze this 100-page document to see whether I get an extra 30 days to do something as simple as filing a notice of appeal.                   And -- and if the inquiry says it's hard to tell, there's a 30-day limit and there's a 60 day limit, I don't know of any responsible counsel who wouldn't file within 30 days.                   Why would that -- why would it -- I mean, it would still apply to the government or any case in which the government is a party, where it's not an issue whether is the government a party or not.                   Oh, no, no, no, I agree with you that it -- I'm just saying why in a world would the relator want to invoke the 60-day provision if there's at all -- at all a question about whether it's 30 days or 60 days?                    So -- yes, but -- you don't have to know that before you file the one-page notice of appeal.     I mean, if you need more time, you can get more time, but you don't have to know all of that.   It's not going to cost you a lot of money to file the notice of appeal.                   So there may be -- there may be a lot of reasons the relator will not pursue an appeal.     I don't think there's any reason that the relator would not file a notice of appeal within 30 days or, if he doesn't like 30 days, you ask for an extension of time for another 30 days.                 Then the whole issue is moot.                   Thank you, Mr. Wall. Mr. Schor, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GIDEON A. SCHOR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

NAGER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            It seems --            Counsel, it seems to me -- your last few answers seem to me to beg the question.     You start out by saying, well, obviously it's a horizontal agreement among the teams, and then you explain how you are going to analyze it. I thought that was the very question before us:   Whether these sorts of rules and regulations are horizontal agreements between the teams or whether they are part of a particular -- a single entity s articulation of rules.             That you have been begging the question?      Is that -- that part? (Laughter.)                Counsel, could you articulate for me as succinctly as possible the extent to which your position departs from the position of the Solicitor General?                Well, I would have thought it s just the transfer of the inefficiency and lack of clarity from the -- the first question to the rule of reason.    I mean, I'm not quite sure it -- you don't have the same problem.              It's just a question of where you want to rest the inefficiency and confusion.               Well, I -- I thought the purpose of their submission was to respond to some of the questions we've seen, like scheduling, like what the rules are going to be about, about the game. There are some things that it just seems odd to subject to a rule of reason analysis.              And you yourself have said:     Well, that s going to be an easy case under the rule of reason.            Why doesn't it make sense to sort of carve those out at the outset, rather than at the end of the case?              Thank you, counsel. Mr. Nager, you have 3 minutes remaining.

LAMKEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                 It's a bit much to say that the importance is to preserve the stability of two parties' contract, and, therefore, a third party who didn't sign the contract is bound to the two parties' contract.                 Well, so why don't you -- why isn't it restricted to some type of direct, parties directly affected, as well as -- I mean, you complain about the hordes of people who will be able to challenge these.    Well, it assumes that anybody can challenge it.                   I'm sorry?   What do you mean, an exemption for noncontracting parties?                   You don't agree that FERC has the authority to exempt noncontracting parties from the binding effect of the contract rates, do you?                Thank you, counsel. Mr. Miller. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FERC, IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS                Your -- your opening statement about what this Court should do is a change from your statement of what we should do in your briefs. In your -- you just said the Court should remand for further considerations other issues.               In your brief, you say the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed insofar as it granted the petitions for review.    You've changed your position on what we should do.                But that's a change. Before you didn't think there were other issues that affected the determination or might.                  You said we should grant -- reverse the determination insofar as it granted the petitions for review. If we say that the petitions for review should have been denied, then we don't send it back.                And just to follow up, you think we should not address either of those --                -- whether it's a contract or whether you have authority to make an exception to the Mobile-Sierra doctrine?                You don't get to reserve time.                Thank you, Mr. Miller.                Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lamken, you have 3 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A.

GANSLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Without regard to the time?   A break in custody of one day, do you think that should be enough?                   So what if it's repeatedly done?    You know, you -- you bring him in, you give him his Miranda rights.             He says, I don't want to talk.   You let him go.       You bring him in, give him his Miranda rights.    He says, I don't want to talk.               You know, just sort of catch and release, until he finally breaks down and says, All right, I'll talk.                    So I thought Roberson told us it's not a different question, that it's the same question.        Roberson did not draw a distinction between what crime he was being questioned on the second time.                  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Heytens. ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J.

08-681 +++$+++                   We'll hear argument next in Nken v. Phillips. Ms. Harrison. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LINDSAY C. HARRISON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                     Counsel, I'm not sure this matters very much, But do you know if -- are stays usually granted in this type of case?                   Not this type of case:     A removal case as opposed to an application to reopen.                     No, no, I understand it.   I am just saying if you happen to know empirically if most people who are facing removal get a stay.                     Okay.                     Is it possible in this case to kind of split the baby?                     You have a more appealing fact case than is typical, because yours involves a denial of a motion to reopen and doesn't really go to the ultimate merits.                 Most of the petitions I think do go to the ultimate merits, and it's easier to see that (f)(2) may apply there as opposed to your case. Now, is there a coherent way of saying that? In other words, in your type of case, you apply the traditional stay standards, but in a case where the issue that is before the court is whether to order removal or not on the merits, the other approach applies.                   Well, but that's just really saying the way that you avoid that is to say you win across the board.          I mean, it -- my understanding is that in situations in which they are going to be seeking an injunction to enjoin are quite limited.   They are typically just seeking to vacate the legal order.                    No, I think I understand that point when they're seeking to have the order -- the removal order vacated.                     But here you are seeking the reopening of the proceedings, which I guess is a little different, isn't it, than the underlying decision on the merits?                    Is that right?        How can that be?   I mean, you have an order of removal, and then you move to reopen the proceedings.                    Aren't they two separate things?                    Where does it say that?                    Okay.                  Well, that's -- that's kind of a systemic challenge, but you wouldn't have a situation where you get an injunction in far more typical individual cases, right?                   Maybe I'm missing something but -- and, again, I don't know which way this cuts, but the dispute strikes me as very academic as a practical matter:    Judges looking at whether someone is likely to prevail on the merits versus judges looking at whether the person has shown by clear and convincing evidence that he shouldn't be removed.                   The judge that's going to find one in one case, depending on the standard, and the opposite in the same case I can't visualize.                   It doesn't?   You're talking about equities or irreparable harm?                   Both standards?                   Same thing.   And you cannot consider that at all under (f)(2)?                 There's no way in which the removal would be prohibited as a matter of law under provisions that are concerned, for example, about whether the person would be tortured or something like that?                  Because the objection is on this procedural matter?                  But if the objection is that I am going to be tortured so you shouldn't order my removal, he would be able to -- the court under (f)(2) would be able to consider that, wouldn't it?                   Don't they get to pursue that even after they are sent back?                   There are provisions that -- that their case does not abate just because they have been removed?                   Well, I guess that's why -- I guess that goes back to my earlier question, which is, I see that if they are killed the case is probably not in very good shape.               But -- but the situations in which they are likely to face that sort of difficulties upon removal it would seem to me are situations where the removal would be prohibited by law.                   So you think references to equitable relief and restrain are clear enough to cover the Court's authority to grant a stay?                  Thank you, General Kneedler. Ms. Harrison, you have seven minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LINDSAY C. HARRISON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                     I guess General Kneedler's point is that clear and convincing shifts a little, depending on how long you've got to look at it. If you've only got a day or a few hours before the removal is going to take place, you can say this is convincing enough based on what I have had a chance to look at.   But -- and therefore you could enter, I guess, what may be called the temporary stay to get more briefing from the government or whatever.               But you may find out when you look at it a little more deeply that it's not clear and convincing.              What's wrong with that?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA CALL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   What -- what about the government's argument that your interpretation would dramatically limit the reach of this provision of ACCA because of the number of States that define battery in the same way Florida does?                   Yeah, but it's -- it's usually easier just to charge the lowest common denominator, the battery that doesn't necessarily require violent force, and the point -- this was the argument that was accepted in -- in Hayes, that the interpretation, say, advanced by the dissent in that case, would mean that there be a vast number of States that weren't covered. I mean, presumably, Congress meant to cover all the States.                   But I thought the evidence was pretty clear that Congress was adopting the common law definition of battery here, which doesn't require that higher degree of force or violence.

STANCIL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    Could a district judge, as part of his normal pretrial order, say that I am inclined to grant normal motions for extensions, but I think so we don't run into these problems that it's in the best interest of justice that whatever time I grant, I issue an order covered by (h)(7)(A)?                   That avoids all this problem.   I don't have to worry about the Speedy Trial Act when I grant you a motion, because whatever I grant you is going to be excluded under (h)(7)(A).                    But presumably, a judge can do it in every case.               You are saying they can't tell you in advance this is what they are going to do, but they can do it automatically in every case?                  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stancil, five minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    Counsel, is your friend correct that the issue of the proper calculation is not before us?     So that the time I spent figuring that out should be excluded from something? (Laughter.)                    I would have thought that whether or not you think that type of delay is excludable depends on what that type of delay is, which requires some sense of how it's going to be calculated.
08-7412 +++$+++                   We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-7412, Graham v. Florida. Mr. Gowdy. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN S. GOWDY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 Thirty-eight States allow this sentence, though, don't they?                 Thirty-eight, 39.     I know you have a little dispute, but the vast majority of States allow the imposition of this sentence.                 I would have thought that would be strong evidence that they appreciate the gravity of the sentence in the particular circumstances of juveniles and therefore only impose it rarely.                What about -- what if it's the -- pursuant to the usual State parole system, and it turns out that grants parole to 1 out of 20 applicants?                It seems to me that your -- your argument suggests that you are, quite rightly, focusing on the particular facts that have life without parole.    But if you concede that it's all right to have a sentence of 50 years and then a consideration where 1 out of 20 people are granted parole, I think it suggests that the line you would draw is -- is pretty artificial -- or certainly suggests that the next case we will get is somebody with life with parole after 50 years.                 Are you saying there is something in the Eighth Amendment that draws a distinction between 40 and 50 in that case?                We have -- you are arguing for a categorical rule.                Your friend on the other side is arguing for a categorical rule, always permissible.     But we have a precedent that suggests in -- in an individual case, you assess the proportionality of the sentence to the crime. Now, we know from Roper that death is different, and we know from Roper that juveniles are different.     Wouldn't it make sense to incorporate the consideration of the juvenile status into the proportionality review?        So that if you do have a case where it's the 17-year-old who is 1 week shy of his 18th birthday and it is the most grievous crime spree you can imagine, you can determine that in that case life without parole may not be disproportionate. But if it's -- and I know you would argue that these are the facts here -- if it's a less grievous crime and there is, for example, a younger defendant involved, then in that case maybe it is disproportionate. Why -- why doesn't that seem more sensitive? And it avoids all of the line-drawing problems we have been discussing.                  Oh, I understand. But I don't think they'll say that we can't make that determination at 17 years 51 months, but we can make that determination at 18 years 1 month.                  But that is because, as they told us, death is different.                 And you do -- once you decide that, you do have to draw a line somewhere. I'm just wondering why we have to go all the way in with you or all the way with your opponent when our precedent allows us to consider an issue of this sort on a case by-case basis.                 The logic in Roper was very straightforward.       It says, "Death is reserved for the worst of the worst."            I think that was the quote.   We know that juveniles are not the worst of the worst, for the reasons you have articulated, that they are not fully developed, don't have moral sense to the same extent as an adult.            But life without parole is not reserved for the worst of the worst, and so it seems to me that the logic of our precedent suggests that you can't necessarily rely on the juvenile status to exempt them from a penalty that is not reserved for the worst of the worst, but perhaps it makes sense to consider in a particular instance whether the penalty is disproportionate, given the juvenile's characteristics that you suggest.                Well, there wasn't prior to our death penalty jurisprudence, either.                   And I thought we reviewed proportionality as a matter of Federal law in the Solem case.                Right.                Well, so did I, but we are talking about constitutionality under the Eighth Amendment --                -- which is Federal law.                One reason States --                One reason States and the Federal government moved to abolish parole in -- in recent decades was, with depressing regularity, prisoners released on parole committed crimes again. And I'm just -- is there any empirical evidence that tells us how often people, say, from 17 -- 17-year-olds, when released, commit crimes again, as opposed to 18- to 20-year-olds?                But isn't that -- I remember some of those studies that -- I mean, the cutoff, there s sort of a magic age at some point, where people over the age of 35, or whatever, typically don't engage in violent activity.
08-7621 +++$+++                 We will hear argument next in Case 08-7621, Sullivan v. Florida. Mr. Stevenson. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN STEVENSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                Why won't the next case we get be an argument that for a juvenile, particularly one as young as -- as your client, 40 years is too long; 40 years doesn't recognize his capacity for moral development within a reasonable period?                No, but -- I mean, you look at the Federal Government allows this sentence, right?   Thirty-eight States allow this sentence.              I just don't understand how you can say there is a consensus --                -- that this type of sentence is unconstitutional.                 So it would be -- it would be reasonable under your approach to have a different result in these two cases?               A difference in terms of consensus or when sentencing is allowed would result in a different result in your case than in Mr. Graham's case?                 It seems to me, once -- excuse me.                 It seems to me that one way to take that into effect is through our normal proportionality review and in a case by case.                Your  - your client -- his crime is horrendously violent.                At the same time, he is much younger than in the typical case.   And it seems to me that requiring under the Eighth Amendment consideration of his age, as I said earlier, I guess, avoids all these line-drawing problems which seem -- the arbitrariness of the line-drawing seems inconsistent with the notion of the Eighth Amendment.                 Well, I thought -- I would have thought your argument that this is so rare suggests that maybe that analysis, to the extent it s permitted under State law, has worked well for children.                  Well, that's because death is different, is what we said, and because death is reserved, as this Court said in Roper, for the worst of the worst.    And we know that life without parole is not reserved for the worst of the worst.                 So your line is 13, and for obvious reasons.        Another line is going to be 16 for obvious reasons.      When the 15-year-old comes in, he is going to say 15, the 17-year-old -- and that it seems to me is why drawing the line on the basis of the Eighth Amendment -- there s certainly nothing in the Eighth Amendment that suggests there is a difference between 16 and 17.    Everybody with a different client is going to have a different line, which suggests to me that it ought to be considered in each individual case.                Well, but that's because that's a policy judgment by the legislature. Here we are talking about the dictates of the Eighth Amendment.     And the idea that the Eighth Amendment draws those kinds of arbitrary distinctions is one that I don't understand.                Thank you, Mr. Makar. Mr. Stevenson, you have 4 minutes remaining.

08-769 +++$+++                   We will hear, first, this morning, Case 08-769, United States v. Stevens. Mr. Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 What would you -- if you could do it in one sentence, what is your test for determining which categories of speech are unprotected by the First Amendment?                  Well, but to say that they are not concerned with the content, I -- I think is contradicted by the exceptions.                  You have to look at the content and make a decision, is this bona fide scientific, journalistic, educational, historical? So you have to look at the content to determine whether or not the speech is prohibited.                  How can you tell these aren't political videos?               You do have, with organizations, PETA and others, depictions of the same sort of animal cruelty that is used to generate support for efforts to prohibit it.              Why aren't these videos the exact opposite, you know, efforts to legalize it, and, in each case, it would fall under the political exemption?                     Counsel, would this -- would a statute like this apply to humans be constitutional?     You can't depict videos of, say, violent muggings or things of that sort?                 Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Katyal, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                     Did I just understand you to agree with your colleague on the other side, that Congress could not ban the human sacrifice channel because there would be no connection between drying up the underlying activity?                     No. I'm saying there is no connection.     We can't reach the activity where it is taking place.                     So if Congress is -- and we will give you sufficient rebuttal time. So, if Congress is saying, Look, we just don't like what -- is being shown on the human sacrifice channel, we don't want people to see it, they can't do that?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                And the brief. (Laughter.)                 Thank you, Mr. Carvin.                  Thank you, Mr. Lamken. Mr. Carvin, to keep the time even here, you have 8 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                Well, I would have -- Judge Kavanaugh has suggested there are two ways to cure this problem:     One, have the President appoint and remove; and the other thing, make it truly subordinate to the SEC.     Now, I've heard the argument on the other side, both from the government -- well, it's an issue with the government -- the Solicitor General and the board, that the agency, the board, is completely subordinate to the SEC. Well, if Congress -- Congress could fix this problem by saying:     The board is subordinate to the SEC.
08-876 +++$+++                      We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-876, Conrad Black et al. v. The United States. Mr. Estrada. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   Your theory -- your theory that return to the pre-MCNally cases would help you is based almost entirely on the D.C. Circuit case -- case in Lemire -- Lemire.                   The -- the government tells us it was an outlier.                  Let's say you have a bank that is going to be opening up a lot of branches in the State, and one of the directors knows this and knows where they are going to open them.               And he goes around and buys up the real estate where the bank is going to put its -- put its branch, so that he gets the benefit of the -- of the sale.      And assume that the price that -- that he's going to charge is a fair market price, no different than what anybody else would charge. Now, is that sort of self-dealing covered under your view of the statute?                     But he is not stealing -- he is not stealing the confidential information.     As the director, he has the perfect right to know the confidential information.                     Well, I don't know that I would call it a corporate -- I don't know if I would call it a corporate opportunity.                   They are not looking to sell the land; they need to buy it.                  Well, but presumably, the one thing it's odd to suggest Congress did was sort of run 1346 through 1341, when what it was trying to fix was the Court's understanding of what 1341 provided.                     Where -- where in the record do we find your argument that the statute is unconstitutional?                 Counsel, you were -- I think you were about to tell me where you raised it in the Court -- the constitutional argument in this Court?                  Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Estrada, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                    Finish your thought.
08-88 +++$+++                     We will hear argument next in Case 08-88, Vermont v. Brillon. Ms. Rainville. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA RAINVILLE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   It may have been a good concession below.         I mean, it would -- as I understand it, the problem arose because of change in the contract, right?                   I mean, that may well have been attributable to the State.                   I suppose you are willing to concede that there are situations where the delay would be attributable to the State because of systemic problems?                    The State has so many cases, and it's only willing to hire one lawyer. That lawyer can't possibly handle all the cases.                    I suppose -- I'm not sure that we necessarily want to get into the particular details of a very complicated record, but there are several points in the Vermont Supreme Court opinion where it says that the failure of assigned lawyers to do anything to move the case forward is attributable to the State.   And I thought the fundamental principle we were debating is whether or not assigned lawyers who fail to move a case forward, whether that is attributable to the defendant or whether it is attributable to the State because they happen to work for the State. And I would assume one way to dispose of the case would be to decide that general question and send it back for the Vermont Supreme Court with that guidance that they were wrong, as a general matter, to assign delay caused by the counsel to the State, to sort through the record themselves.                     Ms. Kruger. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER                  Counsel, I'm sure you have gone through the record and, agreeing with Justice Stevens that the periods where there wasn't a contract, the State couldn't provide somebody, do count against the State, but disagreeing with the Vermont Supreme Court that when an assigned counsel fails to move the case forward that is attributable to the State and not the defendant, what's the difference in time?                  Yes?                   Thank you, Mr. Nelson. Ms. Rainville, you have a minute remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA RAINVILLE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

You have to say, oh, there looks like there might be scienter, I have to look at it.               And after a year, you find it; yes, there was scienter.

08-911 +++$+++                    We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-911, Kucana v. Holder. Mr. Schoenfield. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICK M. SCHOENFIELD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   Under what authority were these regulations issued?                 If you were to evaluate the validity of the regulation, I suppose, like, an APA case or similar to that, what statutory provision would you look to, to see if the regulation was consistent with that statutory provision?                Yes, but -- is that right?   Would -- would subchapter 1 give you much insight into the scope of the regulation and how it was a fair interpretation of the authority under which the Attorney General purported to act?                   Thank you, counsel.                   Ms. Saharsky. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER                 Counsel, I -- I'm sorry, do you want to finish? Okay. I -- I find it curious -- and maybe you can illuminate it for me -- that the Justice Department is before us, arguing that the Justice Department can't be trusted without judicial review. (Laughter.) And I find that doubly curious when the Justice Department won on the opposite position below. I mean, are you suggesting that the statute is so absolutely clear that you could not stand there and say that your colleague down the hall in the Justice Department could be trusted to exercise his discretion, but in fact you are saying:           I know we won on that, but we are not going to defend it because we think the Attorney General needs judicial review to help him stay in line?                 Yes, but if you take -- if you continued to argue the position you won on before the -- before the Seventh Circuit, it wouldn't be that the standard of review is -- is so deferential that it is okay.   It would be there is no review at all.                 And the position of the Department of Justice was the opposite before 2004, correct?                So if you think it's so bad, the Attorney General doesn't have to do it.                 Why do you need a court to tell you that?                You keep saying "the Board" --                You keep saying "the Board."     Under the statute, it s the Attorney General, correct?                And if he doesn't like what they do, he has the authority to act himself. Whenever somebody delegates authority, they retain authority to act themselves.                Thank you, counsel. Mr. Schoenfield, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICK M. SCHOENFIELD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                Thank you, counsel.
08-9156 +++$+++                      We will hear argument next in Case 08-9156, Wood v. Allen. Mr. Scanlon. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KERRY A. SCANLON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  Was (d)(2) raised in your habeas petition?                  Could you give me a citation for that, where in the habeas petition you made a (d)(2) claim as opposed to a (d)(1) claim?                  That factual determination that you say is unreasonable under (d)(2), that went to deficient performance?                   Did the -- did the State court make a ruling on prejudice under Strickland?                   Do you agree that we have to find that it was an unreasonable determination both with respect to performance and with respect to prejudice to get you through the (d)(2) hurdle?                 Mr. Scanlon, you have three minutes remaining, but I'll give you more, since I would like to start with a question.               My first question was whether your petition was under (d)(2), and during the argument, I went back and looked at the petition. And I see the exact language of (d)(1) quoted in paragraphs 45, 52, 58, 63, 71, 76, 82, 90, 94, 97, and 104, (d)(1), and, unless I'm missing it, nowhere do I see the language of (d)(2).              I see the language of (d)(2) in your cert petition questions. Now, I think there's a huge difference between (d)(1) and (d)(2).           We've been talking about (d)(2) in a case that was only brought under (d)(1). REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KERRY A. SCANLON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  Is the language -- but then I -- you knew to quote the language of (d)(1). You did it -- I think it's more than a dozen times.                 You never quoted the language of (d)(2). Now, going back, you can say, well, we talk about these facts or those facts, but that is also relevant to the application question under (d)(1).                  Well, yes, I find it hard for you to -- to understand how you can say it was focused on when you quote (d)(1) twelve times and never quote (d)(2).     It would seem to me that the focus was on (d)(1).                 Do you think there's a difference between a (d)(1) case and a (d)(2) case?
08-964 +++$+++                  We will hear argument this afternoon in Case 08-964, Bilski v. Kappos. Mr. Jakes. ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. MICHAEL JAKES ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                What -- I'm looking at your claim 1, in Joint Appendix page 19 to 20.                 How is that not an abstract idea?              You initiate a series of transactions between commodity providers and commodity consumers.   You set a fixed price at the consumer end, you set a fixed price at the other end, and that's it. I mean, I could patent a process where I do the same thing.    I initiate a series of transactions with sellers.     I initiate a series of transactions with buyers.   I buy low and sell high.             That's my patent for maximizing wealth. I don't see how that's different than your claim number 1.                  Well, but your claim 1 it seems to me is classic commodity hedging that has been going on for centuries.                   What -- I'm sorry. Just -- what are the physical steps?                 Initiating a series of transactions between commodity provider and market participants?                You get on the phone and you call the baker, and you get on the phone and you call the grocer and say:        I can set up a deal for both of you.                   So you reject -- you reject the substitute.        You think you can patent an alphabet because it is a process of forming words.                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jakes, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. MICHAEL JAKES ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                The -- the physical step that your process involves is picking -- picking up the phone and calling people on both sides of the transaction.

Well, isn't a lawsuit with a potential recovery regarded as property of an individual?                  Does your answer to Justice Kennedy depend upon a notion that the causation standard as -- in RICO is different than general proximate cause standards in tort law?                    But you don't -- you don't think that proximate cause is satisfied only with respect to the person who is supposed to be paying the taxes?   If there's some way in which someone else contributes or makes it feasible or makes it more likely that the person is not going to pay his taxes, that's not automatically outside the scope of proximate cause, is it?                 Thank you, counsel. Mr. Barnhouse, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RANDOLPH H. BARNHOUSE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                 Isn't it -- well, I don't know, maybe it's more -- but isn't it a proposition that you don't rely on illegal conduct, that the -- the assumption of illegal conduct cuts the chain? In other words, there's only proximate cause if you assume people are going to not pay taxes that they're due, contrary to law, and that that breaks the proximate cause chain?                 No, that you have to -- in order to maintain -- this is a helpful question. In order --                 In order to maintain the chain of connection, I thought you cannot rely, for one of those links in the chain, that a party is going to commit illegal action.
08-970 +++$+++                  We will hear argument next in Case 08-970, Perdue v. Kenny A. Counsel. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK H. COHEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                Counsel, this -- this brilliant second-year associate we are talking about, the way these submissions to the Court are -- the way they're presented, do they carve out her contribution to a particular filing?             To the extent I have looked at them they have something like, you know, draft motion to dismiss, and the associate has 40 hours and the junior partner has 10 hours and the senior partner has 5 hours dedicated to that. I mean, if the associate is doing -- in the hypothetical, is doing work at the partner level, how do you know that the brilliance isn't contributed by the 4 hours of the partner rather than the 40 hours of the associate?                   Thank you, counsel.                Mr. Shah. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS                But it's one of the long-standing traditions of the bar that lawyers are expected to do that in the normal course.               So why would that be a special circumstance?                But I mean, you wouldn't say -- you wouldn't suggest that law firms charge more when they represent them?

08-974 +++$+++               We ll hear argument next in Case 08-974, Lewis v. The City of Chicago. Mr. Payton. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. PAYTON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   So under your position, say the City adopts a discriminatory -- takes a -- issues a discriminatory test; people take it; they come out with the results; the City says these -- this is the test we re going to use, but, you know, we don't have any vacancies.     Nobody can sue at that point.                But that -- each -- each qualified firefighter who did not get a job because the well-qualified one did has a new cause of action, I guess, every time somebody is hired from the -- the well-qualified pool?                In other words, somebody is hired, that constitutes discrimination against the qualified black firefighter who was not hired, and then another -- then somebody else is hired -- each time it's a new cause of action?                Yes.                 Yes, so they would have a new cause of action, sure.                 Now, but they -- but if 300 days go from the first round of hiring, they don't -- they cannot sort of piggyback that onto a later cause of action.                 Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS                   So you get --                   So everybody gets 132 over 6,000 times whatever the number of people who would have been hired?             I mean the pay for the number of people.                So I suppose the benefit is not that the City knows it's safe -- it can rely on a test and all that -- but knows that it only has to pay 300 days back.                 Thank you, counsel. Mr. Payton, you have 5 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. PAYTON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

08-998 +++$+++                     We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-998, Hamilton, the Chapter 13 Trustee, v. Lanning. Mr. Hamilton. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAN HAMILTON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                   The review of the determination or the request to move the period is -- is what?     Up to the total discretion of the -- of the judge?                   So your objection to the fact that the judge has more discretion with respect to defining "projected disposable" -- you don't mind the discretion on the other side.                   Right, but the only purpose of moving the time period is to change the income.                   Well, that's a good answer, isn't it, because your point would be the statute does not allow that exercise of discretion with respect to projected disposable income, but it does in the other areas.                   No, my -- my point and what I thought your point would be is that the fact that there is exercise of discretion in two different areas is not the problem.            The problem is that in one area the discretion is specifically permitted and in the other area, projected disposable income, it's not.                   Where is that, by the way, the provision that allows it to move the 6-month period?                   Mr. Hamilton, you have two minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAN HAMILTON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
09-10245 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-10245, Freeman v. United States. Mr. Heft. ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. HEFT, JR., ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER       If -- if we issue an opinion and we analyze the statute's language, the statute's purpose, and the statute's legislative history, would the opinion, the judgment be based on each of those or -- or not?     In other words, does everything that goes into the final determination, would you say that determination is based on each of those factors individually?       No.     My -       I think my question goes in a different direction.     This plea agreement, I think, could be said to be based on the sentencing guidelines, but it is also based on the agreement.     In other words, the combination of the two of them is what gives you the -- the sentence.     So how can you say it's based on only the sentencing guidelines when it may not have been imposed in the absence of the plea agreement? Probably wouldn't have been.       Well, then are you saying the plea agreement was based on the fact that he was caught with -- with two guns rather than four guns? Would you be willing to say that?     In other words, everything -- your position, it seems to me, could be criticized for saying everything that contributes to the final 106 months, that that sentence is based on every one of those things -       -- which makes the -- which makes the statutory language largely mute on this.       Well, it's also based on things that are not reflected in the guidelines.     You've got a particular U.S. attorney who is more lenient in prosecuting these types of crimes than another one.     The fact that you got the minimum under the guidelines might be based on that.     It's based on the fact that this person felt he could handle 106 months in prison, and he wasn't willing to risk whatever the top -- what was the top sentence under the guideline calculation?       So he figures it's better for me to get -- it's based on his decision that I -- 106 months is better than the risk of 117.       What sentence would he have gotten if he were just sentenced under the guidelines, no plea agreement?       Well -- well, how do we know that?       The guidelines give you a range.     The judge might have given him 117 months.       No, I know.     I'm putting aside the plea agreement.     What would he have gotten under the sentencing guidelines?     We --we don't know, right?       There's no plea.     He is convicted at trial.       So how can you say that this is based on the guideline range when the guideline range would not have been determinative?       Yes, I know, but my hypothetical is in a different context.       Thank you, counsel.       Thank you, Mr. Gannon. Mr. Heft, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. HEFT, JR., ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
09-1036 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1036, Henderson v. Shinseki. Ms. Blatt. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, counting -- I appreciate all those points, but counting -- cutting, perhaps, the other way is that it's not a real adversarial system before you get to that stage.     It's a collaborative effort, the Veterans Administration and the -- the individual.       Which seems to me may counterbalance a little bit the fact that the veterans are uncounseled.       I think -- unless I'm missing the point of my colleague's question, it's two different issues. Of course, they don't participate in the court.     They're not -- they're not lawyers.     But it's not clear to me why they wouldn't participate at least in the process of saying you've got to file your notice and here's where you file it. Are you saying they don't do that?       I mean, they do it regularly, and they -- every now and then, they file it in the wrong place?       I don't see how that works.     You've got somebody there, and he has been telling them where to file it and file it and file it, and all of a sudden he tells him to file it someplace else?       What -- what clear statement rule are you talking about?       Yes, I know.     I remember that.       I remember that. I thought that that was a prospective bright-line rule. It's kind of hard to apply a new bright-line rule retrospectively.     I understood what we said in those cases to be:     Look, Congress, we're tired of trying to sort out this ambiguity.     From now on, if you want it to be treated as jurisdictional, tell us it's jurisdictional. That makes sense prospectively, but it doesn't make sense to do that to statues that were passed before we announced our bright-line preference.       No.     I'm trying -- I understand -- changing the subject -- but in my question, you invoked the bright-line rule of Arbaugh that the statute should say "jurisdictional."     And I'm just saying that only makes sense prospectively.       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Blatt, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Counsel, I want to clear up this represent -- represented business.       I understood you to say in the -- your opening that represented -- most of these people are not represented, and they're -- to the extent the American Legion participates, they don't get notice of the order that triggers the 120 days. Now, I understood Mr. Miller to tell us that percent of the people have registered representatives and they do get notice.       Right.       Right.       Was that person helping him registered as a representative?       Well, is that the exception, then?     I mean, Mr. Miller tells us 80 percent of the people do have registered representatives.       It doesn't matter how far away they are if he gets notice.
09-10876 +++$+++        We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-10876, Bullcoming v. New Mexico. Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Mr. Fisher, what if you had two people doing this procedure?     They're sitting in, you know, chairs right next to the other. The one, you know, takes the blood samples from the vials, puts them in another vial, and puts the aluminum stuff on and crimps it.     The other one then takes the vials and puts them in the machine and runs it.     Do you have to have both of them testify?       No, they want to -       They want to present the results of the blood analysis -       -- the numbers the machine spits out.       Even though one -       Even though one didn't do it?     Even though the question is going to be, did you put the aluminum on and crimp it, and the answer is going to be, no, Joe did it; he sits right next to me?       I'm sorry.     That's right.     Does -- do they both have to testify, then, or not?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher, you have 2 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, it depends on when they do it, of course.     I mean, you have the right to look at their evidence presumably so -- so far in advance of trial, whatever, and if they had to get a new -- new technician, that would have to put off the trial -       Thank you, counsel.
09-1088 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 09-1088, Cullen v. Pinholster. Mr. Bilderback. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. BILDERBACK, II, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       What about Dr. Stalberg's new deposition?     Doesn't that count as a new fact?     I'm looking at your brief on page 11.     At a deposition just before the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Stalberg revealed that nothing in the new material called into question his original diagnosis.       How does that work -       How does that work, counsel, if you have new evidence?     My claim was decided, it was reasonable under (d)(1) based on what they knew, but I've come up with new evidence that I think could not have been reasonably discovered before the (d)(1) hearing?     What happens to that?     It seems to me you determine whether that evidence can come in under (e)(2).       So -- so you think -- and I have trouble understanding the parties' position on this.     When you talk about claims, you don't mean totally different legal bases; you mean different evidentiary support.     The claim that it's ineffective assistance of counsel based on organic -- the failure to discover the organic brain damage you say might or might not be considered a new claim, and, therefore, (d)(1) would not be a bar to that.       So then -- and the reason that doesn't undermine your position is because you think it's evidence that could have been discovered and presented earlier?       I understand that. But if it were evidence that could not have been discovered previously, then (d)(1) does not bar looking at (e)(2)?       If it's really a new claim?       I suppose -- I suppose the Federal court can send it back to the State court for exhaustion.       Just a second.       Thank you, counsel.
09-11121 +++$+++        We will hear argument next in Case 09-11121, J.D.B. v. North Carolina. Ms. Blackman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA S. BLACKMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       The whole point -       The whole point of the Miranda rule, I thought, was to provide clear, objective guidelines about what the police are supposed to do.     And it seems to me that one of the difficulties with your rule, however clear it may seem in this case, but it does have to apply more broadly, is that that's off the table, and now they're not only going to have to know, does this person understand it, but they're going to have to know, it's not every one of these situations that's going to be in school.     They're going to have to guess how old the person is. And there are differences.     Some 15-year-olds know a lot more than some 17-year-olds, and so on.     And -- and the facts that you're concerned about all go into the voluntariness inquiry, which is still pertinent after Miranda.     Why don't we just put those facts into that inquiry and say, look, we've got one strict rule; everybody knows it, you hear it on TV all the time, people are given Miranda warnings; that part of it is done?       Would it be -- is it enough if the officers in this situation said, look, you're free to leave, you know, whenever you want, but -- and then goes on -- or do they have to think - now, maybe -- maybe a 13-year-old really doesn't think that's true, or maybe a 13-year-old really doesn't feel that he can leave if he's got the vice principal there and they want to talk.       I'm thinking it would not even be enough if they told the 13-year-old, look, you can leave, but I want to ask you some questions.     And the principal is there, and he thinks, well, you know -- maybe the 13-year-old is thinking, maybe I'm going to get in trouble if I leave.       How is that relevant to the Miranda inquiry?     It might be relevant to the voluntariness inquiry, but I don't see whether you call the parents or not.     Part of his Miranda -- your Miranda right is not to have your parents called.       Independent of what?       Well, right.     That's my whole point.       So is your answer to Justice Ginsburg that, no, the fact that a parent was not notified is not relevant to the Miranda question? It may be relevant to the voluntariness question.       Oh, so it's not just that they have to call the parent; they have to wait for the parent to show up?       That's not -- that's not pertinent to the Federal law question on the Miranda warnings.       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Blackman, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA S. BLACKMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
09-11311 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-11311, Sykes v. United States. Justice Ginsburg is not on the bench, but will participate in the argument through the transcripts and -- and the tapes. Mr. Marsh. ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. MARSH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Looking -       I'm sorry.     Looking -- looking -- I don't mean to interrupt your answer, but looking for a safe place to stop violates the statute?       Thank you, Mr. Wall. Mr. Marsh, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. MARSH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, it's, for me, anyway, an important question.     I'll -- I'm not sure the ordinary case does.     I assume the ordinary prison escape is -- I don't know -- over the wall, under the tunnel or, you know, while the guard's looking a different way, or some -- I don't know that it's typical that when the guard is there, you say now's my chance.     The typical case doesn't involve aggression.       Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.
09-11328 +++$+++        We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-11328, Davis v. United States. Mr. Kerr. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ORIN S. KERR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, Mr. Kerr, our cases have talked about the deterrence impact on police conduct.     It seems to me you're trying to expand that notion to cover incentives for defendants, and as I read -- I guess it's Leon, in footnote 25, it says the argument that defendants will lose their incentive to litigate meritorious Fourth Amendment claims as a result of a good faith exception is -- is unpersuasive.       Well, I think our - our theory on the exclusionary rule across the board, without regard to the underlying substantive violation, is that you look to deterrence of police conduct.     And here, I mean -- I mean, you agree the police did nothing wrong in this case, don't you?       So what impact - why do we want to deter them from doing what's right?       If I could just follow up on Justice Ginsburg's question.     Why did this defendant have any incentive to bring his constitutional claim if, as may or may not appear too likely, the inventory search is going to result in the admission of the evidence anyway? It seems that your theory goes too far in saying that defendants will never have an incentive to bring a constitutional challenge if there's some other ground on which the evidence might be admitted, and that's never been our law.       Well, it's often - we do that.     We take cases where you can bring a constitutional challenge or a different challenge all the time, qualified immunity cases, you know, what was the law and was it clearly established?     Defendants bring the qualified immunity cases all the time even if they have a tough case on whether it's clearly established.     Harmless error cases, the underlying violation, whether it's a harmless error, and the Court can decide the case on either ground, but that doesn't keep defendants from bringing the claims.       So your incentive argument really only holds up when the ground on the alternative ground is hopeless?     Otherwise we'll expect the defendants to bring a Fourth Amendment claim because it's pretty easy to bring.       You're asking us for an exception to our general approach, assuming the general approach is not the one you succeed, for, as you put it, cases where there's zero possibility of success, while allowing application of the good faith precedent, even if the chances of success are remote. Is it really worth the candle to have litigation over whether it was a difference between zero chance and remote chance, as opposed to continuing to apply the good faith rule across the board?       I understand your position on that.     Now, getting to my question, is it really worth it for us to have litigation over the difference between zero and remote in determining what rule we should apply in this case?       Most lawyers don't take that position.     Most lawyers would argue the Court's precedents should be overturned and, if not, here's why our case is different.     And we would still be required under your theory to look if that second argument has zero chance or only a remote chance.       And it seems to me -- I mean, in terms of the incentives on the defense counsel, it would be an odd defense lawyer who is going to say you should consider argument A because my second argument has got zero chance of succeeding.       The difference between zero and remote. (Laughter.)       Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Kerr, you have 6 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ORIN S. KERR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
09-115 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 09-115, Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting. Mr. Phillips. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Thank you, counsel. General Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS       Just to pose there, we've had a little discussion about what licensing laws are, but we haven't talked at all about those last two words, "and similar laws."     It seems to me that whatever wiggle room or ambiguity there may be in saying whether this is a license or not, Congress swept pretty broadly. It said, not just licensing laws, but licensing and similar laws.       I'm sorry.     Let me just -- I mean, businesses had to have licensing laws pretty much across the board, right?     You couldn't set up a -- I don't know -- an electrical contracting business if you didn't -- weren't licensed to do business or met the requirements for an electrician.     It wasn't just agricultural work.       Even if they said -       Even if they said "and you have to renew your license every year or every months"?       You don't disagree that whether or not a company hires illegal workers is related to quality or -- or ability to do business or qualification?       Counsel, just so I get -- make sure I understand your approach.     You're saying that Arizona had a law saying you have to have a license to do business, and then it became aware of a problem it wasn't aware of before -- it found out that a lot of employers were employing child labor, and they didn't know they would do that -- and they say we can revoke your license if you're determined to have employed child labor; that that would not be okay?       But it would be okay if, in the original licensing thing, they said "and you can't employ child labor"?       But you had -       I was just going to say you tried earlier to talk about the two boxes, and you said something would be pre-empted by the first clause.     Anything -- civil and criminal sanctions are allowed if they're imposed through licensing and similar laws.     There are not two boxes.     The State can do what's in the first part so long as it does it through licensing or similar laws.       Is it similar to a licensing law?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Well, except - well, you're just kind of blinking over the savings clause:     except through licensing and similar laws.     So that's not a real reservation by Congress of this power to itself.
09-11556 +++$+++        We will hear argument next this morning in Case 09-11556, Tolentino v. New York. Ms. Schwarz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KRISTINA SCHWARZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       So the only way that the police can prevent an unlicensed driver from driving in this situation is to take away his car?     Impound the car, as you say?       Unless they want - for any offense, you know, expired driver's license. Expired last week.     They can't just give the guy -- they can't give the guy a ticket, right?     All they can do is take away his car? Your answer to a number of the questions has been that -- that have tried to address the issue of what are they supposed to do, since they know they have somebody who is violating the law, is that, well, they can take away the car.     And I just want to know if that's the only permissible response by the police when they know that the person driving has violated the law.       Totally illegal.       Totally, yes.       And the only way to prevent him from reoffending immediately is to impound the car?     Because if he gets into the car and drives, then -- or can the police arrest him right away?       Why not?     Why wouldn't they -       Is that your answer, then:     They've got to impound the car every time or let the guy just go?       They could tell him not to drive until he clears up his license?       Thank you, Mr. Shah. Ms. Schwarz, you have 4 minutes remaining.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN HACKER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       You're talking about -- you're talking about who's right or wrong about the connection between Matrixx and anosmia.     But that's not the question.     I'm an investor in Matrixx; I worry whether my stock price is going to go down.     You can have some psychic come out and say Zicam is going to cause a disease, with no support whatsoever, but if it causes the stock to go down 20 percent, it seems to me that's material.       But -       A reasonable investor is going to worry about the fact that thousands of unreasonable investors are going to dump their Matrixx stock. (Laughter.)       So -- but, I mean, there's nothing unreasonable about that.     If it looks - if you're looking at Good Morning America, you say, my gosh, everybody else is going to sell this; I'm going to sell, too.     And if it turns out you knew about it, you should have told me about it before.       It may not know, but it certainly can know.       If you -- if you know this is a very false report, but we know that, I don't know, the surgeon general, somebody, is going to come out and announce it and that will cause an effect -       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hacker, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN HACKER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
09-1159 +++$+++        We will hear argument next this morning in Case 09-1159, the Board of Trustees of Stanford v. Roche Molecular Systems. Mr. Ayer. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, in theory -- I mean, you're cloaking yourself in the interests of the United States, but we're going to hear from their lawyer shortly.       Do you ever have different arrangements with respect to the assignments depending upon who the researcher is?     I mean, I suppose -- I would have supposed there are very prominent researchers that you would like to have at Stanford, and you would be willing to negotiate less than a requirement of full assignment of their inventions in order to -- to get that person there.       In other words, you'd be willing -- wouldn't you be willing to sell the interests of the United States down the river to get - to advance your interests?       Well, but I thought the law meant that the United States got whatever interest the contractor got, right?     And if -- it doesn't say what the contractor can or can't do with respect to the employees it has.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       Mr. Ayer, you have two minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.

09-1205 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 09-1205, Smith versus Bayer Corporation. Mr. Monahan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. MONAHAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       What if -- how far does your procedural right extend?     Let's say in the second action, the court says, look, we've been through all this before; we have had a million pages of discovery from the prior action, no protective order at all.     So while, if you were the first person here, you're entitled to, you know, 10 interrogatories, because we've been through this before, I'm going to say you can look at all the discovery that's there, but you only get 5 interrogatories. Now, do you say no, no, no, I'm entitled to the same procedural rights I'd have if I were here first?     Is that right?       So now it's not only that you're entitled to your day in court substantively; you're -- you're entitled to your day in court procedurally as to some procedural aspects but not others?       Thank you, counsel. Thank you. Mr. Monahan, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. MONAHAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER       Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Dreeben. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN, FOR RESPONDENT, IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER       It's kind of hard under our precedents to draw that precise line between enumerated powers and the Tenth Amendment, and it seems a bit much to put defendant to the trouble of trying to do that under the theory from TVA that they have no standing to make a particular type of Tenth Amendment claim.

09-1272 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 09-1272, Kentucky v. King. Mr. Farley. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA D. FARLEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       So, you have an apartment building where the police know from experience there's a lot of illegal activity, a lot of drugs, drug transactions.     Every 2 weeks, they walk through and knock on every door and wait for evidence of the destruction of -- of drugs.     Is that all right?       Well, the probable cause, of course, comes when they hear the, you know, flushing and the, you know, hiding or whatever behind the door.       I'm sorry.     I think I've got two different probable causes that's caused - causing me some confusion.     I understand their requirement of probable cause, and that they hear sound of evidence being destroyed and therefore enter.     Is that -- or are you talking about the probable cause to think there's something going on in the first place?       So there's only one probable cause, right?       Okay.       Sure, you can. There's nothing illegal about walking down the hall and knocking on somebody's door.     And if as a police officer you say I smell marijuana, and then you hear the flushing, then there's probable cause.     You don't need any business about the dealer and the breezeway and all that at all.       Thank you, Mr. Farley.       Ms. O'Connell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Farley, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA D. FARLEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       But they can't gain entry by deception.     They can't knock on the door and say "Pizza"; right? (Laughter.)       No, no?     Okay.
09-1273 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 09-1273, Astra USA v. Santa Clara County. Ms. Blatt. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Is it -- I'm not sure of the answer, but is it different in this case or unusual that the agreement is between the Federal Government and private entities, as opposed to what I think is the more typical situation in which these cases come up, where it's, say, an agreement between the Federal Government and a State?       Yes.       What about a False Claims Act action?       You -- you emphasize that the contract has the language in haec verba of the statute.     What if -- what if it doesn't? The statute imposes certain provisions.     The pricing I guess is the key one.     But in a private deal, when you're arranging for the delivery of, you know, pharmaceuticals, you could have a lot of provisions. It's got to be delivered by this much.     You've got to have this much inventory.     You've got to -- whatever. I mean, what if the contract here included terms beyond those in the statute?     Could those be enforced by the third-party beneficiaries?       Yes?       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS       Is it -- is it a contract at all?       You could do this, I guess, by regulation, right?       Issue a regulation saying manufacturers who participate in this program agree to do, you know, whatever your contract says.       It identified the problem that the individual beneficiaries did not have a remedy?     They -- or that courts had indicated that they didn't and they thought there should be a remedy?       Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Ms. Blatt, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
09-1279 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1279, Federal Communications Commission v. AT&T, Inc. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS       Well, privacy certainly isn't as limited as you argue "person," "personal," is.     Corporations have private property. They have private documents.     The concept certainly applies in the corporate context as it does in the individual.       You don't have confidential property or secret property.     You have private property.       I suppose -- I suppose families have rights of personal privacy, don't they?       So in some contexts -- in some contexts, personal privacy does go beyond the individual?       Aggregations of individuals?       Thank you, Mr. Yang.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang, you have 6 minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID BOIES ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER  I just stop you there.  What if that had been disputed?     Is that something that can be disputed at the certification stage?       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       Class certification is not a merits determination except with respect to reliance?     Except with respect to the fraud on the market theory?     That you can; that is a merits inquiry and you can decide it at the class certification stage?       Thank you, Mr. Sterling. Mr. Boies, you have 5 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID BOIES ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       So you win, so you win at the certification stage or at the pleading stage, whatever.     So why is it such I big deal to you here?
09-1454 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1454, Camreta v. Greene, and 09-1478, Alford v. Greene. General Kroger. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. KROGER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       It doesn't just do that.     Is -- is Mr. Camreta in any more comfortable position when he knows that the Ninth -- what the Ninth Circuit thinks on this issue and he just has to wait until there's another case when they can impose the view that they've already spelled out?     I know as a technical matter it's not binding, but if you're Camreta, do you say, well, the Supreme Court vacated that decision, so I can go ahead and do this again and not have to worry about personal liability?       They're supposed to file circuit -- follow circuit precedent, aren't they?       On the merits -       -- do you think that the same approach you're following here would apply if the investigation focused on the student rather than a third party?     Would in those cases a warrant have to be obtained?       No, no, not another child.     It could be anything.     We think the child is, you know, selling drugs, obviously not a 7-year-old, but someone else in the school is involved in legal activity, him- or herself.       So -- so you think it would be a different rule if we're talking about some other criminal activity?     The father's selling drugs, and you think the child might have some evidence or at least be willing to talk about that.     Do you need anything other than reasonableness in that case?       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kruger. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS       It would be -       It would be a partial vacatur, right?     The Court's done that before, hasn't it, where we vacate part of a decision under Munsingwear?       If it's vacated, it indicates that there's no established law on that question, and it seems to me Camreta would be free to do what he considered appropriate under the circumstances, and if somebody tries to impose personal liability on him, it seems he has an even stronger case than he might have before.       General Kroger, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. KROGER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

09-1498 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 09-1498, United States v. Tinklenberg. Mr. Roberts. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER       Well, all that might be true.     On the other hand, the statute does say "delay resulting."     And under your approach, the time would be excluded even if delay does not result.       Two?     How many circuits are we talking about?       Courts of appeal -       It -- it may be pertinent on this question:     Mr. Tinklenberg was designated for transfer to MCC in Chicago on November 10th.     How was that done?     Was that done by -- is that a court order or is that an administrative -       So the BOP did it, not a court?       Well, I don't know -       You seem to be getting into this.     I just wanted to know if it was a court order on the 10th, and what you're telling me is the last court order before he was moved was on the 2nd.       Well, maybe -       Do you agree with that?       Who wants the benefit of this new rule?     Who wants the new rule?     Does the government want the new rule or does the defendant want the new rule?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Roberts, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
09-150 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 09-150, Michigan v. Bryant. Ms. Palmer. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LORI B. PALMER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, it can't all be the formality of the context.     I mean, if the police came in and said, well, has this person -- Rick, I guess -- sold you drugs before, what was the -- what was the quantity, and all those sorts of questions, the answers to that would be testimonial, despite the same lack of formality.       I'm confused of what -- what Davis focuses our inquiry on.     Is it the purpose of the interrogators or is it the purpose of the declarants? We say the statements are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events. The -- the focus seems to be on the purpose of the interrogation, which seems to be the question of what the police thought, not what the -- the person dying thought.       Yes, I mean -       But what the footnote -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but what the footnote says is, in the final analysis, it's the declarant's statements, not the interrogator's question, that the Confrontation Clause requires us to evaluate. So which -- I guess, which is it?       Well, then, how does that apply?     The officer says, what happened?     And the -- the declarant says, Rick shot me. Now, is that testimonial or not?     Because the declarant knows he's 6 miles away.     It's not going to help them solve an emergency, but the police don't know that.       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kruger. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       No, but then you're saying that the focus is on the police officers.     I mean, after all, we're not saying that police officers can't do this; we're just saying the testimonial aspects can't be admitted into evidence or that's what your friend is arguing for.     I still have trouble figuring out is the issue the purpose of the interrogating officers or the purpose and intent of the declarant?       Okay.     And what do you do with the last sentence of footnote 1.     It's the one that says -       Right, right.       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Palmer, you have 2 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LORI B. PALMER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
09-152 +++$+++        We will hear argument this afternoon in Case 09-152, Bruesewitz v. Wyeth. Mr. Frederick. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       What is -- I'm sorry, Mr. Frederick.     What's the point that you are trying to make?     That because there are a whole bunch of provisions designed to help manufacturers, that this one can't possibly also be designed to help manufacturers?       I would have thought the argument would go the other way:     That because they set up a compensation scheme, that was a good sign that they didn't want to allow State law claims.       So you are asking us to interpret this statute in light of his testimony at a hearing?       It seems to me the language supports the reading Justice Ginsburg has just suggested, or the government has just suggested, with the use of the word "the."     It says the effects of the vaccine were unavoidable, even though the vaccine was properly prepared.     Your position is, well -- the question is whether it was unavoidable if you could have prepared a different vaccine.     But this says "unavoidable, even though the vaccine."       I don't see the word "if."       It would depend, I suppose, on what they thought the judgments were going to be in the 1 percent of the time.       It doesn't take too many $60 million verdicts to make you come out on the other side of your calculus.       If the language -       But I'm not sure that in most cases you are going to be able to tell immediately -- you are marketing one vaccine and something else is being tested or about to be approved, or it's on the market -- that that's safer. Particularly since you have to look not only at - whatever -- injury and mortality rates, but also efficaciousness -- or efficiency, I guess -- in terms of the vaccine. So you don't know right away.     Somebody comes in and says, Here's a different vaccine; your vaccine causes one death every 10,000 doses, or whatever it is.     And the other says, This is better; it's one death every 12,000 doses.     You say, Well, but ours is more efficient in stopping the vaccine. Well, how much more efficient?     Well, it depends on the judgment of a jury.       Mr. Frederick, take five minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       I thought Mr. Horwich told me that the CDC does compare new vaccines to the ones that are out in the market?       You think he was incorrect in that assertion.     We can go back and look at these weekly reports and they are either going to say this is better than the one that's out there or they are not.       I'm just trying to find out what your position is on that.     Do they compare it to existing vaccines or not?       I'm not asking about law, I'm asking matter of fact.       You open up the weekly report.       When you open up the weekly report and it says this new vaccine is better vaccine than the one that is out there or not?
09-1533 +++$+++        We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1533, DePierre v. United States. Mr. Pincus. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Counsel, the provision refers to "a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base."     You read cocaine base to be crack, so you have to be talking about a mixture or substance which contains crack.     What contains crack? Crack is the problem they're getting at; yet the statute, as you read it, has to talk about a substance which contains crack, not just crack.       It's kind of an odd way for Congress -- it's an odd way for Congress to phrase the provision if what they want to get at is crack, to say what we want to get at is substance which contained crack.     That suggests to me, when you talk about substances that contain something, what they contain is a base that then is used in the substance. I think that's a harder, harder logic to apply when you're talking about crack.     They want to stop the use of crack, not so much -- it wouldn't occur naturally that they're talking about substances which contain crack. It would occur naturally, that language formulation, if you think of cocaine base as broader than just crack.       You kind of elided the point there in your verbal formulation.     It's easier to say this is something that's not just cocaine.     It's harder to say this is something which is not just crack because crack is a type of cocaine.     You can say it contains, as the government says, cocaine base.       And you're saying Congress is afraid that the sodium bicarbonate, we might not be able to get at that if we just say crack?       Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Pincus, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
09-158 +++$+++                    We will hear argument next in Case 09-158, Magwood v. Patterson. Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    What if the sentence is -- he is convicted, sentenced to 10 years, and raises an argument, and only an argument, that cuts off 2 years of his sentence.   He says under the statute the maximum is 8 years, and the court says, the judgment is vacated to the extent it goes beyond 8 years. Can he then bring a new challenge to, say, the whole sentence, or cut it off at 4 years, or does that limit his challenge?          In other words, I'm trying to get to the point that it's not just the conviction, but if it's a period of the sentence that is not subject to challenge the first time?                     But that's an issue that we look at all the time under AEDPA.                     That's not a new approach.    AEDPA says, you know, if you show that a claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive, that was previously unavailable.                     That seems to me to be the same inquiry, as to whether or not a claim could not have been raised in a prior habeas petition.                     It's an -- I thought your point -- I thought your point was, oh, this is going to be hard to do, impossible, as you say.                   It seems to me -- it seems to me those are the exact same problems that would arise, do arise, under AEDPA.               You have got to show that it's a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive.                     Thank you, Mr. Maze. Mr. Fisher, you have 2 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L.

09-291 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 09-291, Thompson v. North American Stainless. Mr. Schnapper. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       I understood your brief, and certainly the Government's brief, to take a very expansive view of what type of retaliation would give rise to a cause of action by the -- the directly harmed employee. Now you seem to be suggesting that that employee would not have Article III standing to bring an action.       Thank you -       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kruger. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       You -       Go ahead.       Well, but you say - but it won't be because of the degree of connection between the -- the retaliated-against employee and the means of retaliating. I understood your brief.     I'm just looking at page 6.     The limitation you propose is someone - someone close to him.     The anti-retaliation prohibition "prohibits an employer from firing an employee because someone close to him filed an EEOC complaint." And I guess I have the same concern that we've been discussing for a little while.     How are we supposed to tell, or how is an employer supposed to tell, whether somebody is close enough or not?       But Burlington Northern, of course, is quite different, because you're just -- you're dealing with the obvious plaintiff in that case.

What if the case were there were two people behind her and she was pushed?     And she didn't know which one pushed her, Jones or Smith.    So she sues Jones, and Smith knows all about it because, of course, he's a key witness or whatever. Can he be substituted later on because he was the person she should have sued?                  One of the people pushed her, and she named that -- she named the other person.                    She made a mistake about who pushed her.                     Can they have substitution in that case?                  Yes.     The non-pusher has notice --                  -- and everything else. But there s no relationship between the two of them.                  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bendure, you have 9 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R.

09-367 +++$+++                   We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-367, Dolan v. United States. Ms. Karlan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  In this -- when the judge did not enter a date for restitution, did you object to that?                  Well, why not?        It seems that that's when the violation occurred.                    The statute said the court shall set a date if they re not ready to calculate the restitution, and he didn't do that.                  Well, I thought it says -- maybe I am misreading it.               It says the court -- this is at sentencing.      When sentencing -- you look at the previous provision -- what is it?                   3663A(a)(1) --                  -- talks about what you do when sentencing it.                  And the statute says,  the court shall set a date for the final determination   &  not to exceed 90 days.                    And he didn't.                  No, I think that's right.     I -- I agree with you that.                  In other words, the final determination -- the date for the -- the final determination can't exceed 90 days --                  -- but that doesn't mean that the provision saying the court shall set a date can wait -- that he can wait 89 days to do that.                    No, no, no --                So you can -- under your view, you can change the amount of jail time up to the point at which you have to set the restitution.               The judge says:    I'm going to sentence you to 3 years, and I'm going to figure out the restitution. He looks, and the restitution turns out to be a lot more than he thought.             So he says:    Well, I'm only going to give you 2 years.             Or it's less, and he says:    I'm going to give you 4 years. Because the judgment is still open, he can do that?                  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Karlan, you have 4 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, Mr. Schnapper. Mr. Miller. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER       Do you regard -- is that the same as a but-for cause, the motivating factor?       What about a situation where a particular procedure such as the one here is set up for a discriminatory reason, and the employee is really upset with that, and so he, you know, starts a fire in the plant?     Wouldn't have had - wouldn't have set the fire if not for the discriminatory purpose.     Now, does he have a cause of action in that case when he's fired for setting -- setting the office on fire?       It wouldn't have happened -- yes.       So you do accept that the traditional doctrine of an intervening cause is applicable in this?       Well, but what - what independent intervening cause -       Well, but -- I'm -- I'm sorry, but I think the end there just kind of glided over the whole issue.     You say it had nothing to do with his military status.     It has to do with a procedure that was set up because the employer was discriminating against him because of his military status.     So it certainly had something to do with his military status.       Well, I know, but the hypothetical is extreme to try to flesh out your position.     You can certainly imagine an employee reacting in a particular way by being put through procedures that were set up in a discriminatory manner that would seem to anybody to be a basis for termination, even though the groundwork was laid by the discriminatory procedure.

And the district court says you can't throw it out on that basis; under trust law, it doesn't matter. And it goes back. Now, the district court doesn't know what s going to happen.

09-475 +++$+++                   We ll hear argument this morning in Case 09-475, Monsanto Company v. Geertson Seed Farms, et al. Mr. Garre. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                   You agree that those are two different things, then, right?                    The vacatur is one thing and the injunction is another, right?                   And under the vacatur, the normal APA remedy is a remand to the agency. In fact, there are some courts that say you can't get anything else.     But whether you can or can't, it's clear that the burden is on you to get something short of complete remand.     The burden is on your friends to get -- establish the injunction. The problem with combining the two, it seems to me, is that you are imposing on them the burden to meet the injunction standard simply to get a remand to which they are entitled under the APA.                 But the vacatur does that.   You can't plant once the deregulation order is vacated.                 So you would say that the injunction is limited only to a decision the agency might make to allow partial planting?                 Right.                   Right.                   Right.      Why did it do that?     I mean, the way the APA works, this is sent back to the agency.           If the agency wants to partially deregulate, it can do it.                       And then you can challenge it under the normal APA procedures.                   It's very odd to get an injunction to an agency telling them they can't do something under the APA.                    What authority do you have for the proposition that when a court vacates an administrative order, it has the authority to tailor an injunction rather than simply remand the matter to the agency?                    I guess -- Weinberger, of course, involved a statute.                     I mean, the concern is that the authority to determine how far to go in deregulating or partial deregulating is for the agency to make.   And once there has been a violation of the APA, it goes back to the agency.                      What the district court did here was assume that responsibility itself.                   Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Stewart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART, ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENTS, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS                  You have the burden to establish your entitlement to those conditions that are short of a remand, correct?                  Sure, sure. Agencies can do that.                  Well, sure, because -- but here the question is whether the court can do that.     The court is stepping into the shoes of the agency.     And I would say it's -- I mean, there's authority that you can't do that at all, but certainly you d have the burden to establish that those reliefs short of remand, that you are entitled to that.                  Well, you re short-circuiting notice and comment or whatever else is required, the reason we send this to an agency, because they are expert and all that.             The agency is acting without the benefit of any input on the partial deregulation.                     Do you -- do you agree that when you re talking about the elements of the injunction that are short of remand to the agency, that the Respondents do not have the obligation to meet the injunction standards with respect to those?                   In other words, it's part of the judgment.                   It's not an injunction, and you have the burden if you want the court to do anything other than send it back.                     No, I'm talking to the -- about the types of activities that would be prohibited if the court just remanded it back, vacated it, which is everything -- you can't plant.                  I guess my point is they don't need an injunction.              The thing that s bothering me is you ve got two different things, the vacatur and the injunction.            And it seems to me by melding them together, you re trying to impose the burden on the plaintiffs to meet the injunction standard to get the benefit of the vacatur.

FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                  But not to the question of which parties have agreed to arbitrate?                  Not the question of which parties have agreed to arbitrate?                  But I suppose that the substance of the agreement -- maybe this is just the same question as Justice Scalia's.                  I suppose the substance of the agreement is evidence -- could be evidence on the unconscionability at formation.                   And that is for the court.                   No, the point is -- it's not that.   It would be the -- the provisions are so one-sided that you may assume from that that the formation was not voluntary.                  So your position is that the arbitrator gets to decide questions of unconscionability, but the court gets to decide whether the arbitrator can do that?                  I would have thought the answer to your -- the answer to your answer would be, well then, the -- you re more likely to win on that question.    Obviously, you are going to lose on the gun to the head, but if it s simply the economic inequality or whatever, under the State law you re probably going to prevail, and they will say there is a valid contract.                  I thought the -- your -- your whole point was simply it's all or nothing. The courts get to decide is there a valid contract or is there not.           And once they decide there is, then everything else about unconscionability of particular clauses is for the arbitrator.                   Thank you, counsel.

SADY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                  I'm sure there is something wrong with this predicate to this question, but the -- the statute allows the Bureau to make a determination of good time credit within 15 days after the end of each year of the sentence.                  They cannot make that determination within 15 days of the 311 days.                   And so "each year of the sentence" must mean each -- the full year, the 365 days.

GALANTER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Counsel, if this were a private suit, let's say Ford Motor Company has two subsidiaries, Ford East and Ford West.     They get into a dispute.     Ford West sues Ford East.     No Federal court would entertain that action, would it?       Yes.     They think -- Ford West thinks Ford East is discriminating on the basis of race.       That adversely affects their reputation, too, so they sue them.       No, no.     It's independent -- right -- it's independent from what?       Yes -       -- but is it independent from the State?     Is that what the statute says?       You say on page 27 of your brief, the blue brief, that there's no big deal here with respect to State sovereignty because ultimately the sovereign retains the authority to dissolve the State agency plaintiff if the State believes the litigation is too onerous.       That's a good -- a good cite for your proposition, but arguably in those cases, the ICC is really not the real party in interest. The real party in interest is the beneficiary of the ICC ruling.       To get -- to get back to my question, you -- no court would entertain Ford West against Ford East?       Not divisions; separate corporate entities that happened to be wholly owned by the same parent.       Well, I would have thought that would become an advisory opinion.     Ford has an internal dispute, basically, and your -- in that hypothetical, one of the entities would be asking the Federal court to resolve it.     Ford can decide at the end of the day how it wants to resolve it.     If Ford West wins and Ford East loses, Ford can say, all right, this is how we're going to do it regardless of what the Federal court says.       Well, the State here is free to dissolve one of the -- one of the parties to the case.     That's -- that's a little different.       All right, State, Commonwealth.       Oh.       Well, right, but that makes all the difference in the world because they made the choice of saying this is going to be one of us, the State.     And as far as what issue is before the Court, I would suppose the Article III question is a jurisdictional one that we have to address before reaching the Eleventh Amendment question.       -- do you know -- do you know of any other situation where one party to a Federal court action can dissolve the other one in the middle of the case?     I mean, if VOPA files a discovery request with the State and they think it is, as you put it in your brief, too onerous, the State can say:     Guess what, the case is over, you're dissolved.       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       Can EPA sue the Army Corps of Engineers for violating the Clean Water Act?       Oh, very adverse. EPA wants clean water, and the Army Corps of Engineers wants to, you know, dredge the water in a way that contributes to pollution.       Do you agree with the Petitioners that Virginia can dissolve VOPA if it finds the litigation too onerous?       If -- if it happened to arise, do you think that they can -- do you agree with the Petitioners that they can do it?       Are you sure that the governor cannot remove the members of VOPA?     I know it says VOPA has to be independent of any State agency, and the governor appoints one-third.     Can the governor remove the members of this Virginia agency?       What would it not - what would it not comply with?     I just don't know.     I'm just looking at the provision where you say it's independent, and it says independent of any State agency.     You said the governor may not appoint more than one-third.     I just wonder if there's a prohibition on him removing.       Where is that?       What if the VOPA officials are engaged in corruption or illegal conduct or, you know, extracurricular activity that brings discredit upon the -- the governor has no power to say that, you're a Virginia official and you're -- you know, whatever -- breaking Virginia law, for example?

But if we sustained -- if we sustain the preliminary injunction, the Government can't ask that question throughout the -- the -- the reach of the Ninth Circuit?       So when you say your position would be no, you mean that there is no right of any kind under -- I know you don't want us to reach it, but you would say there is no right of any kind for a citizen to tell the Government that that's none of your business.     The Government will decide that it can ask anything of a citizen, so long as you don't disclose it.       Do you think it's firmly rooted in our traditions that there is some right to tell the Government that's none of your business?       Yes, but that's putting those aside.     I mean, what about some of the hypotheticals that Justice Alito posed?     Your diet?       That's certainly relevant in the employment context, right?     They're going to have to pay for your health care, worry you might miss things, miss days of work. So I guess the point is:     Do you think the Government's right to inquire in the employment context is exactly as broad as a private employer's right?       What is the reason -- I've had trouble putting my finger on it -- that you need the information about counseling? You already have the information, have you used drugs in the past year?     I couldn't tell if you thought the question about counseling was for the good of the employee -- oh, you are taking steps to -- or was it to allow you to show, well, it must be serious, because you need counseling.       -- you have to be a little suspicious. I mean, if it's -- the employee gets to expand upon his or her answer.     They say, tell us about it.     And they can say, don't worry, I'm in counseling or treatment.     And even then, that doesn't sound like it's for their good.     It's one thing to say, I had a drink. It's another thing to say, I'm in AA.       Now, I had a question about the way it's worded.     You're supposed -- it says, if you've used it in the last year, detail your involvement with drugs and any counseling you received. Do you understand the counseling question to be limited to the past year, or to reach back as far as --       But do you think it's required?     I mean, you do sign at the end, this is true to the best -- do you think it's required to disclose counseling and treatment you received more than a year back?       Well, how do you know -- how do you know that?     I mean, you ask a lot of questions on these forms, and they say, well, we're not going to hire you.     How can you go back and say it was because you put in, you know, in treatment for -- for drug abuse?       Over the last 5 years, this has only come into play 128 times across the Federal bureaucracy?       Federal contractors.       Thank you, counsel. General Katyal, you have 4 minutes.

SCHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                Is this case different if the filing error -- I understand there was a lot going on, but if the lawyer just miscalculated the days and was off by one day, this case comes out the other way in your view, right?                I guess I understand what the cases have said.         I -- I have trouble understanding why that should make a difference, why that should be so pertinent, why he should be in better shape than somebody who says:             Look, I don't know anything about this.     I need a good lawyer.               This is what I get.     I'm trusting you.      Tell me what I should do, and I leave it in your hands. And that person is in somehow worse shape?                Thank you, counsel. Mr. Scher, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TODD G. SCHER ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER                  If I m worried --               If I m worried about the open-ended nature of what you re asking for, how -- how would you state the test you would like in the most restrictive terms?                Hurricane or kidnapping?                Oh, the different one. (Laughter.)                What type -- the problem comes up when you say  this type of attorney negligence. What is your test?         What type of --                No, I know your test will mean your client wins.             But, I mean, can you articulate it more -- because I m very concerned that if you start saying, well, you can forgive an inequitable case, every time a case comes up, you re going to -- there s going to be sympathy for the client.               The lawyer goofed. Of course, you don't want to penalize the client, but Congress obviously had something more in mind.
09-559 +++$+++                     We ll hear argument this morning in Case 09-559, John Doe v. Reed, Washington Secretary of State. Mr. Bopp. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                  Counsel --                  I'm sorry, go ahead and finish your answer.                  Now, counsel, the responses you have given to a couple of the questions has been that the First Amendment analysis would apply. But given you have a facial challenge, is that enough? Don't you have to indicate that the First Amendment analysis would prevail in either all of the other cases, most of the other cases, a significant portion? This is a facial challenge.                And if the challenge is going to fail in some of those other cases, I think your facial challenge fails as well.                  So we have to decide, in assessing your claim that, no matter what the referendum issue was, that there's a significant intrusion on First Amendment rights?                  So that if, for example, the referendum involves a bond issue as to which people may have particular views, but they re not going to get terribly excited about it, we d still have to say that that s protected under the First Amendment?                  Well, my point is, though, you re not likely to get that with respect to, you know, a debt issue, raising the debt ceiling from 0.8 percent to 0.9 percent.           You re not going to get a crowd outside your house because you signed that petition.                  I suppose the -- a majority of the voters in Washington decided that, and one of the purposes of the First Amendment is to protect minorities.                  Thank you, General MCKenna.

HUBACHEK ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Maybe this is - maybe you would like to answer Justice Breyer's question.       No, he would have a remedy.     The remedy for an equal protection violation is to treat everybody the same.     You can do that either by lowering the people who are given a benefit or by increasing the people who aren't.     So he has a remedy. His objection is, we're not being -- my father and my mother are not being treated the same. That's all of the relief he is entitled to.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hubachek, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN F.

Is it a formal finding of recidivism by the -- by a jury?           No, but the State prosecutors often prosecute when they have a recidivist provision under that, rather than the much more difficult illicit trafficking crime.        I mean, if you re going to go to jail for a certain amount of years for a recidivist possession, that's easier to show than illicit trafficking.                Thank you, Ms. Saharsky.

09-6338 +++$+++                   We ll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-6338, Dillon v. United States. Ms. Freeland. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA B. FREELAND ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                    What if the Sentencing Commission just issued a new guideline and said anyone with a -- a crack sentence, their sentence is going to be reduced by 10 percent?                   That wouldn't present any problems, would it?                    But there's no --                    But 3553(a) doesn't even come into play under my hypothetical.                    3553(a) doesn't even come into play, so there's not a resentencing by a judge.    It is just an across-the-board policy, like increasing good time credits.                Right, in -- in this case, but in my hypothetical Congress hasn't done that. It hasn't -- or the Sentencing Commission hasn't done that.    They haven't invoked the discretionary sentencing.    They just said:            Across the board, 10 percent off.                Only Booker?                   Only Booker? What if there is another constitutional objection to the sentence, and he goes back under -- under the crack cocaine?           Can you say, oh, and, you know, also, it violated my rights under equal protection?     You didn't notice that before, but here's the argument.     Is that before the sentencing court?                   Yes, you would you have to say.     So --                   So it's not only as unfair as Justice Ginsburg hypothesized.                    It's even more unfair than that, because just because of the crack cocaine change, somebody with an equal protection challenge gets to raise that.                While somebody in prison without an equal -- with an equal protection challenge but not the crack cocaine one is still stuck.                Well, that's a new constitutional rule.    This is an old one.              This is one that was -- you know, the equal protection clause has been in the books for a while.           And -- and he -- he just gets the chance to raise it solely because of the fact that his conviction involved crack cocaine.                Oh, no, no, no.     I thought under your theory this is a whole new sentencing.    So who cares whether he waived it at the first one?    We re starting from -- from point zero.                 And my point is that they shouldn't under your theory.            The fact that he waived it at the earlier sentencing under your theory should not matter at all, because your theory is that this is a whole new sentencing, so who cares what went on in the prior sentencing?                I'm sorry. Why --                Why could they -- the first part of that, why could they not hold him for the term under the 1993 sentence?                Thank you, Ms. Kruger.

09-6822 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 09-6822, Pepper v. United States. Mr. Parrish. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALFREDO PARRISH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Counsel, I think you -- I think you've got a difficult job navigating between your two issues.     It seems on the first one, the percent to 20 percent, you're saying:     Look, you've got to stick with what you did before.     And when it gets to the post-sentencing consideration, you're saying: Well, we can -- all bets are off; we can start -- start anew; we can look at things that have happened since. Is there a way you reconcile that - those -- that tension?       Well, that's kind of a fortuitous situation, then.     You're sort of saying if you end up with the same judge, she can reconsider her own prior determination.     But if you, for whatever reason, the death of the first judge, you're in a different judge, she's bound by what went before.     That doesn't seem right.       Well, it's -- it's warranted that the one get the benefit, and it's unwarranted that the other does not.     I mean, the departure in the case of the one who gets reconsideration is warranted, but that doesn't mean that the disparity is warranted.       You may want to -       -- reserve time. Thank you, counsel.       Mr. MCLeese. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY W. MCLEESE, III, ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT, IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER       Counsel, perhaps before your time is up, you'd like to address the first question.       But it has nothing -- but what if the appeal had nothing to do with the issue at all?     I'm thinking in -- the analogy in the civil context, so you have two totally unrelated issues. If you appeal issue B and that's what the fight is about, and you reverse and send it back, it would at least be unusual for judge to say, oh, and by the way, I'm coming out the other way on issue A.       But these are not interconnected, are they?       No, my point is that the level of assistance is not in any way connected to the post-sentencing conduct.       No, but why -- why does that matter when you're talking about two totally unrelated issues?       There's no reason to suppose that the court of appeals thinks there ought to be -- or any issue with respect to the question A when they focus solely on question B.       So, you're worried about the general rule, but you agree that none of those arguments make any sense in this case.       That would not interfere with the new judge's or the judge's discretion across the board?       I have never had to sentence someone, but it seems to me, particularly when you have a change in the judges, there's a very personal investment in what you do with the -- the defendant, and to say that, well, another judge looked at this factor so your hands are tied in that respect is -- is a questionable result.       Is there reason to suppose when they say de novo resentencing, they're talking about the mistake that was made with respect to issue B and not issue A?       Do they -- is it their practice in some cases to say we're sending this back for de novo sentencing but only with respect to the issue that we addressed?     Or do they just normally throw it out and say start over, without any supposition that the district court would take a look again at something that wasn't before the court of appeals at all?       Could they -- are you aware of any case where the Eighth Circuit has said we're sending this back for resentencing but only on the issue that we addressed on appeal?       Finish your sentence.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Parrish, you have 2 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALFREDO PARRISH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
09-737 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-737, Ortiz v. Jordan. Mr. Mills. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID E. MILLS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       I'm sorry to interrupt so quickly, but that especially, I take it - I take it, is a concession that there's a difference between claims for qualified immunity based on evidence and claims that are based on law.       I don't understand, counsel, how your argument -- that in every case you need to know the facts, every qualified immunity case you need to know the facts, and those only come out after trial -- is consistent with our recognizing that you can have a collateral order appeals denial of summary judgment.     In other words, you can consider qualified immunity without knowing how the facts are going to come out at trial, which is why we allow you to have an appeal before trial.       Well -- so you're just saying your case on qualified immunity isn't like that case; is that all?       But you have an obligation in opposing summary judgment to, in your list of disputed facts or facts that preclude summary judgment, to put all that in.     And why didn't you put the point you are raising now in the opposition to summary judgment?       I know.     So it -       Well, but -- but you may prevail.     You may have three different factual disputes that the other side is saying are undisputed, and the fact that you prevail on one doesn't meant that you didn't have an obligation to put in your opposition the others.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Mills, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID E. MILLS ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER       So your rule, in response to Justice Sotomayor, would basically require anyone who has an assertion of qualified immunity to take their collateral appeal or interlocutory appeal.       So they are put to a choice whether or not their qualified immunity claim rests entirely on law or might turn out, as you say it did in your case, to have some factual aspect?       Well, that's kind of a tough choice to put them to, isn't it?       So they have to take the immediate appeal, and when they do so, they lose the right to appeal at the end?       Well, why is that?       Thank you, counsel.

Were you finished --       Were you finished answering Justice Breyer's question?       You -- so you have no objection if the sign said "Get out of Iraq" or antiwar protests; in other words, not directed at this particular individual?       So no objection there?

OLSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Then you can't -       Then you can't require, it seems to me, each individual to make a calculation about whether they have actually been harmed, whether there's detrimental reliance.     The whole point of these plans is to give people some comfort and assurance when they are age whatever, that:     Don't worry; retirement is taken care, or at least I can rely on that. And your formulation would sort of put that up in the air and say:     We don't know if you're going to be harmed or not; wait until you're 65 and we will see.       Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

KASTER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER       So if he just says to the employer, "You know, I think we ought to have a little more time to put on our gear," is that an assertion of statutory rights under the FLSA?       Yes, I know, but the idea -- one of the objections to your position is that it's going to be very hard to figure out in any particular case what is a filing an oral complaint under the FLSA, because one, it's got to be reconstructed, unlike the situation where you had have a government agency that's doing it, or you have a written complaint; and second of all, it's -- it's unclear perhaps for the employer to know that he's being charged with a violation of the FLSA.       Well, if it's written -- if it's written, you have got a document that people can look like -- look at, whether it's the NLRB or a court, that -- that they can look at and say, yes, this is a -- an assertion of a violation.       Well, what if he goes to the boss and says, boss, you ought to do something, that railing is -- is pretty dangerous over there.       Is the boss supposed to know, well, he is asserting statutory rights under the FLSA?       That would not be filing a complaint?       Mr. Wall, I -- this is just a factual.     Were you saying that the employee has to know that he is submitting a claim of statutory violation or the employer?       Thank you, counsel.       Mr. Kaster, you have five minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. KASTER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, counsel.
09-837 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 09-837, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research v. The United States. Mr. Olson. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Well, you keep focusing, Mr. Olson, on -- on this case.     And one of the things that I think is important in the tax code is that you not have litigation of each different case, so the different courts are coming out with different rules. And, at the end of the day, you put one next to the other, and it looks pretty hard to tell the difference. So why doesn't it make sense simply to refer to -- defer to the Service's interpretation?       You go back and - both of you go back and forth with hypotheticals, each of which sort of supports, but this basically a very familiar situation of an apprentice who is both an employee and both a student, and to try to draw the line in some categorical way doesn't make sense.     The only way you can draw the line is to have somebody say:     This is going to be the line.     And if anybody is going to say it, it ought to be the IRS.       You're not challenging that, are you, Mr. Olson? (Laughter.)       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Olson, 5 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Why are we talking about National Muffler?     I thought the whole point of Chevron was to get away from that kind of multifactor ad hoc balancing?       If Chevron applies, those considerations are irrelevant, right?       Thank you, counsel.
09-846 +++$+++        We will hear argument next in Case 09-846, United States v. Tohono O'Odham Nation. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, but that's - you just -       Well, but it's not -- it's not as broad as your test, "arising out of the same operative facts."     It doesn't say that; it says "any claim for and respect to which."     And it seems to me that the facts of this case draw that precise distinction.     When you are asking for an accounting, you are not raising any claims about people doing anything bad at all.     You are just saying, let me know what I've got.     And then when you bring a claim for -- for money because of mismanagement of the trust, that's -- that's quite different.       Is that -- is that to assert the basis about why an accounting should be required?       Well, what is the - maybe I don't know enough about what an accounting is. But why would it be other equitable relief to which they are entitled if they simply say, we want to know what we've got?       And they can get - and then it may be a basis for a further claim that, if that's all we've got, where did the rest of it go, and that might be the Court of Claims action.     But it does strike me that they are different -- claims for different relief.       Is it accounting what should have been in the trust fund or what actually is?     You say give me an accounting of the trust fund. Does the officer go back and just add up the bank accounts and value the land and all that?     Or -   -- does he go back and say, well, this should be there but it's not?       Going forward.       Well, are you at cross-purposes on those two issues?     When it comes to what an accounting is, you want to say, oh, that's just going forward; when it comes to this 1500 question you want to say they're the same as the money damages, which goes backward?       It's not -- I mean, you are putting a pejorative spin on what they are doing, saying, you know, many plaintiffs like to take a chance in more than one court.     But your response to Justice Breyer suggests that that's a tough choice if you have to choose between injunctive relief or damages. That's not them trying to, you know, get the same - take two bites at the apple.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Do you agree with your friend that there are differences between the accounting you can get in the district court and the accounting you can get in the court of federal claims as a prelude to monetary damages?       Sure.
09-868 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-868, Wall v. Kholi. Mr. Weisman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON L. WEISMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Are those different than the characteristics that the sentencing judge looks at in the first instance?       In other words, how these -- you've obviously seen a lot of these, and I haven't seen any, but I mean, do the Rule 35 motions typically say -- do they typically concede the legal validity of the sentence and then simply say -- what? mean, I assume the sentencing is -- is completely open and you can put in anything at all, like the -- the deprived childhood, the unique situation, the age, whatever.       In what sense is Rule 35 different from the arguments that are made at sentencing?       But that's bad for you, isn't it, I mean for the very point that Justice Kennedy was raising?     If it's the same sort of arguments that you get to raise as a legal matter prior to the imposition of sentencing, why should they not be considered legal matters when they're raised under Rule 35?       Are those issues that can be -- that are typically raised on direct - direct review?       Thank you, counsel.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Weisman, you have 6 minutes remaining.

09-9000 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-9000, Skinner v. Switzer. Mr. Owen. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       But that disconnects the irreparable harm alleged with respect to the stay and your claim that you now say -- you say now your claim is not going to necessarily affect the -- the sentence.     The irreparable harm, if I remember, is quite obviously the execution.     But it's -- there is no irreparable harm from your failure to get access to the DNA evidence, unless it's linked to the sentence.       Osborne expressly considered both procedural due process and substantive due process.       The critical formulation in Heck, "necessarily implies," is a little difficult.     I mean, the adverb points one way and the verb points the other.     And how -- "necessarily implies" strikes me as a little less conclusive than you seem to think.       Well, you -- you read "necessarily implies" to mean "conclusively establishes," right?       So you are asking for an expansion of Heck from "necessarily implies" -       -- to "demonstrates"?       So if "implies" doesn't mean the same as "establish" or "demonstrates," give me an example of a case where the 1983 claim would not establish innocence but would still be covered by Heck.       Necessarily implies or conclusively establishes?       Well, but what you say in the rest of paragraph 33 is that you want the biological evidence because by refusing to turn it over, he prevented you from gaining access to exculpatory evidence that could demonstrate he is not guilty of capital murder, which is usually what we -- what habeas corpus is for:     To show you are not guilty of what you are in prison for.       I understand.     But did I understand you to say that you -- different cases where people are seeking the DNA evidence might come out differently under Heck.     In other words, if it's the type of DNA evidence that could conclusively establish he's innocent.     I mean, there are types like that.     It's somebody else's, you know, DNA and that's what's necessary for the conviction. And there's others -- other types of DNA evidence that doesn't.     I mean, it just happens to be on the scene of the crime and it turns out that it's not him that was in the room, but, you know, he was somewhere else, and it might or might not mean he's innocent. In the former case, do you say that has to go under habeas, but in the latter it doesn't?       Mr. Owen, take 5 minutes -- or you have 5 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY ROBERT C. OWEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, counsel.

In other words, food -- you don't have to say, well, he did spend this much money on food, so he gets the standard deduction.

KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       Mr. Kneedler, is your argument in this case limited to Spending Clause legislation?       So, you think --       So, you think there may well be implied rights of action outside the Spending Clause context.       So --       So, your -- your answer to my earlier question was that you're not arguing about that in this case.       So, the Government -- the Government -- we don't have a position from the Government on whether or not there is an implied right of action under other constitutional provisions.       I mean, outside the Spending Clause context.       Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Ms. Schwartz, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KARIN S. SCHWARTZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

LEFKOWITZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Well, that makes a lot of sense, but we do have our Wyeth decision that seems to cut the other way.       Well, Buckman -- Buckman was arguably a little bit different, in that there's a concern expressed in that case that requiring allowing the State suit to go forward would cause manufacturers to basically inundate the agency with proposals and warning revisions, so that there would be so many things that the agency wouldn't even be able to process them, and they would become meaningless to the consumers.     That doesn't seem to me to be a concern in this case.       To disclose -- I'm sorry.     To disclose to the FDA?       Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Lefkowitz, you have your 5 minutes remaining.

And for it to be real -- just so I understand -- for it to be real, you have to have a defense counsel, a client comes to him with a non-frivolous Federal habeas claim, and the defense counsel says, I can't tell whether we're going to be barred by this time rule or not.     Some courts, looks like we will; some don't.     So -- what? Of course he's going to file the Federal habeas and see if it's determined to be adequate or inadequate, correct?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Marshall, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TODD MARSHALL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

KRUGER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING REVERSAL       Counsel, did -- just to be clear, your answer to the question presented is no, right?

10-1001 +++$+++        We'll hear case next in Case 10-1001, Martinez v. Ryan. Mr. Bartels. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT D. BARTELS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       I'm sorry.     I don't -- I don't understand how that works.     The claim is, say, for example, you were ineffective because you didn't raise a Batson claim.     Surely, he gets to pursue the Batson claim once he establishes ineffectiveness --       So -- so, the lawyer -- the State would be required to provide counsel not simply to raise the threshold ineffectiveness argument, but to go ahead and raise the arguments as to which he was ineffective.       So, you would be happy with a system that said, no, you don't have to raise it on collateral review; you have to raise it on direct appeal.       Which is very unworkable, because if you're arguing ineffective assistance of counsel in a direct proceeding, presumably it's usually the same counsel; he's not likely to bring the claim.     That would be worse for criminal defendants --       -- than the system that's there now.       Well, but the person --       The person who decides what arguments you're going to make on appeal is usually the person who handled the trial in these types of cases.       In Arizona, the usual case in criminal cases is that somebody else handles the appeal on direct proceedings?       Thank you, counsel.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bartels, you have 2 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY ROBERT D. BARTELS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-1016 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1016, Coleman v. The Court of Appeals of Maryland. Mr. Foreman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. FOREMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Where -- where are you reading from, counsel?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Foreman, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. FOREMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Do you think it would be --       Do you think it would be -- how would this case come out if we were dealing with -- with subsection (E)?     Do you think that should be treated separately than the prior ones?       How?       If -- if we think that you should look at these provisions separately, where with respect to (D) -- and I'm looking at one of our prior precedents -- has Congress unequivocally declared its intent to abrogate sovereign immunity?       Unequivocally.     Not on the basis of implications from -- from how the other provisions work.     But if you do look at (D), is there any place where Congress unequivocally declared its intent to abrogate State sovereign immunity?       Well, but your -- the answer you gave to my request depends entirely on a conclusion that (D) is linked to (A), (B), and (C) because, otherwise, you don't have the argument that it's precisely relief with respect to a discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment.
10-1018 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 10-1018, Filarsky v. Delia. Ms. Millett. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       But your test -- and this is -- I think goes broader than the articulation of the test -- doesn't give this private attorney much assurance by itself.     It's sort of a multifactor, is he coordinating, is he under the supervision, is he really doing public service?     I mean, if the idea is to give him sufficient breathing room so he doesn't stop, and when, as in this case, he's threatened that we're going to sue you if you do this, he has to think, well, now, am I being supervised by the government?     Am I coordinating with the government?     Or I -- am I telling them what -- it -- the test itself undermines the asserted purpose.       Lawyers are not supposed to be cowed by the exigencies of the situation. We're worried in qualified immunity with protecting governmental actors, to make sure they will feel comfortable doing the right thing rather than being intimidated in the situation we had here. Lawyers have that professional obligation in the first place.     So, why does a lawyer need the -- the defense of qualified immunity?       That's all right. Ms. Saharsky. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       So, if they don't work closely together at all and it's just this one fellow conducting the investigation, he wouldn't have qualified immunity?       I'm sorry.     No, he --       -- I'm wrong, or no --       So, what -- what if it's a 100 percent purely volunteer fire department?     I mean, the town, whatever, contracts, out-sources, whatever, but it's just run by volunteers.     Is your answer the same? I'm trying to get at your point about they're working with or coordinating with government employees.     And your argument seems a little derivative. You're saying the whole point is to protect the government employees, and you have to have qualified immunity for the non-employee to do that.     But does your argument apply when there are no government employees around?       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Millett, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-1024 +++$+++       We'll hear argument 4     next in Case 10-1024, Federal Aviation Administration v. 5     Cooper. Mr. Feigin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
10-1042 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1042, Freeman v. Quicken Loans. Mr. Russell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       I -- your argument that "percentage" can include 100 percent is certainly true as a matter of logic.     But in the phrase "portion, split, or percentage," I think the more natural reading of "percentage" is something less than 100 percent.     In other words, you're apportioning or you're splitting the fee with somebody else.       You could have -- "portion" I suppose could still mean a full portion; "split" probably not.     But, I mean, the more natural reading is surely a division.       But the -- one reason -- one objection to your idea that, well, this covers partial, so it must cover 100 percent, is that it's a very different issue if you're talking about partial and 100 percent.     If you're talking about partial, you have a classic case of a -- a kickback. But if you suddenly say 100 percent of an unearned fee, that's a much more difficult question to decide. In this case, for example, you get a whole bunch of things from Quicken Loans, including the loan and all this other stuff, and it's kind of hard to single out, well, this part is unearned but this part is earned; it's kind of a whole package.     When you have a portion or split, it's an entirely different issue.       Yes, but there -- it's a more -- it's a narrower issue when you're talking about a portion.     Let's say the kickback goes to the appraiser.     Maybe you can decide in that case whether the loan company really had anything to do with the appraisal at all. When the alleged unearned fee goes to the whole loan company, it's a little harder to say which part was unearned and which parts might have been earned.       It's just -- it's the way these loans work, right?     I mean, it's the same thing whether you pay 10 percent and no points or 9 percent and 3 points.     You know, which one of those is earned or unearned, it's kind of hard to sort it out.       Thank you, Mr. Russell. Ms. O'Connell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS       What does that mean? In other words, the rate that was offered -- they said you pay two points and you will get a rate of 8 percent.     And you're saying that even if they didn't pay the two points, they would still get a rate of 8 percent?       Mr. Russell, you have 5 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
10-1062 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1062, Sackett v. The Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Schiff. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAMIEN M. SCHIFF ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       What if the sanction imposed each day was not the $37,000, but was $10?     If you don't comply, you know, we can bring an action any time to enforce this, and you'll be subject to the statutory maximum, but during the period, the additional sanction for the -- under the administrative order, or the compliance order, is $10 a day.       But it might go to adequacy of judicial review, the adequacy of the judicial review that would come when the EPA brings the enforcement action.     I understood your argument to be that there was a significant extortion impact from the fact that these were such significant fines -- double, as you say -- that you could rack up for 5 years.     But if it's only $10 a day, that takes a lot of the wind out of your sails, doesn't it?       Could the -- I don't understand what exactly you might get from the Army Corps of Engineers.     Obviously, they might give you a permit, and I take it that cuts off liability; you can do what you're hoping to do.     They might say you don't get a permit because these are wetlands.     Can they do something in the middle, which is:     It's kind of hard for us to tell; you're on your own?       Well, you -- would collateral estoppel apply to you because of the judicial determination on the compliance order in the subsequent enforcement action?     In other words, you lose.     You seek APA review, and the court says, you know, we think it's a wetland.     And then the EPA brings an enforcement action.     They have to establish it's a wetland.     Don't they just attach a copy of the decision?       Well, not -- I guess I'm back to Justice Scalia's question.     This -- it struck me as a purely legal, jurisdictional issue:     Are these wetlands or not?     And I don't know why you would give deference to the agency's determination on a legal jurisdictional issue like that.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Schiff, you have 4 minutes remaining.

FRANKLIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       I don't -- I don't understand your answer to Justice Kagan.     If I heard you right, you were saying, well, they're going to be able to get a certificate because it's an Eighth Amendment violation, and everything is very severe.     But the point is they're going to bring a negligence action, not an Eighth Amendment action.       So --       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shah. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS       It is -- a Bivens action is unusual in the first place, but it's also unusual to say that you don't have a Federal cause of action because of something a State gives you. Do you have any other example of something like that, where the availability of Federal relief turns on the availability of alternative relief under State law?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Franklin, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
10-1121 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1121, Knox v. The Service Employees International Union. Mr. Young. ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. YOUNG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       And the reason that's important in terms of the content of the notice, the inadequacy, is what?       I thought your --       I thought your argument was that the -- a different type of notice would have resulted in more members electing to opt out, to demand the refund of their assessments?       Maybe it's a good point for you to move to the merits.       Without -- but without regard to the reason for the assessment?       Well, I'm not sure that -- this may just simply be repeating Justice Sotomayor's question, but if they say we have to raise the assessment 10 percent because, as she said, you know, we estimated the printing costs for the union newsletter, whatever, was going to be this and it turns out they raised it, it's going to be that; so, we know we're going to have to get additional money, for things that are indisputably chargeable, why do you need special procedures in that case?       Go ahead.       Do they -- do they carry over from one year to the next, or do you have to refile your objection to the union expenditures every year?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Young, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. YOUNG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Briefly, counsel.
10-114 +++$+++        We will hear argument next in Case 10-114, Fox v. Vice. Mr. Rosenkranz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       That's an incredible burden to impose on the district court.     It's hard enough for clients to read through these billing records and figure out what's valid and what's not, but to ask the district court to then go through and look at it, and see -- and maybe it doesn't say, you know, "1983 suit," "State suit."     Maybe it's just an entry.     And then you've got to go through entry by entry and say well, now, was that for the 1983 action or was that for the State court action?       And that seems - just -- sorry, I don't mean to drone on, but that seems to me to be an especially odd burden to impose when you're dealing with an area where there is a heavy dose of discretion to the district court in the first place.       Well, maybe in your case, but there's no reason to suppose there won't be cases where the things are flipped, and the Federal claim, perhaps frivolous for a legal reason rather than a factual one, is the dominant driving force in the litigation and you've tagged on a few other State claims.       But that's a pretty audacious claim, that you filed such a frivolous cause of action that they shouldn't have wasted so much time responding to it.       That's a lot of chutzpah.       And you shouldn't have filed it. (Laughter.)       Can I clarify what you mean by "completely intertwined"?     You mean there is no incremental work just on the Federal action?       So you -- you're looking for fees -- your first argument -- even though they can identify fees that were incurred solely on defending the frivolous cause of action?       All right.     That's an easier case.     What if it's 20 percent spent on the Federal action?     Do you still completely intertwine?       What if it's not completely frivolous, but frivolous enough to satisfy a demand for fees?     What if it does take them, you know, hours to prepare the motion to dismiss it as frivolous?     Do they get those 40 hours?       Well, you've got to find the 17 cases.       You've got to look carefully at the facts.     They assume good faith on the part of their adversary that would not file a frivolous claim.     The idea that it's going to be able to - they're going to look at it and say, this is frivolous, file a motion in Federal court, I think that's a - doesn't reflect an adequate -- doesn't reflect a realistic understanding of Federal litigation.       No, that's not how it works.     You say they know they're going to be seeking claims.     They don't know in advance, this is going to be a frivolous claim, the discovery is going to be completely overlapping or it's not going to be overlapping.     And most lawyers do not keep detailed accurate billing records.     That's just an underlying reality. So I do think it's a significant burden on the district court to say, go back and read these - read these billing sheets, figure out which is which, presumably have litigation over it.     Someone is going to file a motion for these fees; the other person is going to say, no, no, it shouldn't be 20,000, it should be 15,000.     And our precedent in this area gives a huge amount of discretion to the district courts, just reasonableness.     And it seems to me you're buying into a lot of litigation to decide whether it's 20,000 or 15,000.       I understand you go back to the first point.       Mr. Rosenkranz, I'm looking at the billing sheet, August 14, 2007, 32 hours, miscellaneous cost, online research.     Is that for Federal or State?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rosenkranz, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       I was wondering kind of as a starting point, and I don't know why you would fight so vigorously against the verbal formulation "fairly attributable."     I assume most district courts, when they get it, they're going to start by looking at whatever his affidavit, this is how much our fees were, and then if there's some reason, perhaps Mr. Stancil's case, where everybody thinks it's a Federal that's all, or maybe not, then they can just go "fairly attributable" rather than but-for, which gives the district court a lot more leeway and the sort of leeway we have always held in this area they should have.

Yes.    Yes.      Well, that -- I 20     understand that -- that proposition.    Assuming that 21     distinction is correct and that there is no      Because I take it that at that point everybody can immediately -- defendants can remove -- never mind.    Cross that off. 3                 What benefit do you have if as soon as you 4     file your action, everybody says congratulations, you 5     have Federal jurisdiction, and you're kicked out of 6     court because you have no cause of action?      No, no.    I'm 11     assuming that we don't see a cause --      But why is that? 3     Wouldn't the -- I think you're fighting Justice Breyer's 4     hypothetical.    Wouldn't the -- I can imagine if you've 5     got a, you know, small claim type case because you got 6     the -- one of these calls, and the first thing you get 7     is the notice of removal and this.    I mean, you're going 8     to say forget about it; I'm not going to hire a lawyer. 9     Right?    I mean, the idea is they would drop it right away.      But is it just when 25     the action can be brought in State court or when the      Yes.      What you can 16     always --      So, if -- could an 21     individual -- you say there's a Federal cause of action 22     in this case apart from the State cause of action that's 23     provided.    Could that Federal cause of action be brought 24     in State court even though the State cause of action 25     could not be?      Got it, got it.    But 9     just to follow up.    The cause of action could be brought 10     in both, except if the State courts say it can't be 11     brought there.    The State cause of action can't be 12     brought in State court because of this "if otherwise 13     permitted," right? The Federal cause of action, though -- I 15     thought the State courts couldn't discriminate against 16     the Federal cause of action, any Federal cause of 17     action.    So, you can sue in State court and say:    I'm 18     bringing my Federal cause of action; so, the fact that 19     you don't permit a State cause of action doesn't bar me. 20                 MR. NELSON:    Again, I think that the premise 21     of the question is really not correct.      But that's fine. 7     That may be exactly right.    But the cause of action 8     under subsection (3) asks whether or not this action -- 9     it provides an action that can be brought in State court if otherwise permitted, right?      What about --      What about a 4     diversity action?    You could not bring this action in 5     State court because it's contrary to the law, the rules 6     of the court of that State, but there's diversity.    Can 7     you bring that diversity action in Federal court? 8                 MR. NELSON      Counsel, do you 20     know -- do you know why the Solicitor General is not 21     here defending the proposition that Federal law provides 22     a Federal cause of action that can be brought in Federal 23     court?      Mr. Nelson, you have 19     4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON 21                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER      Are you arguing only 22     about "arising under" jurisdiction or are you arguing 23     also about a Federal cause of action that can be brought 24     in Federal court?    In other words, I am trying to figure 25     out what we're being asked to decide in this odd case. I understand the idea -- and I'm sorry to take up your 2     time -- I understand the idea that this is a Federal 3     question because it's created by a Federal law. Can you go -- get into Federal court, and 5     then we'll have another case about whether you can bring 6     a cause of action there?
10-1211 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 10-1211, Vartelas v. Holder. Mr. Bibas. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANOS BIBAS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       So, your expectations argument is that somebody trying to figure out whether to go ahead and rob the bank is going to say, well, if I do and I'm caught and I'm found guilty, I won't be able to take temporary trips abroad; so, I'm not going to rob the bank.       Well, you're concerned under Landgraf, I think, with whether or not it disrupts settled expectations.     And it just doesn't seem to me that this issue enters into the expectations at all when the pertinent act, which is the commission of the crime, not the pleading guilty, takes place.       I would have thought your answer to my colleague would be:     No, what they want to regulate is the staying in the country, and they're trying to make that as uncomfortable as possible in order to encourage the individual to leave.     If he can't go to the, you know, parent's party, the cousin's wedding or whatever, he's just going to leave, and then once he does, he can't come back. Why would -- why would the Government care -- it's a question for them, I'm sure.     Why would they care whether somebody that they don't want to be here stays here?     It seems to me the exact opposite. So, I would have thought your argument -- your answer would be, no, what they're trying to regulate is not the coming and going, but simply the staying.       Does it matter in the examples that you just gave that admission to the United States is purely a matter of legislative grace, while we might conclude that teaching, being a member of the bar, whatever, is not?       I'm sorry.     What -- an which privilege was that?       Suppose that might have been regarded as such then but not under current law.       When they decide to plead guilty?       The operative issue here is when they commit the crime.       So, this -- so, this --       Mr. Bibas, you have 6 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANOS BIBAS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-1219 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 10-1219, Kappos v. Hyatt. Ms. Anders. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       What if -- what if the new evidence is in reaction to the PTO's ruling? The PTO says:     Look, we're not -- we're not going to issue a patent because you didn't show us that, you know, the valve in the back of the thing or whatever was -- was novel, and we think that's important.     So -- and the applicant goes to, under 145, to the district court and said:     Well, I didn't submit that evidence because I didn't have any idea that that was going to be a significant issue, and I'm -- you know, I'm sorry, but, you know, I have a good basis for not thinking of that, and here it is. Is that the type of new evidence that could be admitted?       So, this is an exception?     I thought you were telling us earlier you generally can't get --       Oh.       Thank you, Mr. Panner. Ms. Anders, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-1259 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1259, United States v. Jones. Mr. Dreeben. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Knotts, though, seems to me much more like traditional surveillance. You're following the car, and the beeper just helps you follow it from a -- from a slightly greater distance. That was 30 years ago.     The technology is very different, and you get a lot more information from the GPS surveillance than you do from following a beeper.       But that's a good example of the change in technology.     That's a lot of work to follow the car.     They've got to listen to the beeper; when they lose it, they've got to call in the helicopter.     Here they just sit back in the station, and they -- they push a button whenever they want to find out where the car is.     They look at data from a month and find out everywhere it's been in the past month. That -- that seems to me dramatically different.       You think there would also not be a search if you put a GPS device on all of our cars, monitored our movements for a month? You think you're entitled to do that under your theory?       Yes. (Laughter.)       So, your answer is yes, you could tomorrow decide that you put a GPS device on every one of our cars, follow us for a month; no problem under the Constitution?       Well, then you're -- you're moving away from your argument.     Your argument is it doesn't depend how much suspicion you have; it doesn't depend on how urgent it is.     Your argument is you can do it, period.     You don't have to give any reason.     It doesn't have to be limited in any way, right?       Well, isn't the normal way in these situations that we draw these limits how intrusive the search can be, how long it can be, is by having a magistrate spell it out in a warrant?       Well, you're talking about the difference between seeing a little tile and seeing a mosaic.     The one gives you information; the other doesn't.       If you get an anonymous tip that there's the same bomb in somebody's house, do you get a warrant or do -- do you just go in?       Right.     Well, why are you asking for a different rule in this situation?       What if we -- I give you that, that it's in public.     Does the reasonable expectation of privacy trump that fact?     In other words, if we ask people, do you think it's -- it violates your right to privacy to have this kind of information acquired, and everybody says yes, is it a response that, no, that takes place in public, or is it simply the reasonable expectation of privacy regardless of the fact that it takes place in public?       You can see, though, can't you, that 30 years ago if you asked people does it violate your privacy to be followed by a beeper, the police following you, you might get one answer, while today if you ask people does it violate your right to privacy to know that the police can have a record of every movement you made in the past month, they might see that differently?       Mr. Dreeben, 5 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-1261 +++$+++  
10-1265 +++$+++       I suppose you don't 16     think that the standard of review is abuse of discretion, because if you do, then I suppose you're 18     assuming that the district court has discretion whether 19     to grant the motion or not instead of being confined by 20     a particular standard.
10-1293 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 10-1293, Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations. General Verrilli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Finish your sentence, please.
10-1320 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 10-1320, Blueford v. Arkansas. Mr. Sloan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD M. SLOAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, it's --       I'm sorry.     Go ahead.       Right, but that's the final say.     You don't know what the jury did as a preliminary matter.     I would think it in a case like this perfectly reasonable for the jury to say:     Let's take a preliminary vote; we'll go down; and if -- if we all agree on something right away, that's what we'll do. Does everybody agree on capital murder?     No, some don't.     Does everybody agree on murder?     No.     Does everybody agree on manslaughter?     Yes.     Okay, we all know that manslaughter, he's at least guilty.     Now let's go back and talk about the more serious offense, and some of us will try to persuade the holdouts. And yet, you would say as soon as they reached the point of saying, yes, he's guilty on manslaughter, they can't go back.       You've talked about our manifest necessity decisions.     It's true that we -- isn't it, that we said last year we have never reversed the district courts' exercise of discretion under the manifest necessity standard?       Yes.       In -- and under that -- I'm sorry.     Go ahead.       I don't want to -- I'm sorry for taking up your time, but your friend says you did not object when the judge announced that he was going to declare a mistrial; is that correct?       Thank you, General. Mr. Sloan, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD M. SLOAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-1399 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 10-1399, Roberts v. Sea-Land Services. Mr. Gillelan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA T. GILLELAN, II, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       When -- one of the arguments on the other side that I thought made some sense was the idea that you should focus on a particular point in time when you're figuring out what the amount of the award is going to be; that it doesn't make -- that it's at least odd to say, well, we're going to calculate how much you're entitled to at this point, but in terms of the applicable maximum, we're going to wait however long it takes and calculate that as of this point.     Doesn't it make more sense to figure out the applicable numbers at the same point in time?       So, if we think -- if we think the statute -- in other words, your argument, your response, is that the statute is unambiguous and it can't be read --       -- in a more sensical way.       Okay.       It's not a serious --       Go ahead.     You've been -- you've been waiting the longest. (Laughter.)       Thank you, counsel.
10-1472 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 10-1472, Kouichi Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Limited. Mr. Fried. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL S. FRIED ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, that -- but she's not interpreting it.     She's already got the thing in whatever language they're -- English, I guess.     But, I mean, she's not interpreting; she's reading the English translation.       Oh, I misunderstood the hypothetical, then.     I'm sorry.       I thought it was a situation where you've got a -- a document in -- in, say, French and the person translates it or interprets it -- I don't want to prejudge the issue -- and -- and then -- in English and then the person reads the English thing in -- in court.     That's not interpretation at any point, is it?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fried, you have 5 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL S. FRIED ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-1491 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1491, Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum. Mr. Hoffman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       You began by -- by --       If -- if there is no other country where this suit could have been brought, regardless of what American domestic law provides, isn't it a legitimate concern that allowing the suit itself contravenes international law?       But it was motivated, I gather, by assaults on ambassadors here within the United States.       Thank you, Mr. Hoffman. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS       But whether -- I'm sorry.       But under international law, it is critically pertinent who's -- who's undertaking the conduct that is alleged to violate international norms.     If an individual private group seizes a ship, it's piracy.     If the navy does it, it's not.     Governmental torture violates international norms. Private conduct does not. So, why doesn't the -- why isn't the same pertinence -- your argument seems to be that all you need to do is find an event, torture, piracy, whatever, and then it's up to the domestic law whether or not particular entities can be sued.       As a statement of your position.       But it doesn't work when you're talking about state -- whether it's a state conducting the illegal conduct or somebody else.     So, why -- that's not up to the domestic --       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hoffman, you have 5 minutes remaining.       I'm sorry.     In every nation in the world, you can get redress for this sort of thing, but I thought you told us earlier that there was no place where this suit could be brought --       In other words, a suit by an alien against another alien for conduct that takes place overseas.       Well, that just gets back to your basic submission, which is you define the international norm based on the act rather than the entire issue that's going to be litigated, which includes both remedy and actor.
10-1542 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1542, Holder v. Gutierrez, and the consolidated case. Ms. Kruger. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       You say that you think the statute is unambiguous, but it -- it doesn't address issues of imputation at all, does it?       Well, if it doesn't even address it, it seems to me the best you can say is that it's ambiguous.       Thank you. Ms. Kruger, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Counsel, in response to Justice Kennedy's question about whether they gave a policy reason, your answer was that they, you know, followed the history.     I'm not sure that's the same as a policy.
10-174 +++$+++        We'll hear argument today in Case 10-174, American Electric Power Company v. Connecticut, et al. Mr. Keisler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       I think that's -       That's exactly one thing that's concerned me.     They do all flow from the same basic argument, and I'm concerned why you think we should focus on prudential standing, basically, which cuts off our jurisdiction at our own whim, as opposed to dealing with this on the merits.       In either case, your argument is that this is too generalized for the Court to -- to address.       So how many States does it take?     I think, you know, if it's three States who have made that allegation, I don't know exactly how you draw the line between a case like Tennessee Copper and this case.       Thank you, Mr. Keisler. General Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY, IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS       Counsel, you don't usually -- your phrase is exactly what bothers me.     We don't usually base a decision on our general intuition, and the idea of prudential standing that we have jurisdiction of the case but we're not going to decide it is contrary to Chief Justice Marshall's famous line that if we don't have jurisdiction, we can't decide it, but if we do, we have to decide it.       I'll give that you on the zone of interests, but there you're dealing with administrative law and a very narrow proposition.     I think it's Justice Kennedy's point, or at least the point of his questions, that these issues meld into the merits and, at least for anyone who is troubled by the idea that we are not going to decide a case even though we have jurisdiction to decide it, maybe that's the better place to address it.       Why is it -- I don't want to make -- try to make a case for you, but why is it that much more difficult?     It's just -- I mean, it's sort of like the negative commerce clause, right?     The fact that EPA has the authority to regulate in a particular area means that the ball has passed from the courts to the agency, to the executive branch, and they've made an implicit decision not to regulate a particular question.       I guess that would be a preemption question rather than -- rather than a displacement question.       Thank you, General Underwood. Mr. Keisler, you have five minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
10-179 +++$+++        We'll now hear argument in Case 10-179, Stern v. Marshall. Mr. Richland. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       This is a little - it's a little different when you're talking about the right to have a -- a decision before an Article III tribunal.     It seems a bit more fundamental than the examples you're giving.       Well, not -- not fundamental in the sense of is it important or not.     I guess "fundamental" is not the right word.     Maybe "structural" or -- or something like that.     It's sort of the whole basis for the decision that's going to be made.       Well, that just means that the district court is acting in concert with Congress -- take action that undermines the long-term institutional and constitutional basis of the judiciary. And the district courts have their different reasons and incentives to do that.     That doesn't mean that all bets are off, and just because they're involved in the process it's not a concern.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Richland, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-188 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 10-188, Schindler Elevator Corporation v. United States ex rel. Daniel Kirk. Mr. Reiss. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN ALAN REISS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       It doesn't sound like in normal parlance if you come to an agency and say I want these documents, and the person comes down and says here they are, he's not going to say here's my report.     He's going to say here are the documents you asked for; this is our response.       There's information, facts, that you can glean from their action, but that doesn't make what they've done a report.       Is your position that sometimes it can't -- a FOIA response can be a report and other times it's not?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Reiss, you have 14 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN ALAN REISS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-209 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-209, Lafler v. Cooper. Mr. Bursch. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, "sacred" is a little strong, don't you think?     I mean, it is a -- to some extent, unfair to the prosecutor because he knows already he's got a guilty verdict in his pocket, and he has to go back.     But why is it so terribly difficult to tell the defendant he has a right to accept that offer if he wants, but then go through the normal process, which is it has to be approved by a judge and all that stuff?     I don't see what's terribly difficult about that.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jay. ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       Sure.       Thank you, counsel.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bursch, 4 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, counsel. Counsel.
10-218 +++$+++       Well, maybe it 13     demonstrates the non-navigability of the particular 14     stretch, but we would still speak of the transfer of 15     commerce as being along the river.      The sort of case -- 18     the analogy I was thinking of is if I say I fly from 19     Washington to Tokyo; and someone says, no, you didn't, 20     you flew to San Francisco, then you walked however many 21     yards from one gate to another, and then you flew to 22     Tokyo.    And I would say, well, yes, there's a gap there 23     when I -- you know, part of the distance where I wasn't 24     flying, but people would still say you flew from D.C. to 25     Tokyo.    Now, why isn't this just like that, that the commercial path, the commercial waterway people think of 2     as the Missouri?    And, yes, occasionally you've got to 3     get out, and, you know, we can debate how long the 4     portage is, but it doesn't interrupt the notion that 5     that whole pathway would qualify as a navigable 6     waterway.      Thank you, counsel. 4                 Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 7                     SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER      I think, though, if 20     you start drawing these lines, they become very difficult, in some rivers anyway, to -- to apply.    I'm 22     sure there are seasonable fluctuations.    They may be 23     navigable in some seasons, but not in others.    The line 24     at which you pass from navigability to non-navigability 25     may be difficult to ascertain. It seems to me, once you start chopping the 2     highway of commerce up, it does create all those 3     difficulties.      Your answer a moment 24     ago gives me pause.    You said the United States would 25     not be bound by this litigation but could bring its own quiet title action.      It's kind of odd. 8     Maybe this is -- maybe this is Justice Alito's earlier 9     question.    It's kind of odd that the more navigable the 10     river is, the more claim the State has.    The less navigable -- where you're talking about sports boats and 12     drift fishing -- then it's Federal.      Thank you, counsel. 24                 Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining. 25               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-224 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-224, National Meat Association v. Harris. Mr. Wells. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. WELLS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       I would have thought that your argument on sales would apply at the front end as well.     You say sales can't be regulated because it's really just a way to get to the regulation of what goes on at the slaughterhouse.     Wouldn't that concern also apply at the front end?       Well, that -- isn't that logically not -- doesn't that logically not follow? You may not sell meat if it's been adulterated doesn't mean that you can sell meat so long as it's not been adulterated; right?       One is a limitation, not a grant.       Thank you, counsel.

10-235 +++$+++        We will hear argument next this morning in case 10-235, CSX Transportation v. MCBride. Mr. Rothfeld. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       I just don't -- and maybe this has already been asked, but I'm not sure from a juror's perspective that it makes terribly much difference the exact formulation of this instruction.     I think a juror who sees an employee is suing the railroad, and it turns out that what the railroad did had very little or nothing to do with what happened to the employee, they don't need an instruction about natural, foreseeable causes.     They're just not going to give the awards, or they're going to give the awards even though the railroad didn't do anything that affected the employee. It's a -- it's a nuance that I just don't think has any practical significance.       My point is that I don't see much practical difference between what you argue is the correct instruction and what your friend argues is the correct instruction.       I mean, law students, professors, and some judges have had trouble defining the concept of proximate cause for centuries. I don't know why we expect a juror to be able to navigate through those nuances, either.       And do you want - what instruction would you give that would tell the jury to allow damages in one of those -- the first of the coupling cases, but not in the second?       Are jurors going to sit there and say, one of those is natural, foreseeable, and probable, but the other isn't?       I don't know what "natural" means.     You know, so it's not a supernatural situation? (Laughter.)       It's not foreseeable that if you drop a coupling where it's not supposed to be, somebody will come along and try to pick it up and move it?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rothfeld, you have 4 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.

10-277 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-277, Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes. Mr. Boutrous. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE J. BOUTROUS, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       I suppose if corporate headquarters had learned that the subjective decisionmaking or the delegation of decisionmaking to the field was resulting in several discriminatory practices or a pattern of discrimination -- in other words, the decentralized process was leading to discrimination -- then I suppose the company -- that that could be attributed to the policy adopted by -- at headquarters?       No, I'm talking about -- so, they've got thousands of stores, and, you know, every week they get a report from another store saying that, you know, there's an allegation of gender discrimination.     At some point, can't they conclude that it is their policy of decentralizing decisionmaking that is causing or permitting that discrimination to take place?       What -- what happens to the damages claim of an individual woman who is part of this class if that class prevails?       Would -- would she be eligible for only back pay or compensatory damages as well?       I'm sorry.     Go ahead.       All right.     But would -- would the -- would the women with a claim for compensatory damages be able to sue that after the class prevails in this case?       Even -- even though she could have not received notice and not had an opportunity to opt out?       What if the class does -- does not prevail; it loses?     Does that bar an individual woman at a particular Wal-Mart from bringing these same claims?       But what if it were the same theory, that the reason this person was able to discriminate was because he had total subjective discretion in his hiring?       Thank you, counsel.

And if I -- I want to nail this deal down as soon as possible. I mean, that would be a reason to -- to move things up and get the plea in early, wouldn't it?

10-5258 +++$+++        We will hear argument next this morning in Case 10-5258, MCNeill v. United States. Mr. Gordon. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN C. GORDON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       What if the State -       What if the State change is to abolish the offense altogether?     Do we - do we not have any predicate offense for the defendant who committed the crime prior to the abolition of the State offense?       Well, but it strikes me that there's really no change in the State view of how serious it is.     It was just an overall change in how they're going to look at sentencing.     Under the prior regime, you're sentenced to a particular term, but in fact you serve a lot less.     With the new treatment in sentencing, you're sentenced to what is a much -- a smaller term, but you in fact are going to serve the whole thing.     At the end of the day, there's no real change in how they view the seriousness of the offense.       Thank you, Mr. Gannon. Mr. Gordon, you have 6 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN C. GORDON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

CAHN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       What if -- putting aside the particular statement here, what if a judge says:     I appreciate that one purpose of punishment is deterrence; that's what -- and that's what's going to guide me, and I think you will not be deterred if I only sentence you for 2 years, but I think if you have to go away for 3 years, you will appreciate that what you've done is wrong and you won't do it again. Is that for rehabilitation, that extra year, or is it for punishment?       Well, maybe -- what is the difference between deterrence and rehabilitation? The person doesn't commit any crimes anymore but wishes -- wishes she could?     Or -- and, well, if she's rehabilitated, she doesn't want to?     It seems to me it's a very artificial distinction.       Thank you. Mr. Cahn, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF REUBEN C. CAHN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-5443 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 10-5443, Fowler v. United States. Mr. Crawford. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. CRAWFORD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       What is -- what is your position on the subsequent element or -- or feature about relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense?     Does the defendant have to know that his actions to prevent communication involve an underlying Federal offense?       Why is that? 1512(g)(2) talks about with respect to the law enforcement officer.       I would have thought you'd say there's a negative implication that intent has to be shown with respect to everything else, including whether or not this is a possible Federal crime.       Are you willing to concede that the defendant knew that?       Thank you, counsel.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Crawford, you have 7 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. CRAWFORD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-545 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 10-545, Golan v. Holder. Mr. Falzone. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY T. FALZONE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Under your -- under your theory, let's say you have a copyright that expires on October 5th, okay?     On October 4th, Congress could extend that for 25 years.       Right?     But on October 6th, they couldn't go back and extend it 1 day.       What about new categories?     You know, architecture.     Congress decides we're going to extend copyright protection to architectural design, and they say:     And we're going to go back 5 years.     So, any new architectural design conceived or constructed, whatever, within the last 5 years gets protection, and it goes on for another 15.       No, no, I know.       No, no, I'm just trying to -- I'm trying to test the limit of your public domain --       -- argument.     Does it extend to new categories of copyrightable works?       Well, one way it could, I suppose, is that it shows that Congress is interested in making sure that American authors overseas have reciprocal protection, an issue that could come out in a variety of contexts.     And if I'm sitting there writing a great novel, I will have the confidence that my government will ensure that I get protection when it becomes a bestseller in China.       Right?     Well, that's -- that's an incentive.       No, I'm talking about -- but the same issue can come up again, you know, whether it's in the area of formalities or whatever. There may be another problem where there's a dispute between other countries and our country.     And I will know that, in the past, the United States has taken action looking out for -- for the interests of American authors.       That's an incentive. Now, it may be, as I think it was described in a court of appeals decision, a "meager" incentive.     You may be more interested in other protection.     But it's -- we haven't really required much more than that.       Thank you, counsel.       Thank you, General. Mr. Falzone, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY T. FALZONE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
10-553 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-553, Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Mr. Laycock. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS LAYCOCK ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Counsel, you referred to the ministerial exception, but, of course, your position extends beyond ministers.     How do we -- how do we decide who's covered by the ministerial exception and who is not?       Well, let's say it's a teacher who teaches only purely secular subjects but leads the class in grace before lunch.     Is that somebody who would be covered by the ministerial exception?       Well, different churches have different ideas about who's a minister. There are some churches who think all of our adherents are ministers of our faith.     Now, does that mean that everybody who's a member of that church qualifies as a minister because that is part of the church's belief?       Every one of our adherents stands as a witness to our beliefs.     And that -- you know, not every church is hierarchical in terms of different offices.       Thank you, Mr. Dellinger. Mr.     Laycock, 2 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS LAYCOCK ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-568 +++$+++        Our last argument of the term is in Case 10-568, Nevada Commission on Ethics v. Carrigan. Mr. Elwood. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       You modified your answer to Justice Scalia by saying you're not aware of any case that applied the First Amendment to rules of general -- neutral rules of general applicability, I think.     But if the First Amendment doesn't apply, that doesn't matter, does it?     You can't limit your -- the type of rules that you say are not -- are okay and are not if the First Amendment doesn't apply at all?       Well, if the First Amendment doesn't apply to this type of activity, then you would have no First Amendment objection to biased rules of specific applicability.       I thought your position was that this wasn't speech protected by the First Amendment.       So someone can challenge one of these rules on the grounds that it's not neutral, that it applies in a disproportionate way to particular members of the legislature?       Do you think that the rules in the House of Representatives allocating time on the floor or committee membership are neutral? They're biased in favor of whichever party happens to be in the majority.       I suppose you would have a First Amendment claim under your theory if the generally applicable rule was applied in a discriminatory manner; it turned out, you go back and look and over the last 2 years the only people who have been sanctioned for violating the ethics rules have been members of the minority party.       That would be a viable First Amendment -       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Elwood, you have 5 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10-6 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 10-6, Global-Tech Appliances v. SEB S.A. Mr. Dunnegan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM DUNNEGAN ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS       Is your -       I'm sorry.       Is your position when you're -- when you're talking about willful blindness or purpose, whatever, is that with respect to a particular patent, or is it with respect to infringement of a patent? I don't think it's true with deep fryers, but in some areas, you almost always know you're going to hit something, that given the nature of the industry, you're going to infringe something.     Is that enough?       But that's -- I mean, I understand you're in the deep fryer industry, but that standard would bring the semiconductor industry to a halt.       I think the -- the problem is, even if you do do your diligence, given the way patents are these days, if there are 420,000, you're never going to know with any degree of comfort that you're not going to infringe something.       But we might decide that it's more important to consider what's going to happen to the semiconductor industry in articulating our standard than what's going to happen to the deep-fryer industry.       And why is that - how is that different from knowing?     I -- I -- my impression was the same as Justice Kennedy's.     I thought you wanted the knowing standard.       Well, you're talking -       But if you're -- I'm sorry.     I do not want to interfere with your time.       I'll wait.       Thank you, Mr. Cruz. Mr. Dunnegan, you have four minutes remaining.

GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       You talk about the State's role.     I assume that you're talking about there is the failure to take action after the return of the notices.       Well, put -- putting that -- that to one side, what if only one of the three notices had been returned?       Right.       What if -- but -- your case it seems to me turns critically on Butler's role.     How much, in addition to what he did or didn't do, would he have to do to put him in a position where he was in fact representing Maples in your view?       What if -- the New York lawyers did not abandon Mr. Maples prior to the time that they left their law firm in New York, right?       So, their conduct prior to that time would be attributed to him, right?       Right.     Part of their conduct was setting up their arrangement with Mr. Butler where he would show up as counsel of record but not really do anything.     So, why aren't the consequences of that arrangement attributed to Maples as well?       Thank you, counsel. Thank you. Mr. Garre, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-637 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 10-637, Greene v. Fisher. Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Mr. Fisher, we wouldn't have this problem, at least not in this case, if your client had -- had sought cert, right?     Because then presumably when his petition came before the Court, our normal practice would have been to GVR it, because the decision would come out the other way under -- under Gray, right?       No, if he had sought cert.       We can't very well GVR it until he seeks cert.       And I think it's kind of a glaring factual nuance to the case, kind of a -- that he didn't seek cert.     And he also didn't seek State collateral review.     I mean, if he had tried one of those or both of those, we -- we probably wouldn't be here.       I would think our normal --       Normally, I think if it looks like a mess procedurally, or whatever, the normal assumption is you let the lower court figure it out.     Send it back, and I -- I think the research is that in actually most cases in which we GVR, the court reinstates the judgment below for one reason or -- or another.     But the idea that we parse through them carefully -- I think if it's arguable, send it back and let the lower court sort it out.      The problem is that --      You would be I appreciate your point that you may or may not have been able to bring it.    My -- my concern is that you have, I guess as someone put it, the perfect storm here.    You have a person who did not file cert, and he could well have gotten relief if he had through the GVR process, and who did not seek State collateral review, and he could well have -- you say probably wouldn't.    The State said certainly would have.    Somewhere in there.    At least he'd have had a fair chance --       -- or a chance.     But because he didn't seek cert and he didn't file State collateral relief, we have this more complicated scenario.      Well, but, I mean, it seems to me that AEDPA contemplates that.    It refers to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.     So, naturally, you'd have a different result with respect to claims that were adjudicated on direct review and any claim that was pushed over to collateral review.       Well, I'm sorry, but I mean, my point is that it seems a pretty weak criticism of a result that it requires you to go claim by claim, when the statute specifically requires you to go claim by claim.       The objection there it seems to me would have to be with Congress.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-6549 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 10-6549, Reynolds v. United States. Ms. Cain. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CANDACE CAIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Was the -- is the Wetterling Act retroactive?       No, no, I know. That's going forward.     But was the requirement to register under the Wetterling Act -- did that apply as of the enactment date or did that reach back?       So, you think it only applied to that year?       So, if the offense were committed in 1994, did that person have to register under the Wetterling Act?       You have -       You have a notice - notice and comment claim, right?       No, that's not - no.     Your argument, as I understand it, is there was no notice and comment when he issued the interim rule.       If there had been notice and comment, you would have jumped in with comments that would have convinced the Attorney General not to apply the rule to your client.       Okay.       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Cain, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CANDACE CAIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

ANDERS ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       Counsel, I wonder why you just agreed that the 7 hours would be a pertinent circumstance.     It strikes me that that would be a pertinent circumstance on overall voluntariness, perhaps, but once you're told you can leave whenever you want, I don't see why it matters at all how long he's kept there.       So, it's not a relevant circumstance on the custody question.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bursch, you have 6 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-694 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 10-694, Judulang v. Holder. Mr. Fleming. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       I understand the advice of counsel, but what is the reasonable expectation of that's been altered?       So, you're saying -       -- that the expectation is when he pleads guilty to a violent felony, that he expects, well, if I'm deported because of that I am going to be able to seek discretionary waiver?       What is the -       Right.     Okay.       How often are these waivers granted?       But in terms of the expectation interest, we have to visualize someone who is facing a serious charge and is entering a plea bargain, where presumably the consideration of what he's pleading to, how much of a sentence he's going to get, all that, are dominant considerations.     And he's also going to say:     Well, I've been advised that I will be able to apply for a discretionary waiver.     So, I'm going to plead guilty. That's a fairly unlikely scenario, isn't it?       No, no.     I'm not questioning the fact that he was advised, but presumably the lawyer will also advise him:     Oh, and you also have to pay the $250, you know, restitution, whatever, fee. I am just questioning how significant that advice will be when someone's determining whether to plead guilty or not to a violent felony.       Thank you, Mr. Gannon. Mr. Fleming, you have 6 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-699 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-699, Zivotofsky v. Clinton. Mr. Lewin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, Medellin involved a situation where the President's purported exercise of authority changed domestic law, and not simply domestic law, but domestic State law.     That seems to me to be quite a distinguishable circumstance.       What -- so, you're suggesting that the outcome of this of case would be different, from your perspective, if Congress said you have to say "Jerusalem, Israel."       Why is it -- why is it a different case?       So, would there be -- there would be a greater concern -- the concern on the part of the executive that there would be adverse political reaction would have a greater degree of credibility?       And so, we're supposed to decide whether or not the executive is correct in saying that it's a significant problem.     And he says, well, he says that, but we know foreign policy better; we don't think it's going to be a big deal.       I don't see Justice Jackson's analysis -- what he's saying -- and I guess I don't think it's as controlling as others might.     He's saying when there's a conflict, it's a harder case.       When there's -- when they agree, it's an easy case.     When you can't tell, it's sort of a middle case.     I don't see how that's very helpful in resolving the dispute before us.       But it's recognizing that principle only with respect to a particular jurisdiction.     An American citizen born in Northern Ireland doesn't have this option, because he thinks that's part of Ireland.       And your -- and your friend on behalf of the United States says that's because of a State Department judgment that in one situation, it's significant; in the other, it's not.

10-779 +++$+++        We will hear argument first this morning -- this morning in Case 10-779, William Sorrell, Attorney General of Vermont, v. IMS Health Incorporated. Ms. Asay. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIDGET C. ASAY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       The purpose -- the purpose is to prevent sales representatives from contacting particular physicians, right?       You want to lower - you want to lower your health care costs, not by direct regulation, but by restricting the flow of information to the doctors, by, to use a pejorative word, but by censoring what they can hear to make sure they don't have full information, so they will do what you want them to do when it comes to prescribing drugs, because you can't take, I gather, direct action and tell them, you must prescribe generics, right?       You're restricting their -- you're -- you're making it far more burdensome for the manufacturers to reach their intended audience, right?     It's as if I want -- there's a demonstration in town, all right?     They need a permit to hold the demonstration.     They get the permit.     I want to hold a counter-demonstration, and you're saying it doesn't make any difference whether I know where their demonstration is going to be or not?       Well, we'll -- we'll give you -- we seem to have questions.     We'll give you additional time for rebuttal, so you don't -- don't worry that we're cutting into that. But you're making a judgment about how their -- whether or not their speech will be as effective or not.     Don't you think they're the ones who are entitled to make that judgment?     It doesn't mean that you're right or wrong.     It just means that we would not rely on your determination that it is -- their speech is just as effective.     They're the ones doing the speaking and they think it's not.       We'll afford you 5 minutes for rebuttal. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING the PETITIONERS       So he's required to provide it, but he would be required to provide it quite apart from the government regulation, right?     I mean, the pharmacy needs to know who to make the prescription out to.       I thought our precedents made -- indicated that it's problematic for the State to make a determination about what uses information can be -- to what uses information can be put, particularly when it's an interested party as it is here.       I thought you told me that -- I thought you told me that this doesn't protect physician privacy to the extent of saying this information can't be used for academic purposes even if you, the physician, don't want it to be used for those purposes?       So the physician doesn't get to decide for what uses the information -       What if the statute -- I'm sorry.     What if the statute said this information can be used for any number of purposes, except not for anybody who is going to criticize the State of Vermont?       This information - this information cannot be used for any purposes -- can be used for any purposes except a purpose that will make things more expensive for the State of Vermont?       What if you say -       Let's say I don't like to be bothered by people knocking on my door by saying, sign this petition.     Can I -- to protect my privacy interests, can I prevent that as a general matter?       Yes.       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Asay, you have five minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIDGET C. ASAY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Ms. Asay, I want to give you the chance to respond to a point that was highlighted by your friend, which is the fourth legislative finding, which does seem to say that the State is doing this because it doesn't like an imbalance in the marketplace of ideas.       Do we have -- were there -- were there findings with respect to the statute as enacted?       I take it there's - there's -- it's against the law for a physician to say I want you to fill this prescription in a particular place, a particular pharmacy because I know that pharmacy doesn't sell the information.     They can't do that, can they?
10-788 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-788, Rehberg v. Paulk. Mr. Pincus. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       A person?     What -- what if you have three elements to a crime, and you have one witness for each one.     You see somebody sees the guy trying to get into a car.     Well, maybe he left it -- maybe he locked his keys in.     Another sees the guy walking around with a television.     It might be his.     A third sees the guy selling the television to somebody else.     There's nothing wrong with that.     Each one testifies before the grand jury.     Who is the complaining witness?       Urges -- urges a prosecution.     One area that causes me concern here are the domestic violence cases, where someone may well report an episode but, by the time it gets to whatever the indictment procedure is, a grand jury or otherwise, is unwilling to -- to testify and pursue it.     And yet, that person may be the one who started the prosecution in motion.     Is that individual a complaining witness?       No, he says -- he or she says at the time, I -- I don't want prosecution to go forward.     I -- you know, I would prefer that it not go forward.       Well, I thought the whole point of the grand jury was to protect citizens from unwarranted prosecutions.     The grand jury initiates the prosecution.     So, why do we look back beyond that? That's where the prosecution is initiated.     You're not subject to prosecution until the grand jury returns the indictment.     So, why do we talk about complaining witnesses initiating the prosecution?       Well, somebody's is not --       No, go ahead.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Pincus, you have 4 minutes.

HORWICH 9                  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,      What about an APA 3     action against the FDA for relying on the use code? 4     Couldn't that be challenged as arbitrary and capricious? 5                 MR. HORWICH On the other hand, if in -- going back to my 12     answer to Justice Kennedy, if we're talking about kind 13     of the second scenario where FDA does engage in substantive patent review, yes, FDA could get sued.    But 15     the problem with that is that FDA is going to get sued 16     in an APA suit; the real parties in interest are going 17     to be the generic and the brand.    FDA is not going to be 18     owed any deference because it's going to turn on a 19     matter of claim construction, which is a question of 20     law.

And you're free to cross-examine about what went on at Cellmark, and a jury 12     is free to say, well, I believe the circumstantial 13     evidence about what happened.    Or the defense counsel 14     can say, why don't they have anybody here from Cellmark? 15     And a jury can say, well, yes, that's a good point. 16                 It just seems to me that nobody from      Thank you, counsel. 9                 Mr. Carroll, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN W. CARROLL 11                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER      You do think our law 7     is established, though, that a jury will follow an 8     instruction in this situation to -- not to take the 9     testimony for truth of the evidence, for truth of the matter.      Do we have any -- 14     any case saying that instruction is inadequate in a case 15     like this?
10-875 +++$+++       We'll hear argument 4     first this morning in Case 10-875, Hall v. United 5     States. Ms. Freeman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN M. FREEMAN 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS      Well, but I mean, 18     your -- it is a question for you, because these things 19     don't go for 2 or 3 years, do they?    I thought typically 20     they are wrapped up very quickly, and that's to the 21     advantage of the debtor.    And your position with respect 22     to postpetition taxes has the potential of extending 23     them beyond the kind of quick turnaround that helps 24     everybody.

10-879 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 10-879, Kurns v. Railroad Friction Products Corporation. Mr. Frederick. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Well, but, counsel, looking at Napier, the power that Justice Brandeis said was conferred in that case was to specify the sort of equipment to be used on locomotives, right?       So, this is equipment that was used in locomotives.       Yes, but that's the same -- that's the same thing, I'll give you that, fitness for service.       It doesn't say something that's going to cause harm while it's actually being used.       Why does it depend -- you want to know if this equipment is safe to operate, right?     To be used, whether -- whether it's going to be used.     If you have a --       If you have a boiler that's going to be used, that's within the power that was confirmed.     It's not merely to inspect as, again, Justice Brandeis said.       Well, I guess your argument isn't limited to being taken apart.     Your argument does depend on the fact that the asbestos doesn't come out during use; right?       Well, how do we know that --       Yes, but if there's an accident or something, does the asbestos come out during the use of the locomotive?       Well, that's the old insurance cases we've had, that, you know, when the car, you know, slams into a pole or something, it's not being used as a car anymore; and, therefore, the insurance doesn't cover it.       Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Ms. Harrington. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS       Well, but if you're talking about -- I bet there are a lot of things on railroad cars that you can fix in the shop or you can fix while it's under way, right?     We're not always talking about brakes.     So, let's suppose there's one of those things.     You get to the shop and the guy says: Boy, you got to fix this.     And they said:     Well, the train's leaving, and we're going to go in 10 hours.     And he says:     Okay, I can fix it during the -- while it's in use.     Is that covered or not?       So, the line you've been talking about between the repair shop and the locomotive on the tracks, that's not really the line at all.       Well, then -- well, then what's the answer to my question?     This is something you can fix in either place.     It's covered while it's -- if you fix it while the train is under way, but it's not covered if you wait until it's in the shop?       So, then it's not whether it's in use or in the shop.     It's whether it is something that affects whether the locomotive can go, whether it's --       Thank you, counsel.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick, you have 4 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       And it knows -- it knows about Napier and what's been going on for 85 years, and if it wants to pull back on the pre-emptive effect of the provisions interpreted in Napier, it's free to do that, too.
10-895 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case No. 10-895, Gonzalez v. Thaler. Ms. Millett. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       What if he had identified a constitutional issue, speedy trial issue? Does that give the court the authority to consider a different constitutional issue, a Fourth Amendment issue?       So, what if it identifies something that is not remotely a Federal constitutional issue?     By the terms of the COA, it's quite clear, you know, whether it is a State law issue or something else.     There's no constitutional plausibility on the face of it. Does that still work for you?      Ms. Millett, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       I just have a -- I don't understand the 99 percent figure.     That includes people who entered a plea bargain and presumably gave up the right to appeal?       So, 99 percent of the convictions that are entered.     So, that would include all the plea bargains.     Those people obviously didn't appeal, is what --
10-8974 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first today in Case 10-8974, Perry v. New Hampshire. Mr. Guerriero. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD GUERRIERO ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Why isn't it -- this may be -- just, again, following up on Justice Alito's question, but there's always a degree of suggestiveness. It's not like the person is, you know, picked randomly off the street and saying, you know, do you know this person?     It's in the context of an investigation.     The person has some contact with it.     So, there's always some suggestiveness that, well, this person might have something to do with what went on.       But whenever -- whenever the witness is asked, at least there's a suggestion that this might be the man.     And I don't know why you would think that's any greater than this is the man.     The police don't come up usually and say, this is the person that we think did it; is that who you saw? They say, did you see this guy?       Well, what about a situation like the one we had here, where you're not talking about a line-up?       But you're talking about the scene of a crime, and the police says, do you know this person, did you see this person, or anything else?     That in itself, any type of identification in the course of an investigation, I think you would have to say is suggestive, because the person is not picked up randomly.       So, this is -- again, this is just following up, I guess.     But I remember in law school one of the things in criminal law, the professor says, all right, everybody be quiet. And then a certain amount of time goes by, and then he starts asking people, well, how much time went by?     And people -- some people say 4 minutes, some people say, you know, 1 minute.     And it turns out, if I'm remembering correctly, to be a lot shorter than most people think. So, that's at least, the point was trying to be made anyway, at least as unreliable as eyewitness testimony.     So, your argument would have to cover that, wouldn't it?       You know, how long were you there before this individual came into the shop?     The person says, I was there for 5 minutes.     And that ruins the person's alibi, when it turns out, you know, study after study would say, you know, it really was 45 seconds or 1 minute.       Thank you, counsel.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Guerriero, you have 2 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD GUERRIERO ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

HORNE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       When treatment begins after some sort of initial hearing, right?       Why is it -- I don't mean to be nit-picking, but why is it 6 to 9 months?     8 months -- I mean, why isn't it 6 months?     Or 9 months? I don't understand why there's --       So 6 months?     Or 9 months?     What does it mean to be 6 to 9 months?       Thank you, General.       Ms. O'Connell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS IN NOS. 11-218 & 10-930       You said shortly after a reasonable period of time.     I thought you were saying after a year.     I think it's -- it's some guidance to say no more than a year.     It's really no guidance to say after a reasonable time.       What is the standard when the district court is deciding whether to stay the proceedings?     We've heard a number of them, plausible basis in the record, truly plausible, Iqbal.     Which -- which -- what is the government's position on the appropriate standard?       "Could"?       Your standard is "could provide"?       You don't mean -- you're not suggesting that don't abuse your discretion is a limit, are you?       Thank you, counsel. General Horne, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C.

10-945 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-945, Florence v. The Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington. Mr. Goldstein. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Counsel, is there - there is a distinction between the simple strip search and the visual body cavity search.     You say that they apply reasonable suspicion standard to the visual body cavity search.       So, is the visual cavity search therefore off the table?       Right, right.     But you would say that they had to have a reasonable articulable suspicion before they could do that?       So -- so, you see a distinction between what they actually do and the written policy.       Right.       Counsel -       Counsel, my understanding of the statistics -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- is that they get about 70 new people going through this process a day.     Is there anything in the record about how much additional time it would require to look at each one, to look at their record, to determine which category they should fall into, to strip search or not, as opposed to having a blanket rule?       We'll give you rebuttal time, but maybe just to be clear -       -- you don't -- do you or do you not have an objection to the superseding ECCF policy?       That's the current policy?       And you have no problem with that.       I mean, you have no problem with the reasonable, articulable suspicion aspect of the body cavity search.       Okay.     And with respect to the simple strip search -       -- your only objection is that the guard is too close to the inmate?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein, take 4 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-948 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 10-948, CompuCredit Corporation v. Greenwood. Mr. MCConnell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. MCCONNELL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Do you think a -- the word "lawsuit" typically describes an arbitration proceeding?     If you're subject to an arbitration, would you say, I'm in a lawsuit?       Well, why doesn't a right to sue refer to a lawsuit?       One way you could do it is that the right to sue is more familiar colloquially.     If somebody, you know, hits your car and you jump out angrily and say -- you can say:     I'm going to sue you.     You're not likely to say:     I'm going to bring a cause of action against you. (Laughter.)       Could you in an agreement waive the provisions of 1679g(b) that specify what a court shall consider in awarding punitive damages?       No, well what -- what if you don't want your arbitrator to consider those four requirements?     Could you waive particular aspects? I mean, that tells you that -- first of all, it says, of course, "the court shall consider"; but I take it your position is when they say "the court," they mean the court or arbitrator?       Well, one of those rules of construction is that you don't read statutes when -- to the extent they lead to absurd results.     I mean, I think you can still say follow the plain language, but that doesn't mean you go so far as to say you can't enter into a settlement.       Thank you, counsel.
10-9646 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-9646, Miller v. Alabama. Mr. Stevenson. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN A. STEVENSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Any idea how many juveniles subject to a sentence of life without parole do plead to a lesser sentence?       Right.       Is there any reason, just -- I realize it's speculation, but wouldn't you think prosecutors would view that as a particularly attractive offer to someone who's young in the sense that they may regard the sentence as extraordinary themselves, that it may be particularly attractive to someone who's young in a way that it wouldn't be a 40-year-old, a -- an offer of 25 years may not be as attractive as it is to a 15-year-old?       It might be also a basis for -- to question the statistics you put forward about how often -       -- this sentence is actually imposed.     In other words, the evolving standards of decency you suggest -- the prosecutors in the State may not be immune to that evolution, either.       Well, but those statistics aren't very helpful because we have no idea in the particular cases as to whether or not perhaps the older offender was less -- less guilty than the 16-, 17-, 15-year-old.       Thank you, Mr. Neiman. Mr. Stevenson, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN A. STEVENSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       What if they -- what if they do?     I mean, what if, after our decision or even after the argument, States go back and say, look, the decision is based on the fact that they don't think we know our law, that we haven't thought about it; so, let's have a hearing about it, and then we vote that, yes, there should be or, no, there should not be a minimum age; we think at 16 -- whatever age they do. Then does the constitutional rule change?       Once we get 30 States saying, look, we've thought about it and this is our answer, then whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits it or not changes?       Right.     But one of the things we take into account is societal consensus, and you say we should ignore the 30 -- whatever it is -- States that allow this because they didn't really think about it.       So, I'm postulating -       -- let's make -- let's see if they have thought about it.

We can decide this case without relying on the distinction you just discussed, can't we?                   What about --                   It also says "clerk."   We may not be judges, but we certainly have a clerk.                   I take it the usual practice is for the parties to settle this matter and submit an agreed amount to the Special Master; is that correct?                     So why didn't -- - then are we here?    We are talking about limited amounts. So much more is at stake on the merits and why wouldn't the parties just say, well, when it comes to Special Master fees this is what we are going to agree to.                     It doesn't have to be limited to $40.                  You can agree as part of a global settlement to whatever you want.                   I haven't seen -- I mean the $40 limitation makes absolutely no sense, does it?     I mean I never saw an expert who would agree to spend the day appearing in court worth being called an "expert" for $40. I mean the fact that -- I guess I'm just repeating Justice Scalia's question.                      The fact that Congress has picked an arbitrary number with no basis in reality doesn't mean that we should do the same.                    When we award the -- the special master's fees in original cases, do we specify who will bear those fees?                    Do we include the special master's fees as part of the costs that are allocated?                    Well, why -- why did the parties agree to it if we do it?                      In other words, if we say in our orders who bears the special master's fees, why -- why would the parties agree to it?                   Right.                      You mean Congress has done that?                   Thank you, General. General Six, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE SIX ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
11-10189 +++$+++        We will hear next this morning in Case 11-10189, Trevino v. Thaler. Mr. Wolf? ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN A. WOLF ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       The district court, the trial court?       Has the Texas -- have the Texas appellate courts ever sent a -- a claim back for an evidentiary hearing?       So as far as you know, the court -- the appellate court's never done that?       Okay.     Why does Page 6 Texas afford people in your client's position a new appellate counsel?       Well, your friend says, page 18 of his brief, that you do.     He says, Page 15 "Under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 21, direct appeal counsel can supplement the record with evidence developed by investigators and experts, the ones that are appointed and paid for by the State on appeal." Now, is that just wrong?       Okay.       Oh, surely -- surely, the trial court in Texas, when it gets a new trial motion within 30 days, and the new counsel on appeal says, well, I have reason to believe -- well, we can see that there wasn't an adequate investigation of mitigating circumstances or whatever made below, and I would like the time to conduct -- you know, the psychological evaluation or to contact these witnesses, is the trial court going to say no?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wolf, you have seven minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN A. WOLF ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Justice Kennedy.       Well, what are -- what are these investigators, experts, they're available to the new appellate counsel, what -- what are they supposed to be doing?       Yes, the direct appeal attorney.     You say -- basically, you're saying there's no way they can do anything within these time limits, and, yet, the State procedure provides for investigators and experts.     It seems to me it would be odd for them to provide for people and to pay for people who can't do anything.
11-1025 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1025, Clapper v. Amnesty International. General Verrilli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       I don't see how that is pertinent.     What you're saying is they don't have standing to challenge program A because they may also be injured under program B.     And do you have an example of a case where we've held that?       Well, there again, it depends how you phrase their injury.     If you phrase their injury as being subject to surveillance under a particular statutory provision that they think is facially invalid, saying that, well, you're not going to get any relief because you're going to be subject to surveillance under a different provision, I mean, they may say, well, we may, or we may not, but we still have the right to cure the injury of being subject to surveillance under 1881a.       Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
11-10362 +++$+++       We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-10362, Millbrook v. United States. Mr. Paolella. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. PAOLELLA, FOR PETITIONER, APPOINTED BY THIS COURT       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG, FOR RESPONDENT, SUPPORTING REVERSAL AND REMAND       Thank you, counsel.       Mr. Paolella, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. PAOLELLA, FOR PETITIONER, APPOINTED BY THIS COURT
11-1059 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1059, Genesis HealthCare v. Symczyk. Mr. Mann. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MANN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Counsel, what if the district court -- this proceeding -- you filed the suggestion of -- of mootness, whatever, and the judge says, okay, I have this suggestion of mootness, I also want to address the certification issue, the mootness argument is scheduled for three months down the road, the certification issue for two months down the road; isn't this just a question of what order the district court wants to address these two issues?       Justice Kennedy.       Counsel, I don't know that you've answered my question sometime ago, but what -- if the judge can simply order the two determinations in a way that certification is addressed before mootness, does that take care of your problem? Obviously, if you grant certification, there is an ongoing controversy.     And under Roper and Geraghty, if you deny certification, the relation-back doctrine applies.       Well, there's no doubt that --       I'm sorry.     There's no doubt that that -- in that situation, the case goes forward, right?       Mr. Mann, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MANN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
11-1085 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 11-1085, Amgen, Incorporated, v. The Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds. Mr. Waxman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Why -- why is that -- why is that the case?     I would suppose, if there's no materiality, that means that the effect on the market price just happens to be zero.       Well, why isn't that common to all parties?       So at certification, you just assume that materiality -- you don't have to show it.     If it's always a common question, you assume it, in trying to weigh out the number of -- whether or not common issues predominate or not.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman, you have 5 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
11-1118 +++$+++        We will hear argument next this morning in Case Number 11-1118, Gunn v. Minton. Ms. Webre? ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANE WEBRE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       What about just the -- just the flip side of this case?     Let's suppose they said, the one -- no, you don't need an expert.     So it's not belt and suspenders; it's neither belt nor suspenders. That's going to affect the conduct of the lawyers in the State in the way that would be disruptive of -- of the uniformity of Federal patent law.       Well, right, the requirements of the Federal law.     The question is there's going to be a different interpretation of what that means in the State court and in the Federal circuit.
11-1160 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1160, the Federal Trade Commission v. Phoebe Putney Health System. Mr. Horwich? ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Just so I understand your answer to Justice Ginsburg, you're saying there would be a difference if the charter said the authority may require -- acquire any properties to fulfill its mission and if it said the authority may acquire properties to promote its mission?       So you think a general saying they may acquire properties doesn't implicitly say they may acquire all properties? That seems a pretty thin --       Well, you've already told us that there can be State action for some purposes and not others.       So the fact that you have examples where you might conclude, no, they didn't mean to do that, doesn't seem to categorically suggest that you prevail with respect to another one of the powers that are granted.       I -- this may be completely wrong.     You can tell me.     I would -- would doubt that, in counties or municipalities of this size, you are going to have -- you know, five hospitals, and so that a -- the authority could acquire a hospital and yet still it not have any significant merger consequences on its face. In other words, when this law was passed, giving them the power to acquire hospitals, wasn't it the case that there would likely be only one other hospital or two, so that any acquisition of another hospital would have the merger consequences that this one had?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Horwich, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11-1175 +++$+++        We will hear argument next in Case 11-1175, Marx v. General Revenue Corporation. Ms. Zieve. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       Well, that's a pretty odd way to balance.     I mean, if you're -- if you're trying to balance, then you say, well, here's an idea, let's give them attorney's fees, but let's not give them costs.       That's a very curious way to dilute what was otherwise a defendant-friendly provision.      Finish that sentence.       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Zieve, you have six minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11-1221 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1221, Hillman v. Maretta. Mr. Ruttenberg? ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL H. RUTTENBERG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ruttenberg, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL H. RUTTENBERG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11-1231 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1231, Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Mr. Kneedler, there's a little bit of at least facial incongruity in your position. Congress sets in place the 180-day limit. Then you say, oh, well, that, we can go beyond that. The Secretary puts in the 3-year limit, and you say that's it -- you know, that's the dead drop-off.     I would have thought what Congress says is entitled to greater weight than what the Secretary says.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11-1274 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1274, Gabelli and Alpert v. the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Liman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS LIMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Liman, you have 5 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS LIMAN ON BEHALF OF THE Petitioners       I'm sorry.     What case?
11-1285 +++$+++        We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-1285, US Airways v. MCCutchen. Mr. Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Was the plan available to the employee at any time before this litigation?       Are they -- are they advised that they can ask for the plan?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11-1327 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 11-1327, Evans v. Michigan. Mr. Moran. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       One -- one of the reasons we've said that underlies Double Jeopardy clause is to prevent overbearing conduct by the government. That's not an issue here, is it?     You said the government gets one fair shot at conviction.     And if there has been a legal error below, they haven't had a fair shot.       Well, this business about the judge being a representative of the state, I'm not sure how far that gets you.     The government is one of the adversaries appearing before the judge, and the judge is not supposed to take the government's side.     So he is not really a part of the government.     And it does seem to me that, if they had been thrown out of court because of a legal error, that's not a fair shot.       No, I know that -- I'm just saying that that particular rationale for the Double Jeopardy Clause is not applicable in this case.       That's looking at it from the defendant's perspective.     We have said that the government should have one fair shot at conviction.     And it seems to me that, if they lose because of an error, that's not a fair shot.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Moran, you have five minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, counsel.
11-1347 +++$+++        We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-1347, Chafin v. Chafin. Mr. Manely. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. MANELY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       I thought you said that that time period was tolled -- the period that she was in Scotland would be tolled.       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER       Counsel, do you agree with your -- with the Petitioner, just reading a sentence from its brief, that "mootness requires that relief be impossible"?     Do you think that's the right standard?       What this Court -- Court has always said, if it's an Article 3 inquiry under standing, and it said that it's not supported by injury that is speculative or conjectural.     It seems to me, when you start talking about, well, the Scottish court might do this or the Alabama courts might do this, that -- that sounds pretty speculative and conjectural.       So do you think it's -- I mean, I know you've got a laundry list of things, but, as I understand it, you think it's enough that, if the Court issues an opinion, the Scottish court might do something as a result of that?       I thought one of the arguments, maybe it was the Petitioner's and not yours, was that one reason it wasn't moot is because the Scottish courts might look at the case differently.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Manely, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. MANELY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, that sounds awfully speculative and conjectural.     That doesn't sound -- whether you're analyzing it under standing in the first instance or mootness later, that doesn't sound to be the sort of concrete injury that's required.
11-1351 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1351, Levin v. United States. Mr. Feldman? ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       I don't quite understand your answer to Justice Ginsburg on the "for purposes of this section." What the section does is provide that the remedy against the United States is exclusive.     But what the 1089(e) goes on to say is that the 26 -- the 2680(h) provision doesn't apply.     So I don't see how that -- I mean, the -- the reference is to the exclusivity, not to the waiver of the limitation on -- on intentional torts.       Justice --       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feldman, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Mr. Feldman, the Court invited you to brief and argue this case as an amicus curiae, and you have ably discharged that responsibility, for which the Court is grateful.
11-139 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-139, United States v. Home Concrete & Supply. Mr. Stewart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, but only if your reading of the Colony decision is correct, right? If we think that Colony definitively resolved the question before you, the regulation can't overturn that.       Well, if they use the exact same phrase, and it's a fairly detailed -- it's not just a normal phrase they might use elsewhere, I think it's reasonable to assume that that phrase came in with the baggage it -- it carried from the Colony case; right?       Well, about that argument, you rely very heavily on the fact that Justice Harlan used the term "ambiguous," right?       But he was writing very much in a pre-Chevron world.     I -- he was certainly not on notice that that was a term of art or would become a term of art.     And, of course, I didn't know him, but my sense is he was very gracious and polite. And you can see him saying, well, that's a good argument, but....     He's not the sort of person who would say this is it, this is it. I don't think you necessarily can take the use of the word "unambiguous" in his opinion to mean what it does today.       Is there -- is there a case where we applied Chevron deference to a pre-Chevron opinion?     In other words saying, well, the Court looked at that, but the Court said it was ambiguous; and so, we apply Chevron.       Well, yes, that's the general principle.     But the point you made just a few moments ago is -- I think is responsive to that, which is:     We're not talking about the merits; we're talking about a statute of limitations.     The whole point of a statute of limitations is some things that are bad are -- are -- are gone.       You can't go back to them.       At what -- at what level of the IRS bureaucracy can you feel comfortable that the advice you're getting is correct?       A single district counsel -- you go to there and say, what do you think? And it tells you, and you say, well, that's fine, but I know you don't count; so, I want to talk to your boss and boss -- (Laughter.)       So -- so, what that -- what happened here is that the taxpayer came to the same conclusion as a district counsel of the IRS.       Mr. Stewart, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Mr. Stewart, I know you've got a -- your third point, and I want to let you get it out, but you mentioned Brand X.     Have we ever applied Brand X to one of our decisions?     Have we ever said an agency by regulation can alter and change one -- a Supreme Court decision?       Well, but that was applying it to a court of appeals decision.       Right.     We've never said an agency can change what we've said the law means.
11-1425 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case Number 11-1425, Missouri v. MCNeely. Mr. Koester. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN N. KOESTER, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       In some cases I suppose the judges actually want to read the affidavit and give it some thought.     It's not going to be 3 minutes.      Members of the Court have intruded on your rebuttal time, including me, so we will give you a little extra.       You can finish your thought.      Thank you, counsel. Mr. Koester, you have -- we'll give you three minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN N. KOESTER, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11-1447 +++$+++        We will hear argument next this morning in Case 11-1447, Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District. Mr. Beard? ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. BEARD, II, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       And I will afford you some additional time, since our questioning intruded on yours.       Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Beard, you have three minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. BEARD, II, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Finish your thought.       Thank you, counsel.
11-1450 +++$+++        We will hear argument next in Case 11-1450, the Standard Fire Insurance Company v. Knowles. Mr. Boutrous. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE J. BOUTROUS, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Would your position be the same if the issue were not the amount sought but rather the substantive claims?     Say there are two different claims the class member -- the class could raise.     One would yield damages of $4,900,000.     The other would yield damages of $10 million.     Do you have the same objection in a case in which the prospective representative only pleads the first claim?       Well, but you do seem to have a difficulty with your position about how far it goes.     You make the point in your briefs about the statute of limitations question.     In other words, it's not just how much they claim, but where they decide to cut off the statute of limitations and so forth. It seems to me that it's a bit of a slippery slope if you start saying we're going to look at what the class could -- could recover in deciding whether or not, not simply whether or not this representative is adequate, but whether or not it's below or above, above or below $5 million.       Your approach leads to particularly perverse results.     You're at the position of arguing that -- you know, they are seeking less than $5 million, but we're responsible for a lot more damage than that.     And of course, you don't concede it, but you do say, if in fact we're liable, the damages are going to be a lot greater.     Could -- I assume that admission could be used against you under principles of judicial estoppel.       I'm sorry.       Let's go by seniority.     Justice Alito.       Well, you're assuming that it's a bad thing for the class members to have their claims limited.     But it may well be a good thing for them to have their claims limited if that gets them into what would reasonably be regarded as a more sympathetic forum.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Boutrous, you have four minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE J. BOUTROUS, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       (Nods.)
11-1518 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in case 11-1518, Bullock v. Bank Champaign. Mr. Byrne? ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. BYRNE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, I mean, it's often the case that -- that children don't want to go into the family business and it's often the case that some of them do and some of them don't and the idea that one of the children who wants to put the money back in the family business is -- you know, you wouldn't think that was wrong when the other children want to take the money out or put it somewhere else.     That's not at all unusual.       But there is a shortage of accounts at the end of the day.     It's just a question of what day it is.     When he takes -- takes the stuff and it's a lost -- it's either viewed as a lost opportunity or an increase in the risk to the beneficiary, and that's a loss to them at that point. The fact -- it's like a bank robber giving back the money.     There is no loss to the bank, but it's still crime.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Byrne, you have five minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. BYRNE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11-1545 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1545, City of Arlington, Texas v. The Federal Communications Commission and the consolidated case. Mr. Goldstein? ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       So your understanding of jurisdiction and what you're arguing for today is nothing more or less than this is a provision as to which Congress did not give the agency law-making authority.     You do not defer to the agency with respect to this provision because it's outside its jurisdiction in the sense that it gets deference.       Right.     Now, the reason -- the reason we are hearing all about jurisdiction and it's kind of dressed up --       -- is simply because the means by which Congress made clear it was not giving the FCC authority to get deference, however that is phrased, is this 7(a), which speaks about nothing will limit the authority of the States.       If it weren't for that, if it were some other type of provision, that -- we wouldn't call it jurisdiction, but we would just say, the FCC doesn't get deference to it.
11-159 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-159, Astrue v. Capato. Mr. Miller. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, they don't always do --       Counsel --       You said earlier that the State intestacy law provides clear rules, but I assume that's not always the case, particularly with all this new technological advancement.     There must be situations where you can't tell what State intestacy law provides.     And what does the Social Security Administration do in that case?       No.     My hypothetical is that there's no clear answer.     I mean, let's take a situation where this type of reproduction is -- is new, and the State legislatures haven't had a chance to decide whether they want to recognize the offspring for State intestacy law or not.     What would SSA do?       Mr. Miller, you have minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11-161 +++$+++        We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-161, Armour v. City of Indianapolis. Mr. Stancil. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Counsel, some - some time ago, I thought you were just about to tell us how much money the city says will be at stake if you prevail.       And the -- the city says that's the total amount that's at issue if you prevail, if the taxpayers prevail on this claim.       Is there an easier thing to administer than the system that was struck down in Allegheny Pittsburgh?       Whatever you paid, that's what your assessment was.     And they argued, well, this is easy; that's enough.     And this Court said, no, it's an equal protection violation.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stancil, you have 4 minutes remaining.

11-166 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-166, RadLAX Gateway Hotel v. Amalgamated Bank. Mr. Neff. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. NEFF ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Well, isn't that -- isn't that pretty much what he bargained for when he insisted upon security before giving the loan?       Well, you're depriving the secured creditor of the opportunity to hold on to the asset because he thinks it is, for perhaps a short period, unreasonably devalued.     Right?       Did -- did I cut off your answer to Justice Alito?       Well -- Well, this is a case, though, where you would not want the asset sold.     In other words, looking at it, he thinks, for particular, unusual situations, this is vastly undervalued; I am holding an asset that is going to appreciate if I hold onto it.     So he doesn't want the asset sold.       And what -- what is the doubtless equivalent of his claim?     Measured by the current market conditions?     Or does that include some premium, based on the assumption that it's going to increase in value over some period?       Mr. Neff, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. NEFF ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       If -- please.
11-182 +++$+++        We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-182, Arizona v. The United States. Mr. Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Counsel, maybe it's a good time to talk about some of the other sections, in particular Section 5(C). Now, that does seem to expand beyond the Federal government's determination about the types of sanctions that should govern the employment relationship. You talk about supply and demand.     The Federal government, of course, prohibits the employment, but it also imposes sanctions with respect to application for work.     And the state of Arizona, in this case, is imposing some significantly greater sanctions.       We'll give you plenty of rebuttal time, but I'd like to hear what you have to say about Section 3 before you sit down.       Justice Alito.       Mr. Clement, 5 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Finish your sentence.
11-184 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-184, Kloeckner v. Solis. Mr. Schnapper. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Mr. Schnapper --       But the critical point, I gather, is what standard of review the district court will apply to that exhaustion question, or the bar question, right? I assume you think that the standard review in the district court is going to be more favorable to your client than the standard -- the arbitrary and capricious standard that would be applicable in the Federal circuit? I guess --       Even if you give up your CSRA claim, they can assert that defense?       Suppose -- I'm sorry.       So I suppose if you say, I was fired on the basis of race, and the agency says, no, you were fired because you were incompetent, you could take the incompetence claim to the MSPB, and if you win, saying, no, you were perfectly competent, they shouldn't have fired you, you get that relief and you don't need to proceed with the discrimination --       Thank you, Ms. Harrington. Mr. Schnapper you have 4 minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       You better remind me. (Laughter).       Fifth.       No, no.     I -- I just --       You are on number five.
11-192 +++$+++        We will now hear argument in Case 11-192, United States v. Bormes. Mr. Srinivasan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, then it's really the specific governing the general, but the other way around, right?     The Tucker Act discusses specifically the liability and the sovereign immunity of the United States, and if the statute just generally doesn't address it, then the Tucker Act is the specific one and the other statute is the general one.       You'd win under this argument, too, right?       You win under this argument, too.     It just seems to me that it's not quite right to say that FCRA -- FCRA does not specifically address the liability of the United States.       The Tucker Act does. So the Tucker Act is the one that's specific, and it applies instead of the general language in the -- in FCRA.
11-199 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-199, Vasquez v. United States. Mr. Brindley. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BEAU B. BRINDLEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Could I --       -- stop you there? I -- where in the Government's brief do you see the statement that the analysis should not look to the error, should not include the error?       Where -- where --       Where exactly is that in their brief?     That the -- the question is whether a jury would convict him without considering the error.     Because I look at the Government's brief, and they have fairly extensive analysis of -- of the error, why they think it's not important, why they -- you know. But I don't see them saying you don't look at the error at all.       Yes, exactly.     In other words, you look at the prejudicial effect of the erroneously admitted evidence and see if that altered the outcome.       They say -- immediately after the sentence you gave us, they say "looking at the evidence as a whole."       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Brindley, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BEAU R. BRINDLEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11-204 +++$+++        We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-204, Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham. Mr. Goldstein. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Well, doesn't that just -- I mean, that's when the doctors are there.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS       Do you -- I'm sorry to interrupt your answer, but does your office review the amicus filings in the courts of appeals by the agencies?       Is that the normal procedure?       Well, but you -- you didn't even know about that.       And yet, you expect the industry to know all about it; and yet, it escaped your attention.
11-210 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-210, United States v. Alvarez. General Verrilli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, where do you stop?     I mean, there are many things that people know about themselves that are objectively verifiable where Congress would have an interest in protecting.     High school diploma.     It is a crime to state that you have a high school diploma if you know that you don't.     That's something you can check pretty easily.     And Congress can say:     We want people to finish high school.     It's a big thing to have a high school diploma.     So, we want to make sure nobody goes around saying they do when they don't. What about that case?       The substantial interest is the one that I've just said.       Could I -- I want to follow up on Justice Scalia's question because I'm not sure I understood.     The Government's position is that there is no First Amendment value in a false representation of fact, by which I understand you to mean not parody or something like that, but a statement that's intended to be understood as true.     There is no First Amendment value in that statement.     It may be protected because of the "breathing space" argument, but in whatever context, in whatever guise, there's no protection in that false representation as such.       And I suppose it might have something to do with -- I don't know whether to call it collateral or not.     I mean, I would think the concern in the midst of a political campaign is you have the U.S. attorney or the deputy district attorney bringing a -- filing a prosecution of someone 2 weeks before the election saying, well, you lied about this or that.     And maybe there'd have to be a deposition, or maybe there'd have to be a trial.     I don't -- nothing like that's involved here.       Oh, yes.
11-246 +++$+++        We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-246, Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak. Mr. Miller. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 11-247       Just to interrupt, in other words, it's not to the title.       I'm sorry.       Well, they didn't here.     I mean, when Patchak filed his suit, title had not yet passed to the Secretary.     And he sought a stay.       But nothing -- at that point, you thought nothing prevented the Secretary from moving forward, and in fact, the Secretary did move forward even though he'd already filed the suit.       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Millett. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 11-246       Could I say, just for a moment, let's suppose the tribe -- the -- Mr. Patchak brings a nuisance action against the tribe for running a casino and imposing all these difficulties on the surrounding previously rural community.     He says this is a nuisance. And the tribe answers and says:     No, we can do this under the Indian Gaming Regulation Act.     And Patchak then says:     Well, no, because you don't have valid authority under that Act because the Secretary shouldn't have taken the land into title. Now, that is not a quiet title action.     That is a nuisance action.     Can he have that adjudicated in that suit?       Right, right.       Right.     But there'd be no --       -- question of his ability to sue and put that question at issue.       Well, but that's a question that's not before us.       Thank you, counsel.       What specific -- do other consequences other than the ability of the Secretary to take land in trust flow from whether or not a tribe is recognized in 1934?       Mr. Miller, I mentioned earlier your footnote 1 in your reply brief about whether the time of filing question for sovereign immunity purposes is limited to diversity cases. Are there -- you cite one case.     Are there others going the other way?       What --       So this suit would come out the other way if the person objecting was just over the border in -- in Indiana, instead of in Michigan?     Because there would be -- it could be brought as a diversity suit.       I'm assuming --       Even if it were a suit against the tribe, it would still be not a diversity action but a Federal cause of action?
11-262 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 11-262, Reichle v. Howards. Mr. Gallagher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN R. GALLAGHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       I don't understand --       Thank you, counsel.       Mr. Srinivasan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS       I assume you would include U.S. marshals?       F.B.I. agents?     So, you're talking about protective details.
11-338 +++$+++        We will hear argument next in Case 11-338, Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center and Georgia-Pacific v. The Northwest Environmental Defense -- Defense Center. Mr. Bishop. ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Before -- before we get into that, congratulations to your clients -       -- getting almost all the relief they're looking for under -- under the new rule issued on Friday.       And thank you for calling it to our attention.       Well, but it's - it's an unusual situation for us to rule in a case -       -- where the issue has ongoing significance and that's taken away.     And what we would be doing is, when there is a new rule, we would be considering quite a lot of difficult issues to determine what the old rule was, so that you can unravel what the Ninth Circuit has upheld.       Is this a -- is this a new rule that they -- I too haven't had much of a chance to look at it.     But is this a new rule?     Or is it an amendment of the existing rule?       Are you sure you want what you're asking for?     What if we go ahead and decide this case and rule against you?       Now, I suppose that your clients and others similarly situated -- or I -- I guess it would be the Respondents -- can challenge the new rule, right?       So you would have, simultaneously pending, a case involving the interpretation of the old rule and a challenge to the new rule.       Each of which would have the same issue.       Are you -- which issue are you talking about?     The industrial activities issue or the silvicultural?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS       Were you as surprised, as we were, to learn about that final rule?       When did you learn that the final rule would be issued on Friday?       You had no idea before Friday that this was coming out?       In early November?       Maybe in the future, you could let us know when something as definite as that comes. There were 875 pages on the merits briefing in this case, and if we knew that the final rule was imminent, we could have rescheduled the case for April or-- or something along those lines.       Oh, I know, that there was a proposed rule.     Is it your experience that proposed EPA rules become final within a couple of months, particularly?       Well, maybe.     And it would have been best if we had known about this in early November.       Do you -- are you saying that the private companies would not be liable for civil penalties, even though the alleged violation was ongoing at the time of the district court litigation?       Well, can I stop you just for a moment?     EPA made clear that the conduct was not unlawful.     We have a new regulation.     The fact that they have issued a new regulation doesn't mean that the reading -- doesn't mean that that's a demonstration that the prior conduct under the old regulation was lawful. Now, I know you've taken the position that it was not, but you've got a court of appeals decision saying it was.       That -- that would have to be based on the assumption that the Ninth Circuit decision was wrong.       I -- I'm having trouble seeing how we can dismiss it as moot when there would remain pending claims for civil penalties and injunctive relief, which you've already said you want to take a closer look at, and attorneys' fees. Now, you seem fairly confident that they'll lose on those, but you felt pretty confident that you'd win on this.       Is this something that -- in terms of mootness, we should evaluate under the voluntary cessation doctrine?       The EPA has changed its ways.       Thank you, counsel. Mr.     Bishop, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
11-345 +++$+++        Well, I get to say that this is Case Number 11-345, Fisher against the University of Texas at Austin.     And you get to say -- ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERT W. REIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, I'm sorry. Now, I'm confused.     I thought the 15 percent figure was the one that was arrived at with the 10 percent plan.       We will afford you rebuttal time, since our questions have prevented you from reserving it.       Thank you, General. Mr. Rein, 10 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BERT W. REIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Just keeping the playing field level.
11-393 +++$+++        We will continue argument this morning in Case Number 11-393, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, and Case 11-400, Florida v. The Department of HHS. Mr. Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Well, but it would have -- it would have passed parts of the hollow shell. I mean, a lot of this is reauthorization of appropriations that have been reauthorized for the previous 5 or 10 years, and it was just more convenient for Congress to throw it in, in the middle of the 2700 pages than to do it separately.     I mean, can you really suggest -- I mean, they cite the Black Lung Benefits Act, and those have nothing to do with any of the things we're talking about.       I don't understand --       Well, but that doesn't --       Finish your certain point.       But the reality --       The reality of the passage -- I mean, this was a piece of legislation which, there was -- had to be a concerted effort to gather enough votes so that it could be passed.     And I suspect with a lot of these miscellaneous provisions that Justice Breyer was talking about, that was the price of a vote:     Put in the Indian health care provision and I will vote for the other 2700 pages.     Put in the black lung provision, and I'll go along with it. That's why all -- many of these provisions, I think, were put in, not because they were unobjectionable.     So, presumably, what Congress would have done is they wouldn't have been able to put together, cobble together the votes to get it through.
11-45 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-45, Elgin v. Department of the Treasury. Mr. Schwartz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY A. SCHWARTZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       I'm sorry, just to clarify:     No, they wouldn't say that?     Or -- I'm -- I lost this, which way your "no" was going.       But could I --       Could I please verify your answer to Justice Kennedy before you move on?       So, that is the rule --       That's the rule that you would apply across the board so long -- only in the case of a facial challenge do you get to go to the district court?     If it's an as-applied -- this law was unconstitutional as applied to me -- that's still before the MSPB?       But that's not your position, as I understood it, in your response to my earlier question.     You said that the -- it is all right to have as-applied constitutional challenges presented to the MSPB or not presented but then reviewed in the Federal Circuit.       Okay, but -- but within the statutory scheme, are you saying that a claim that this statute is, while not facially unconstitutional, unconstitutional as applied to me -- Where does that go?       I think it's probably mine.       Where does -- where does -- where does that claim go?       Yes, what type -- summer interns and FBI employees?       I don't -- I don't mean that facetiously.     I mean, what they're saying is that there's some level of de minimis personnel actions when you're talking about the vast Federal bureaucracy that we don't have to really give, you know, the whole panoply of rights.     And FBI agents, I assume, because it's the sensitive nature of what they deal with. So, I guess what I'm saying is, do you want us to focus on the millions of employees who would now be going to district court or do you want us to focus on the small number that have facial constitutional challenges?       Is it really a question of jurisdiction of the MSPB?       "Jurisdiction" is a word with many meanings.       Thank you, Mr. Feigin. Mr. Schwartz, you have 2 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY A. SCHWARTZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Thank you, counsel.
11-460 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 11-460, Los Angeles Flood Control District v. The Natural Resources Defense Council. Mr. Coates. ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, it seems to me that they present a very direct syllogism.     You have a permit that sets these monitoring stations where they are.     The monitoring stations show exceedances, you have violated your permit.     What -- what's wrong with that?       Right.     But I understand the argument to be that that's the problem that your permit imposes on you; in other words, that this is where the monitoring station is supposed to be. What is it monitoring, if not discharges from the MS4, for which you're responsible? The government suggests that there could be different rules about whether you have to show the allocation or if that's your responsibility.       Well, you don't -- you don't question that there was an actual discharge. The storm sewer system in Los Angeles hasn't been shut down, right?       So there are discharges, right?       You don't dispute that there was at least some small amount of pollutant, even below the -- the permit level, from your point sources, do you?       Well, I'm asking you whether -- I mean, isn't it -- doesn't common sense suggest -- you have asked in your permit for a limit on how much of a --       -- particular pollutant you can discharge.       You wouldn't do that, unless you expected to discharge some.       Well, why did you put the monitoring sources where they are, if that wasn't what was going to measure your compliance with the permit?       Well, the government says that that question -- you're saying, I understand, there are other discharges -- well, you're by far the dominant discharger, but I understand there are others, and they may contribute as well to what the monitoring station says. But the government's position is that, well, that's how you wrote the permit without any allocation; and that whatever allocation issues you have may be between you and the other dischargers, but that doesn't affect the showing of liability.       Where is that?     I know we've got the permit.     Where does it read that way?       So what -- what percentage of discharges come from you, as opposed to the other members of the MS4 --       Give me an estimate.       What -- what goes into these discharges, besides the rainwater runoff?       Okay.       So your -- your hypothesis is, in some of these minority dischargers, that, for some reason, their rainwater would have a different amount of pollutants than your rainwater?       Justice Kennedy.       Where --      where is that requirement?       Where is that requirement that you're now doing?       So you are not doing it now?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Coates, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, I understand, and you do cite a lot of cases for that, but I can't figure out what sense it makes.     I mean, if you're willing to give up Santa Clara and Malibu, you're -- you're safe there, and that's the only thing you've won. Why does it -- how does that make sense?
11-465 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-465, Johnson v. Williams. Ms. Brenan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANIE BRENAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       The -- the court of appeals, whose decision we're reviewing, understood the Respondent to present a separate State claim and a separate Federal claim, correct?       That's the predicate to the whole question we have before us, right?       Any idea based on your experience how many separate claims are typically raised in a capital case of this sort?       I'm sorry.       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Brenan, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANIE BRENAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11-551 +++$+++        We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-551, Salazar, Secretary of the Interior v. Ramah Navajo Chapter. Mr. Freeman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. FREEMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS      So the consequence on the ground is that, if I'm a tribe and I want this money, and I figure out that this is going to cost me $80,000 --      -- I sign a contract and say, this is going to cost me $100,000, because I know there isn't going to be $100,000.     There's only going to be $80,000, and that's what I need, right?      No, but it's -- well, if 80,000 is reasonable, the only way to get that is to ask for 100?       It makes sense if you're looking at the reality of the budgeting process because in one case, that line item appears on the Department of Interior budget; and in the other case, it appears somewhere else in the Judgment Fund budget.     And they can say it's not our fault.     The Judgment Fund -- the Court made us do it --       Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Freeman, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. FREEMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       I'm sorry.     I didn't think that was responsive.     Does the Secretary -- Justice Kagan can defend her own question -- but does the Secretary have the discretion to adopt something other than a pro rata distribution when there are not sufficient appropriations?
11-556 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 11-556, Vance v. Ball State University. Mr. Ortiz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Let's say you have a work room.     There are five people who work there.     And the employer has a rule that the senior employee gets to pick the music that's going to play all day long.     And the senior employee says to one of the other employees -- you know, if you don't date me -- I know you don't like country music; if you don't date me, it's going to be country music all day long. Now, that affects the daily activities of that other employee.     I would have thought, under your theory, that means that that senior employee is a supervisor.       Well, that could be -- that could be far more severe than, for example --       It could be far more severe than simply saying, all right -- you know, you're going to -- as in this case -- you're going to be cutting the celery rather than -- you know, baking the bread, or whatever.       Well, but, I mean, there are places where the environment -- you know, an assembly line or something like that -- where the task may not be that different, but how you -- the environment in which you have to perform them may be far more significant than whether or not you're attaching the door handles or the front fenders.       Well, exactly.     And I would have thought the benefit of the Seventh Circuit's test was that you don't have to go through those case-by-case basis.     I think we can have a reasonable debate about whether the music you have to listen to for eight hours is objectively a significant enough interference with the daily activities to qualify under your test. But the Seventh Circuit test makes clear -- it doesn't give any kind of immunity; it just makes clear what type of analysis is going to be applied to the allegation.       Mr. Ortiz, you have more minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       That's all in the record in this Court.       Just not in the Joint Appendix.
11-564 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-564, Florida v. Jardines. Mr. Garre. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, we've had a lot of -- we've had a lot of discussion about whether it's 5 minutes or 15 minutes or whether it's mothballs. I understood the issue before us to be whether or not under the Fourth Amendment it is a search for a dog to come up to the door and sniff, not with respect to -- we're not making a judgment, I thought, on the probable cause in light of the totality of the circumstances, but the ground of decision below was this is a search when the dog sniffs.       Thank you, counsel.       Ms. Saharsky. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY, FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       Could I follow up on Justice Breyer's question, because it strikes me as a little confusing.     Does the dog, as soon as he or she is at the door, sniff and sit or sniff and not sit, or does the dog -- I mean, you've talked about the sniff is immediate.     What -- what is the 5 to 10 minutes?       And the whole process is -- is what?       It doesn't take the 5 to 10 minutes to walk to the door.     So the officer walks to the door, the dog sniffs right away and then?       Where -- where in the -- where in the record do I find the few seconds point?       Thank you, counsel.       Mr. Garre, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, counsel.
11-5683 +++$+++        We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-5683, Dorsey v. United States, and 11-5721, Hill v. United States. Mr. Eberhardt. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN E. EBERHARDT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Of course, the statute itself says "express," right?     Talking about section 109.       So, we're pretty far removed from the language of the statute, I guess.       Oh, and I understand that.     But presumably -- we also have the proposition that Congress, when it enacts legislation, knows the law.     They would have known section 109 required an express statement if they wanted to apply the change retroactively.     So, why shouldn't we hold them to that standard?       Justice Scalia.       Are we just supposed to assume that Congress knows that?     I mean, if you had asked me how long is the usual time from conviction or -- I mean, arrest to conviction, I wouldn't know if it's closer to 90 days or 11 months.       Well, right.     But I mean -- and we assume Congress knows the law.     I don't know that we can readily assume they know details such as that and evaluate their -- what would your position be if the Congress said do this as soon as practical but, in any event, no later than 8 months from now? Would we then think there's a fair implication that Congress meant it to apply retroactively or not?       Thank you, counsel.       Mr. Dreeben. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS       So, why -- why days?     I mean, the Commission basically just took the ratio under the new Act and applied it, didn't they, throughout?     They took the mandatory minimum formula that had been changed and changed it throughout the - the sentencing provisions?       Certainly.       Mr. Eberhardt, you have 3 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN E. EBERHARDT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       All those arguments have nothing to do with the provision about the Sentencing Commission is supposed to act quickly or any of that, right? Your argument is what rational reason could Congress have had to -- given the urgency of the problem, the seriousness, why wouldn't they have wanted the provisions to apply as you urged they should?
11-597 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next this morning in Case No. 11-597, Arkansas Game & Fish Commission v. The United States. Mr. Goodhart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. GOODHART ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       No, no, no, I don't -- why is that every flood?     You go through your three factors, you could have lots of flood that aren't a substantial intrusion.     You know, you get an extra inch of water, and then it recedes.     And it's -- you know --       -- you get a note from the Corps of Engineers saying, we're sorry, it won't happen again.     That's not -- every flood is not --       Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Goodhart, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. GOODHART ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11-626 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 11-626, Lozman v. The City of Riviera Beach. Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, that just has -- I understand that argument.     It's got no connection whatever to the statutory language, right?       Capable is in the statute, purpose is not, right?       Before you get to Evansville, let's say it moved around, which is one thing, but also it had a raked bow; it wasn't square. Then -- then it starts to look more like a boat.     It moves around more frequently. Its mooring -- I mean, if you have a sailboat and you pull it up to a dock, you hook up for water and plug in for power.     It doesn't seem to me to be terribly significant.       Aren't you just begging the question?     You keep saying it was not a vessel to begin with.     Why -- doesn't it just restate the question?       Well, doesn't your argument beg the question?       So it changes -- one -- the same thing is not a boat sometimes, and it is a boat.     You've got a casino that's tied up for a month. During that time, it's not a boat.     And then they move it around to go to the other side of the river, and during that time it is a boat?       But -- but I'm just -- the hypothetical -- the hypothetical I've posed was meant to pose the question, well, sometimes things do both, and how do we tell which it is --       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       Can I -- can I interrupt you just there on the dredging?     You say the function of the dredge was to carry people and equipment.     I would have said the function of the -- the dredge is to dredge in the middle of the river.       Right?     And so -- and I don't know which of us would be right, so it seems to me that that function test is a very difficult one to apply.       Well, I know what it said.     I guess I would say, obviously, it serves a waterborne function, but I'm not sure the first thing I would say when I see one of these dredges in the middle of the river is its purpose is to move people and equipment.     I would say its purpose is to dredge.       No, I know but that's saying that it has to be able to move, and I agree with that.     But its purpose is still to dredge, not to move.       You could use it if you had a -- you know, a transportation boat, right? Any equipment you need to move, you put it on another boat and drop it off.     The people who work, you bring them over and drop it off.       Sure it is, isn't it?     I mean, the superscoop doesn't go to the -- maybe it does -- go to the shore every morning, then come right out again?     They move people back and forth with other boats, don't they?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher, you have 3 minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       That is -- what was used in the Higgins boats in World War II.
11-681 +++$+++    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-681, Harris v. Quinn. Mr. Messenger. ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. MESSENGER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   Are there any -- you suggest, in response to my colleague's guestion, that they could -- the State could pay healthcare providers different rates. Is there -- are there any limitations? We're talking about Medicaid reimbursement.   Are there any limitations that would prevent differential rates of pay, reimbursement, under Medicaid for the same services?   Jump in whenever you'd like. (Laughter.)   Please.
11-697 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 11-696 -- 697, Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons. Mr. Rosenkranz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, counsel.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rosenkranz, you have four minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11-702 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-702, Moncrieffe v. Holder. Mr. Goldstein. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       And that question's not before us today.       Okay.     Well, isn't the reason we don't look at the particular facts and particular case and don't depose four district attorneys, is that the Court has adopted a categorical approach precisely to avoid that type of inquiry in -- whatever it is, 750,000 cases?       No, no, I'm sorry. We don't need that because we've adopted a categorical approach.       841(b)(1)(D) lists the elements and conviction in -- Georgia, right?       Conviction in Georgia under their provision satisfies -- has each of those elements.     And under our categorical approach, that's the end of the inquiry.       They want to do that at the tail end, right?       Before you get on -- I didn't understand that to be their position at all.     I mean, I suppose we -- I certainly will ask them because they're probably better able to articulate their position, but --       Go ahead.       I'm sorry.     Could you remind me what the "it" is that you're talking about?       It's an order from the Attorney General --       -- to the immigration judges --       -- to?       I'm sorry.     Go ahead.       Your use of the statistics, I think, assumes that Georgia and other States are prosecuting every case that comes before them because that's how you get -- you know, of these 750,000 nationwide, so much more than must involve tiny amounts. But, of course, perhaps they don't prosecute the cases involving tiny amounts, so that most of those cases, or some percentage of them, may in fact also involve the serious type of conduct addressed by the Federal statute.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11-713 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next today in Case 11-713, Perry v. Perez, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS       You can finish your -- finish your answer, please, if you can.       Counsel, I think there -- I see two different problems, and I'm not quite sure how to come out.     One, you cannot assume that the legislature's plan should be treated as if it were precleared.     The district court in Texas cannot assume or presume what the district court here in D.C. is going to do. But, on the other hand, it can't presume it the other way.     In other words, it can't draw its interim plan assuming that there are going to be these section 5 violations because that's presuming what the court's going to do the other way. So, how do we decide between those two -- you have two wrong choices.     How do we end up?       I don't think we do, either.     Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS       Finish the sentence.
11-770 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 11-770, Chunon Bailey v. United States. Mr. Shanmugam. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       You said the difference is there's no immediate threat to the officers here.     But there is a threat, I suppose, I mean, if he finds out about the search and comes back, if he sees the officers outside his dwelling, if there's somebody in the dwelling who can notify him, send him a message that the police are searching and he can get his confederates and come back. It seems to me that you're requiring that there be a larger number of police present at the site conducting the search, being lookouts for anybody that might come back, being able to detain people who are leaving as they approach.     There's no immediate threat, but there's certainly a threat.       Well, it requires more unless they want the guy to get away, I guess, right?       We talked about -- we talked about officer safety.     What about the safety of others?     Suppose the place being searched is adjacent to a playground and there are, you know, dozens of children playing in the playground.     The police are worried there would be a shootout and they want to detain the person, so they say:     Well, let's wait until he gets a block down the street and detain him there for the safety of the kids.     That has -- they can't do that?       Yes, the precaution is let's wait until he's a block down the street because it will be a lot safer.     Can they do that and be covered by Summers or not?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shanmugam, you have 3 minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11-796 +++$+++        We will hear argument next this morning in case 11-796, Bowman v. Monsanto Company. Mr. Walters. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK P. WALTERS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Why in the world would anybody spend any money to try to improve the seed if as soon as they sold the first one anybody could grow more and have as many of those seeds as they want?       That's true, that's true in the case of any patented article, right?       So the patent system is based, I think, on a recognition that contractual protection is inadequate to encourage invention.       Well, you only need one -- I mean, you throw the seeds on the ground, one or two of them are going to grow and you still have the same case, right?       I'm sorry, maybe I didn't read this right.     I thought what he did was plant all the commodity seeds, and then applied the Roundup, so that all that was left was the Roundup resistance seeds, and then he used those.       How come that's not a problem the first time you plant?       No, no.     I mean the very first time, you get nothing but Monsanto Ready -- Roundup Ready seeds and you plant those.     Are you telling us you have the same problem with them growing at different rates and all that?       So that doesn't make the commodity seeds any different?       Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Mr. Walters, you have five minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK P. WALTERS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       What -- what about Mr. Waxman's suggestion that we've already decided this in Microsoft v. AT&T?       I'm sorry, I didn't follow that answer to Justice Scalia's question.
11-798 +++$+++        We will hear argument next in Case 11-798, American Trucking Associations v. City of Los Angeles. Mr. Lerman? ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL N. LERMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       That matters -- that matters in your view whether it's a key component of commerce or not.     If it's -- if it's a particular highway, a particular street, you think Castle doesn't Page 12 apply in that case?       Well, I think you have to get into it since I asked you a question about it. (Laughter.)       So they say there's this particular road, through a State park or something, Page 13 that's scenic, and sometimes the trucks drive on the side of the road and it causes damage to what the State's trying to preserve.     And they have a rule, look, if you do that three times and we warn you, the fourth time you can't use this road.     That is preempted?       There is another road not too far away.     You've got to use that one.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bash, welcome. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       Well, that's not true.     I mean, a commercial enterprise might want to attract customers because of its reputation as a -- as a green company because of its reputation of hiring local workers. I think you have too confined a notion of what -- what's good business.       Finish your answer.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lerman, you have 4 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL N. LERMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11-817 +++$+++        Mr. Garre, welcome back. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, counsel.       Mr. Palmore. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       And you agree that that's an appropriate area of inquiry?       The judge, presented with, here's Aldo, he was -- went to this school, he was certified, the judge can say, when was he last tested, right?     When did he last go through some --       The -- the only thing really you say they can't ask about is what's -- what's his record.       Do you -- I'm not sure it's relevant, but do dogs -- are their -- does their ability -- is it even across the board?     In other words, if you have a dog that's trained and good at sniffing out heroin, the same dog is going to be good at detecting a bomb, or is there some difference?       So you don't know whether -- in other words, are dogs good at sniffing things, or are they -- can they be good at bombs, but not good at meth?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garre, you have 3 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, counsel.
11-820 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-820, Roselva Chaidez v. United States. Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       It's a surprise to the, what, ten courts of appeals who came out the other way?       So maybe it was -- maybe it was a surprise to the members of this Court that disagreed with that --       -- with the ruling in Padilla.       I think you've been -- you've been asked this, and I'm not sure I got your answer.     Give me an example of something that -- like the consequences in Padilla that would not be covered by your argument?       If you had --       If you had that case, what would you rely on in arguing in favor of the habeas petition?       You would start with Strickland, and you would talk with -- Padilla, right?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher, you have two minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, counsel.
11-864 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-864, Comcast Corporation v. Behrend. Mr. Estrada. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL ESTRADA ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Estrada, you have five minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL ESTRADA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
11-88 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next in Case 11-88, Mohamad v. The Palestinian Authority. Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       We usually like --       We usually like to begin with the language of the statute.       Well, then go ahead. (Laughter.)       So, they did this to --       They chose that word to avoid any residual ambiguity.     But they thought there was no ambiguity at all as to whether the term "individual" meant natural persons or organizational entities?       But you have the -- you have the additional problem, though, that your reading gives a different meaning to "individual" in two sentences that are right -- actually it's in the same sentence:     an "individual" who does the torturing, subjects an "individual" to torture. Now, I understand your argument that you can Have an organization doing the -- the subject thing, but how do you subject an organization to torture?       You don't.       So, "individual" in the one clause you say means "organization"; "individual" in the other necessarily does not.       But Congress -- as you've indicated, Congress focused on the very question of whether organizations would be covered or not in the context of whether a state would be covered.     It seems to me that the legislative history cuts strongly against you, putting even aside Congressman Leach.     The issue was there.     And if they meant to say, well, let's find a term that leaves some types of organizations out, states, but not others, we'll just say "individual," and people will understand, oh, we don't mean a state, but they'll also know but we do mean another type of organization, a corporation.       So -- but it's at least ambiguous, and you're saying, well, we want a term that's going to include individual persons and organizations but not state organizations.     And the only term that fits perfectly is "individual."       Really? (Laughter.)       But you've been saying all along "individual" has a secondary meaning.       So, why would they have picked the secondary meaning of a word rather than try --       Well, the TVPA is an extraordinary step in terms of exposing liability, and it doesn't seem to me to be an odd idea that Congress would want to proceed carefully before establishing a situation where the use of the American tribunal is as broad as it is under this situation.       Thank you, Mr. Gannon. Mr. Fisher, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
11-889 +++$+++        We will hear argument next this morning in Case 11-889, Tarrant Regional Water District v. Herrmann. Mr. Rothfeld? ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       How does -- how does Oklahoma apply its law in this situation?     I assume there is normal priorities and they will get applications from a lot of people.     But they have to - what do they have to give Texas?     Up to 25 percent? I mean, they can't just say -- deny it because another Oklahoma user has priority, or all this. How does that fit in with the existing administrative structure?       But it's got to give Texas at least up to its 25 percent, right?       I guess what I'm asking is, does the Compact give Texas special priority apart from what Oklahoma -- Oklahoma's priorities would be?       Thank you, counsel. Ms. OConnell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN OCONNELL, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       Well, where, if you're relying on the Compact and its language, where do you come up with this idea that States first have to try to get their 25 percent from water within their borders? I don't see that anywhere.       Well, it seems to me that you like some provisions of State law, but not others.       What do you do - what do you do with a situation -- let's say there's Oklahoma water available to Tarrant that is closer than the water they would get from somewhere else in Texas. Do they have to incur the additional expense to get Texas water, or can they take the cheaper route and get Oklahoma water?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rothfeld, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
11-8976 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-8976, Smith v. United States. Mr. Kramer. ORAL ARGUMENT OF A.J. KRAMER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Mr. -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.     Finish your answer.       Well, your argument basically reduces to the fact that, when it comes to the statute of limitations, you treat the conspirators as individuals, rather than as members of the conspiracy.       Yes, well, that's not true with respect to other aspects of the conspiracy.     If members of the conspiracy commit a murder, and it was anticipated and all that, the person that has nothing to do with that, other than being a part of the conspiracy, is liable -- criminally liable for that as well.     Why is there a special rule for statutes of limitations?     Well, why is he treated as an individual, rather than a member of the conspiracy in that respect?       No, my point is that, once you prove the conspiracy, a member who doesn't -- that doesn't actually participate in the activities of the conspiracy, is still responsible for them.     So it makes sense to say you can prove the statute of limitations with respect to the conspiracy, not with respect to each individual.       Well, that's why it's very difficult to put the burden on the government, because the people -- he says, well, I told so-and-so I'm out of this business, I'm not going to do it anymore.     And so the government, if they had the burden of proof, would say, well, I don't think that's true, I want to call the person you -- you talked to. And the person says, well, I'm not going to testify because I take my rights under the Fifth Amendment.     There is no way the government -- in many cases, there would be no way the government can carry this burden of proof.       I'm -- I'm having trouble understanding how this works.     You said a while ago that the government has -- doesn't have to do anything?     In other words, he puts on -- he says, I withdrew.     And I told this -- the head of the conspiracy that I wanted no more part of it.     And the head of the conspiracy says, well, I'm not going to testify. And then the government doesn't have to do anything?       Well, how is that -- how is that carrying the burden that you say is on it to prove the absence of withdrawal beyond a reasonable doubt?     It seems to me that, if the government just sits there and doesn't say anything, they'll never be able to carry their burden.       Yes, but they've already done that.     That's --       No, no, no.     My hypothetical is, because we are talking about the criminal conspiracy, and the idea is did he tell those people he was out, they're probably going to say, I'm not going to testify. And so -- and you say, well, the government still doesn't have to do anything.     It seems to me that you can't say that they've carried their burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, if they have nothing to say about an issue as to which you say they have the burden of proof.       Believe what evidence?       But there can't be any evidence because nobody is willing to testify under -- because they invoked their Fifth Amendment rights.       Okay.     Well, if the defendant does testify, and he says, I told the ringleader I want out, is an attack on his credibility sufficient to prove the absence of withdrawal beyond a reasonable doubt?       Thank you, Ms. Harrington. Mr. Kramer, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF A.J. KRAMER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
11-9307 +++$+++        We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-9307, Henderson v. United States. Ms. Gilley. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. GILLEY APPOINTED BY THIS COURT       Well, this is a -- I mean, the time from the district court decision in this case to today is how long?       So it's 2 years -- in any case in which -- in a typical case in which this happens, you've got 2 years of cases, right?       Where in Johnson did they -- I'm looking at the para -- two paragraphs the Court spent on this in Johnson.     Where did they look at the text? I mean, obviously, they quoted the text, but the analysis seems to me to be based solely on judicial efficiency.       No.     I'm looking at where they talked about this particular question, the second prong, as they -- they put it.       He was the Chief Justice, by the way.       It matters to one of (Laughter.)
11-9335 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-9335, Alleyne v. United States. Ms. Maguire? ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY E. MAGUIRE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       That sounds like -- that sounds like an argument that it's wrong, and that is, of course, the first step in -- in the stare decisis analysis.     It doesn't sound, to me, responsive to Justice Kagan's question is, in what sense is it unworkable?       It started, "Mr. Chief Justice." (Laughter.)       That's -- I'm not sure that that's -- you've emphasized several times that it takes away the discretion of the judge.     That seems, to me, to be a matter between Congress and the Judiciary and not a Sixth Amendment question.       Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Ms. Maguire, you have five minutes remaining.

Well, even on a prospective basis, your brief talks about notice and fairness and predictability; but if California said, going forward, this is the rule that we're going to apply, is there any constitutional problem with that?

11-982 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first today in Case 11-982, Already, LLC, d/b/a YUMS v. Nike. Mr. Dabney. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       You get a lot of what this extra stuff -- you know, that you say, well, even if this is all right, they're not going to sue me for that, there's all the collateral damage.     You get a significant amount of that by the covenant not to sue. Nike can't go around giving out these covenants left and right because, if they do, they will undermine their own trademark.       Where does it -- where does it do that?       Okay.     So if you take -- if that were taken out, is your case the same or not?       Well, I guess maybe this is the same question Justice Ginsburg was asking. You're -- you're a lawyer in this area.     You want to write a covenant that will satisfy the fellow on the other side, but what does it say?     Can you do that?     Or do you have to say, the only way this case can be rendered moot is if the trademark is totally invalidated?       No, no, that's kind of a yes or no answer.     Can you write a covenant that says something other than the trademark is totally invalidated?       No.       So you're saying that, in this case, there's no way -- I mean, I thought it was a practice that was not unprecedented for parties to grant covenants of this sort.     You're saying this is unheard of, nobody -- nobody can do this?       Mr. Dabney --       -- if you had the - the various interests that you're asserting now -- we're not talking about mootness, but we're talking about Article III standing.       I'm looking at what you're alleging, that you have plans to introduce particular shoes.     People are considering investing in your company.     Your opponent has intimidated retailers. If you brought a suit by yourself, is that sufficient to establish Article III standings?     Are those the sort of concrete and tangible injuries that we've required?       Just because you plan to introduce a particular line of shoes, you can bring a lawsuit?       No.     Okay.     Just because people are considering investing -- somebody who came in and said, I've got this company, people are thinking of investing in it, and therefore, you want to proceed with your lawsuit?       Well, that surely would not establish Article III standings.     Everybody's cost of operation is increased whenever there's any trademark at all because you have to check and see whether it violates a trademark.       No, I suggested it might not.       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING VACATUR AND REMAND       I thought your answer to Justice Kennedy's question might be that the -- an adverse decision from the agency covering you is an additional injury in fact that gives you Article III standing, unless the -- unless the basis for the agency's decision is you don't have any injury.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dabney, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BOURKE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       How much money would be needed for investigation and experts before you would acknowledge that that would be competent representation?       Well, I mean, Justice Alito's problem seemed, to me, to get back to Justice Scalia's point, is that he seemed more interested in the funding than a speedy trial, the funding that would be provided by the State under its procedures.       And, as Justice Alito pointed out on several occasions, what the defense lawyer said was, let's put it off and see if we can get funding, let's put it off until there's the funding hearing, let's put it off and put it off, as opposed to saying, I want a speedy trial, I'm entitled to it now, if you don't have the money, I don't get a speedy trial, I get off scot-free.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bourke, you have about 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BOURKE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Go ahead.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Well, but I guess the problem is that there are a number of different ways you could carry out the program.     And let's say you have an organization that focuses on a particular -- you know, the administration of hospitals or whatever it is that's covered by the program, and they regard this issue as collateral to what they're concerned with. There -- there have to be some limitations on what type of loyalty oath you can require them to sign, isn't there?       Well, what if they --       I appreciate that. What if they're not?     What if the government has, in addition to this policy, a strong policy in promoting -- you know, recycling, and so they require everybody with whom they're going to do business, every grantee, to adopt a policy in favor of using renewable resources?     Any problem with that?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Mr. Srinivasan
12-1036 +++$+++       We'll hear argument next today in Case 12-1036, Mississippi v. AU Optronics Corporation. Mr. Massey. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. MASSEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER      What if you have an executor and he's administering an estate in which 100 people have equal shares to the estate, and the estate has a claim.    And he brings it on behalf of the estate. Now, is that covered as a mass action or not?      Then it would make -- it would make no sense for a defendant in a class action brought by consumers to ever settle the case. It's going to have to pay twice.    It's going to have to pay consumers, and then it's going to have to pay you because you can:    Say, well, we want restitution and we are not going to distribute it to the class members, but we're entitled to it.    And I assume the amount of the restitution is based on some estimate of the class, the consumers' claims.      Is there -- what is your understanding under Mississippi law, which you know a great deal more than I do, about any limits on a parens patriae action? Let's say there was one purchaser in Mississippi of LCDs, whatever, or two or three.    Could you bring a parens patriae action on their behalf?      Well, I know but I'm trying -      Unlikely as a practical matter or as a legal matter?      Did the State interest that's being -- the State interest that is being asserted is damage to the consumers?      Because it harmed members of the population of Mississippi, right?      Damage to -- having less money is a damage to the consumer.      What prevents - what prevents attorneys general from around the country sitting back and waiting until every -- as private class actions proceed, and as soon as one settles or the plaintiffs' class prevails, taking the same complaint, maybe even hiring the same lawyers, to go and say, well, now we are going to bring our parens patriae action.    We know how the trial is going to work out or we know what the settlement is going to look like, and we are going to get the same amount of money for the State?      Well, that's got not nothing to do with it, does it?      I'm sure it's a serious matter when a plaintiff class recovers for, as in this case, an antitrust violation or whatever. What's the answer?    I'm sorry, repeating my question.      So the answer is that there is nothing to prevent 50 attorneys general, 51, from saying, every time there is a successful class action as to which somebody in my State purchased one of the items, we are going to file a parens patriae action, the complaint is going to look an awful lot like the class action complaint, and we want our money?      I'm sorry, counsel, but you told me the State's own interest was in protecting its consumers, so it would be able to file this suit every time its consumers have been harmed as demonstrated either through settlement or suit.    That's the State interest, protecting its consumers.      But you can't provide any reason why they wouldn't do so, and presumably would start doing so with greater frequency if you prevail in this case.      It doesn't have to be the same case.    It can be the next case on the court's docket.    The first case is In Re:    LCD Litigation and the second case is State of Mississippi v. LCD Manufacturers.      And in every one of those cases, there had been private class litigation prior to the filing of parens patriae?      Thank you, Mr. Curran. Mr. Massey, you have four minutes remaining.

When you say the standard error of measuring, you're talking about a degree of confidence, right?   And your submission is that you need to have a 95 percent degree of confidence. That's what -- that's what the 5 gives you or do I have the numbers wrong?   I thought the standard --   Right.   I know. I'm just trying to figure out what it means.   Okay.   So why is 95 percent? Where does that come from?   -- under Atkins? Why -- why are you picking 95 percent? Why isn't it 90 percent?   Why did the other why did the -- the organizations pick 95 percent.

Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E.

Maybe --   Counsel, you began that discussion by saying putting Massachusetts v. EPA to one side. But I was in the dissent in that case, but we still can't do that.   Well, why don't you take an extra 5 minutes, and -- and you can begin by answering the guestion: You know, the Government disaggregates the discussion, and their first point in their brief is that greenhouse gases can be regulated with respect to sources that are already covered by the PSD program. That position does not implicate your concern about the broad reach of EPA regulation, does it?   I understand. But they would only be applying that with respect to sources that are already reguired to operate under PSD permits.   You have three and a half minutes left.   No. You will get 5 minutes of rebuttal.   Thank you, counsel. General Mitchell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN F. MITCHELL ON BEHALF OF STATE PETITIONERS   Thank you, General. Mr. Keisler, 5 minutes.

LECHNER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   The patent you talk about, I am not recalling it exactly. It had some -- it mentioned the railroad interest, right?   So it didn't characterize it as either an easement or a fee with an implied reverter?   But they are not really not alternative -- well, maybe it's all right to say they are alternative arguments, but they are mutually exclusive arguments. I mean they are alternative in the sense that they led to the same result, but the one argument is that this is A, and the other argument is this is not A.   Mr. Lechner, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. LECHNER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
12-1182 +++$+++    We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-1182, Environmental Protection Agency v. EME Homer City Generation and the consolidated case American Lung Association v. EME Homer City Generation. Mr. Stewart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   That's -- I was just going to say, that just is because of, in the latter case, because contribution happens to be used in both an affirmative and a negative sense. The guestion is, for example, whether somebody who fatally stabs somebody and someone who fatally shoots them have each significantly contributed to the bad result.   Or -- or not significantly contributed in -- in -- contributed in varying degrees.   Well, when you mention the fact that the States didn't address the good neighbor reguirement -- of course, you hadn't come up with their budgets that they had to meet at the time that they had to promulgate their SIPs. Now, at a different point in your brief, you emphasize how incredibly complicated it is for States to determine how much they must reduce their emissions to take care of the fact that they significantly contributed to downwind pollution. And yet, you would impose on those States the burden to issue the good neighbor program without knowing how much you expect them to -- to meet.   So -- so if you were working for one of the upwind States and you were facing this 3-year deadline and EPA had not told anyone how it intended to interpret the State's obligations under the good neighbor policy, what would you have told the State to do?   Right. So -- but the head of the State EPA comes to you and says, how much do we have to reduce our emissions to satisfy our reguirements? And you would tell them what?   Well, but that kind of glosses over the fact that, as you say elsewhere in your brief, this is a -- is your analogy, right -- a spaghetti matrix or something? And so there's no possible way for the State to know how much of a burden you expect them to address, and yet, you're saying, well, you've got to do it, and you've got to do it within 3 years, or we're going to take over the responsibility.   But could I address the first thing first? I'm not sure that's right. I think EPA has an easier job dealing with it as a group. They say, look, here are these States, here's what you have to do. But any individual State has no idea what its particular role is going to be in your group resolution.   Including -- including the overcontrol argument? Or would that have been done?   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
12-1184 +++$+++    We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-1184, Octane Fitness v. ICON Health and Fitness, Incorporated. Mr. Telscher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUDOLPH A. TELSCHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   We're deal -- we're dealing with a term that could be read in many different ways: exceptional. Right? Maybe that means 1 out of 100; maybe it means 10 out of 100. And why shouldn't we give some deference to the decision of the court that was set up to develop patent law in a uniform way? They have a much better idea than we do about the consequences of these fee awards in particular cases. And since we're just -- as Justice Kennedy pointed out -- dealing with adjectives -- you know, meritless, frivolous, exceptional -- why don't give some deference to their judgment?   Do you agree with the Solicitor General's test that fees are authorized when they are -- I'm quoting -- "necessary to prevent gross injustice"?   Well, now, I was surprised at that because I would have thought your friend on the other side would say that. I mean, gross injustice sounds like a very tiny portion of cases; lower than meritless. I mean it's -- injustice is bad too. It's doesn't mean you just loss, but there's something very unjust about it. Gross injustice, well, it's just some more adjectives, and it's the test -- I gather that's the test you adopt.   Well, but you've been up here for several minutes and you haven't even used those particular -- or that adjective, which is your test.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Martinez. 4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZ FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER   So where does gross injustice come from? I understood that to be your test. You say, Fees are authorized when necessary to prevent gross injustice to the defendant.   Again, you have your long laundry list that doesn't say anything about gross injustice.

12-1281 +++$+++    We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-1281, the National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning. General Verrilli? ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   You say -- you say that it would repudiate the constitutionality of appointments. You don't suggest that those -- the actions of those appointees would be invalid going back however far you want to go back, do you?   Well, let's just talk -- let's focus on that. What, instead of saying, "No business shall be conducted," the order said, "It is not anticipated that any business will be conducted." Does that suffice to eliminate that period as a recess?   Yeah. Well, it's difficult and harder, but it also suggests that you're just talking about a couple of magic words that the Senate can just change at the drop of a hat, so maybe the point is not that significant.   But the compromise they settled on in moving away from that is that the President will nominate and the Senate, if it so chooses, can confirm a nominee. You spoke of the intransigence of the Senate. Well, they have an absolute right not to confirm nominees that the President submits. And it seems to me, following up on Justice Kagan's point, you're latching on to the Recess Appointment Clause as a way to combat that intransigence, rather than to deal with the happenstance that the Senate is not in session when a vacancy becomes open.   Well, the Senate has -- the Congress and the Executive have come together to address those sorts of problems in a vast number of cases by providing that there can be an acting general counsel of the NLRB to deal with that situation.   Your -- it's your argument -- your friend on the other side says one flaw with your argument is that it makes the words "it may happen" or "happen during" superfluous, that the clause would mean exactly what you say it means if you took those words out. And your response -- the only one I could see on the reply -- your reply brief, page 13, is that those words were put in there to quote, "confine the President to filling vacancies that actually exist at the time of appointment." Now, is that -- do you really think that they put that language in there because they were afraid the President would fill appointments that don't exist?   Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli, 6 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   And you argue that the Senate sort of acquiesced in that and everybody's come together, but what would you expect a Senator to do?   You know, the President appoints somebody during a recess contrary to the Respondent's view, what's the Senator who objects to that supposed to do?   Well, you would object to that, wouldn't you!  that you're objecting here.   Well, then that's not something that is effective for the Senate to do if --    you think it's unconstitutional.   Well, that'll show them. The Senate says we don't agree with your recess appointment, and you say, well, that's too bad, the appointee is still in office.   Well, some of the Senators did Senator Byrd --    famously objected to the President's assertion of that power.   No, I just want to make sure I understand. Your idea is the Senator who objects should do what?   But suppose the Senator says, look, I object to that, I think it's unconstitutional, but I'm not going to -- what can I do? The only think you do is impeach the President, right, for violating the Constitution. And he says it's not worth it for the -- one of the officers on the NLRB -   Well, but you say that action would be totally ineffective?   Take a few more minutes. (Laughter.)   Briefly.

Tell me exactly what your position is on that.       Well, it seems to me -- I don't see how that concession is at all needed by the other side.     I mean, let's just say they have a trade association or something.     They -- they can all get together and say we want to prepare an antitrust expert report about what American Express is doing, and they do, and then presumably, one of them can use it in the arbitration.     Any problem with that?       Well, again, that doesn't seem too difficult.     You either have your trade association or you have a big meeting of all them and say we need to pay for this expert report and once we've got it -- you know, I'm going to represent each of you individually in individual arbitrations and I'm going to win the first one, and then the others are going to fall into place and they'll get a settlement from American Express that's going to be -- satisfy their concerns.       Okay.     And you have no problem with that.       I'm sorry, I'm sorry.     Just a follow-up one, briefly.

It is not the standard boilerplate so you could say when he interprets it, he's really making a decision about arbitrability.     And you can follow -- I mean, you may disagree with it, I may disagree with it -- but you understand the reasoning.     It says, no civil action be brought, all such disputes will go to arbitration, this is a class action, this is a civil action, so it must go to arbitration, and therefore, it's there. Now, you -- you may not agree with it, but it -- it at least purports to be an interpretation of the language rather than a general rule.       Thank you, Mr. Katz. Mr. Waxman, you have 2 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
12-1371 +++$+++    We will hear argument next this morning in Case 12-1371, United States v. Castleman. Ms. Sherry. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   I don't understand that point. Are you saying the first episode of domestic violence wouldn't qualify? You keep talking about a pattern of behavior. I assumed your argument would be the same if it is the very first incident of misdemeanor domestic violence.   Why are you talking about -- why are you talking about patterns of domestic violence?   I'm sorry, you cannot cause bodily injury without using physical force?   So if the victim is at the top of the stairwell and you go "boo," and he or she falls down and is injured, is that physical force?   So then it's not a limiting term at all. Anytime anything happens, you would say there is physical force involved.   So if I did the same thing to two different people and one is injured and the other isn't, I am using physical force one time but not the other time?   Where is the actual physical force being applied?   Okay. So if they bump against the wall and that injures somebody but doesn't injure another person, it's use of physical force in one case but not the other?   But only one was injured.   I'm sorry. I  I'm having trouble grasping the concept. If somebody is lying down and somebody goes behind them and says boo and they have a heart attack and die, is that physical force?   But it might not include scaring the person and the person having a heart attack.   But doesn't that assume the conclusion of the case?   Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld. Ms. Sherry, 5 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
12-138 +++$+++    We will hear argument next in Case 12-138, BG Group v. The Republic of Argentina. Mr. Goldstein. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   Well, that's not true. There are numerous statutory regimes where Congress has decided, for example, it's valuable to give people a period of time to negotiate or discuss before you can go into -- into court. I mean, the EEOC and other sorts of things saying, let's everybody -- you know, step back, you have to negotiate for six months or you can't sue for another eight months. And a lot of times, nobody think that's going to change anything, but you can understand Argentina or any other country saying, look, before we're going to arbitrate -- you know, try our courts, you may find -- you may be surprised, right?   Well, that's -- it seems to me that this is a difficulty for you, the structure of the treaty. I mean, if you just end it after one, nobody would say, oh, well they must be contemplating arbitration or arbitration is in the background. They say, look, you have got a dispute, if you don't resolve it, you bring it in court.   Nothing about arbitration even in the background. Then they say, if you want to go to arbitration, you can. So, when you look at just the structure, it seems to suggest that Article I -- 8(1) is not part of the arbitration provision. It stands there and says, this is what you do, and then the arbitration kicks in later.   Well, that  your argument would be better there if this was Article 8 -- you know, arbitration of disputes or -- you know, parties can arbitrate, but, first, they must do this. No, it just -- you know, says settlement of disputes. The first thing is you can go to court here. The second thing is, if you want to arbitrate, you do this.   If you want to accept the invitation to arbitrate that is in 8(11) . If you don't, if you go to 8(1), which doesn't say anything, then, presumably, the decision of the tribunal will be binding.   Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING VACATUR AND REMAND   Briefly.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein, five minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   I'm not so sure you don't have to do anything, you just submit the paper. It says you have to submit it to the decision of the competent tribunal. And if the submission requires, okay, now, you have to file your brief, and you say, I'm not going to, I'm not sure that you've submitted it to a tribunal for its decision.   That seems that you're not totally circular in begging the question. I don't know that a sovereign would be anxious to submit its sovereignty to three international law experts.
12-1408 +++$+++    We will hear argument next in Case 12-1408, United States v. Quality Stores. Mr. Feigin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   Why -- I might have missed a step here. Why were they getting big tax bills if they're not wages?   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin, 18 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   Well, I think part of the -- the point is that the broad, capacious definition of "wages" at least doesn't seem as broad to the IRS since they are carving things out, maybe not willy-nilly, but at least they don't seem that it's as broad as you do -- they don't seem to think that it's as broad as you do.
12-142 +++$+++        We will hear argument next in Case 12-142, Mutual Pharmaceutical Company v. Bartlett. Mr. Lefkowitz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       One of our cases --       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang? ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       Well, but it's a little different.     Our cases are focused on the concern that the State is going to impose on the manufacturer a different duty than the Federal government. That's not what's going on in a strict liability regime.     They're saying, we're not saying you should have a different structure, we're not saying anything about warning, we're saying if you do this, you're going to have to pay for the damage.     It's not -- it's not a different duty.     And I think that's what's underlying the argument that, well, you can just stop selling because you don't have to adjust how you're going to make the drug.     You understand that it's going to be the same as the Federal drug, but our system is, you pay for the damage.       But is that meeting a standard under State law that your friend's argument says, that's not what we're talking about here.     The standard is the same.     It's just a question under strict liability that if you follow the same Federal standard and market this in our State, you're going to pay the compensation for the reason of -- you know, spreading the costs. We don't want you to do something different. We just want to say that you want to do the same thing as the Federal government, and then you're going to have to pay.     It's different than the -- at least that's how I understand their argument, which is that it's different where the situation says, yes, you can market it and avoid payment, but only if you do it our way. That's a different duty for the manufacturer.       Briefly.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lefkowitz, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
12-144 +++$+++        We'll hear argument this morning in Case 12-144, Hollingsworth v. Perry. Mr. Cooper? ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES J. COOPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Mr. Cooper, we have jurisdictional and merits issues here.     Maybe it'd be best if you could begin with the standing issue.       Well, that would be -- I'm sorry, are you finished?       Okay.     That -- that may be true in terms of who they want to represent, but -- but a State can't authorize anyone to proceed in Federal court because that would leave the definition under Article III of the Federal Constitution as to who can bring -- who has standing to bring claims up to each State.     And I don't think we've ever allowed anything like that.       Counsel, if you want to proceed to the merits, you should feel free to do so.       Mr. Cooper, we will afford you more time.     You shouldn't worry about losing your rebuttal time, but please continue on.       I'm sorry, maybe you can finish your answer to Justice Kagan.       Thank you, Mr. Cooper.       Thank you, General. Mr. Cooper, to keep things fair, I think you have 10 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES J. COOPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12-17 +++$+++       We'll hear argument this morning first in Case 12-17, MCBurney v. Young. Mr. Gupta? ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       All -- all he has to do is get somebody from -- from Virginia to ask for him, right?      Well, but you don't have to pay the person too much, he just has to write a letter saying, give me these documents, right?      Well, an increased cost of -- I don't know how much -- 100 bucks, right? Go -- write a letter, say you want these documents, and, when they come to your house, give them to me.       But this -- this is not -- this is not a regulation of commerce.    It's a State practice that may have an incidental effect on commerce, and the incidental effect may be disproportionate, depending upon whether you're State or local, but it's not a regulation of commerce.      What if the State of Virginia says, as a policy, we want to help Virginia businesses, and so we're going to open a business training, best practices institute, where you're going to learn how to be a better business person, but the only people who can come in are -- are Virginia businesses.       Under your theory, because that will have an effect -- an incidental effect    on commerce in a way that's discriminatory, is -- is that unconstitutional?      Is that -- when you're talking about impact, is that a Pike analysis?       Well, I thought, if it was facial discrimination, you're not concerned about impact.      I thought a question of talking about the effects on interstate commerce, that's the -- you know, the Pike analysis.       Is this -- is this your Privileges and Immunities argument or your dormant Commerce Clause argument?      So then it's not enough that this is a big deal to your client.    It has to be something that is essential to hold the country together as a national unit.     And it seems, to me, it's a bit of a stretch to say somebody gathering records about commercial -- under FOIA fits that description.      No, but, see, they're just to get into those.    Again, I think a lot of those examples you -- you do have access under other statutes.    You're talking about mortgage rules and all that.    Aren't those all -       Thank you, General. Mr. Gupta, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
12-207 +++$+++        We will hear argument next this morning in Case 12-207, Maryland v. King. Ms. Winfree? ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE WINFREE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Your -- your procedure limits the collection to certain violent offenses, right?       But your argument would not be so limited, would it?     Under your theory, there's no reason you couldn't undertake this procedure with respect to anybody pulled over for a traffic violation?       Well, I understand. But there's no reason you couldn't, right?     I gather it's not that hard.     Police officers who give Breathalyzer tests, they can also take a Q-tip or whatever and get a DNA sample, right?       Well, how long does it take to -- to undergo the procedure?     You know, you say, ah, and then -- you know.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben? ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DREEBEN, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       Yes, but that doesn't mean, for example, that you can go into their house without a warrant.       Well, that -- this is a factual question.     I understand your emphasis on the fact that it only looks at 26 loci, and they are supposedly not connected in any way with other information. Does the sample that you retain, can it be evaluated more broadly?     In other words, saying, well, the law says we only look at these 13, but we have this saliva, we want to look at all sorts of other stuff.       That argument only makes sense if we're in your -- your future world where it's 90 minutes, right?       It depends on -- if we have a situation such as Maryland says, 11 to 17 days, the footnote, whatever, the amicus brief says something else, but you are not going to put off the bail hearing for 2 weeks?       According to Samson and Knights, you're dealing with people who are still subject to the -- a criminal sentence.       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Winfree, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE WINFREE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       How can I base a decision today on what you tell me is going to happen in 2 years?     You say, in 2 years, we will have this rapid DNA available, but we don't now. Don't I have to base a decision on what we have today?

HORWICH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       I just want to make sure I heard you right.     You said if it sounds jurisdictional, we should say it is, and you win.       But your conclusion is that it is not jurisdictional.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Horwich, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

So let's say he's answering the questions. All of a sudden, he gets a particular question, and he says, you know, it's getting late, I think I'm done, and going to go home.     Is that an invocation of the Fifth Amendment right?       Well, is that something -       Is that something that could be used against him at trial?       Well, it's probative if that he says that -- he's answering all the questions, they're fine.     All of a sudden, they say, well, is your shotgun going to match the shell?       Then he goes, gosh, it's late, I'm going to go home.     That seems as - (Laughter.)       That seems as probative as the silence.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

GUERRA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       It's kind of hard to argue, when you have (b)s (1) through (14), that (b)(12) is the core provision.     Usually, it's -- it's 1 of 14 items in a list.       How -- how is somebody conducting an investigation in anticipation of litigation -- it hasn't started yet -- acting as an officer of the court?       Well, that just seems to me to be saying a lawyer is always acting as an officer of the court.       When you're preparing a discovery request, when you're -- anything -- anything that the officer functions --       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Guerra, you have four minutes remaining.

Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS      Well, even though it delegated rulemaking authority to a different agency, right?      And the SEC has no rulemaking authority that would cover this provision?      As I understand the ARB's decisions, they said that they were bound by OSHA's interpretation, right?      And OSHA made it quite clear in its interpretation that it -- and its rule that it had no authority to issue statutory interpretations.      So we should ignore the part where it said it's bound by OSHA's interpretation?      Go ahead.      Thank you, counsel. Mr. Schnapper, you have five minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS      But we know they don't have rulemaking authority in this area.
12-307 +++$+++        We will hear argument this morning in Case 12-307, United States v. Windsor, and we will begin with the jurisdictional discussion. Ms. Jackson? ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICKI C. JACKSON ON BEHALF OF THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE       Well, I would have thought --       I would have thought your answer would be that the Executive's obligation to execute the law includes the obligation to execute the law consistent with the Constitution.     And if he has made a determination that executing the law by enforcing the terms is unconstitutional, I don't see why he doesn't have the courage of his convictions and execute not only the statute, but do it consistent with his view of the Constitution, rather than saying, oh, we'll wait till the Supreme Court tells us we have no choice.       You can finish your sentence.       Thank you, counsel. That was more than a sentence.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement? ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT BIPARTISAN LEGAL ADVISORY GROUP OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES       What if you -- what if you disagree with -- the executive is defending one of your laws, if that's the way you insist on viewing it, and you don't like their arguments, you say, they are not making the best argument.    Is that a situation in which you have standing to intervene to defend the law in a different way than the executive is?       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Jackson, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF VICKI C. JACKSON ON BEHALF OF THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE       Sure.       Ms. Jackson, before you sit down, I would like to note that you briefed and argued this case as amicus curiae at the invitation of the Court, and you have ably discharged the responsibility, for which you have the gratitude of the Court.       I meant that we would take a break, not that -- we will continue argument in the case on the merits. Mr. Clement? ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT BIPARTISAN LEGAL ADVISORY GROUP OF THE UNITED STATES       Thank you, Ms. Kaplan. Mr. Clement, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D.

12-315 +++$+++    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-315, Air Wisconsin Airlines v. Hoeper. Mr. Cohn. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN F. COHN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   Material to -- to what?   I mean, you can have a defamatory statement about a pilot that's not material to -- you know, air safety. Is that what materiality goes to, the particular reason that the statement is made?   So you're saying you can't defame -- someone gets immunity for a statement that would be defamatory in the common law context if made generally, but because it's made in the context of information about flight safety, that's somehow immune?   So you call some TSA official and say this pilot -- you know, is having an affair. That's immune?   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER   Of course, you don't -- there's no reason -- and, presumably, a good trial judge wouldn't instruct the jury on those two separate guestions using the same word, right? I mean, you could articulate what you mean by "material" in -- in each context. In other words, you don't have to say it would be material to TSA. It would say just, as my colleague has suggested, whether or not TSA would have done anything different if a different formulation had been used.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cohn, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN F. COHN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
12-357 +++$+++        We'll hear argument this morning first in Case 12-357, Sekhar v. United States. Mr. Clement? ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Why isn't that - you focused on transferability when you began.     Why isn't that completely transferable?     I have leverage against this official and if you want him to recommend yes on your investment, you have to pay me a certain amount of money.     And you can transfer that.     You've got everybody in, say, you know, the association or whatever and you can auction that off.     It seems to me it's perfectly transferable from the defendant to anyone else.       Well, but the lawyer's going to make recommendations in many other cases as well.     And if you have an application coming up and you want a favorable recommendation, you can go to the -- the individual that has the leverage and say, I will pay you this much money if you can get the person to give me a favorable recommendation.     And that's transferable from the person with the -- the leverage to -- to someone else.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement, 5 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D.

So isn't that -- why isn't that a way to, in effect, have patent protection for the product?     Does somebody who wants to use the product, the DNA -- extracted DNA in this case, have to find a new process from -- to extract it if they want to have it available?       Oh, no -- yes, I know.     I'm assuming it isn't, that they discover this process and it leads to a -- a particular product.     Does anybody who wants to use the product either have to get a license for the process or find a different way of extracting it?       Thank you, counsel.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hansen, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. HANSEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Why don't you take another minute.

Is it your position that the preference is absolute or is it simply a factor to be considered with the other -- in other words, if every other factor suggests that the best interests of the child are served by placement with the adoptive couple, does the preference under 1915(a) trump all those other interests?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement? ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT GUARDIAN AD LITEM IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS       Finish the answer.       Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN OCONNELL, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       Well, you need to give us some examples of things that don't count.     I thought it was in your brief that you had said, look, the fact that it turns out to have been a very bad deal -- you know, the bargain was one year, and the sentence after guilty was 20 years, that, I take it, you say is not a corroborating factor.       Right.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bursch, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
12-416 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 12-416, the Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis. Mr. Stewart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, I thought Mr. Weinberger's point was that this is always going to happen because it's very easy -- as he said, you put a sign on your neck saying, generics line up to get your payment.     That seems quite different than saying there's another firm out there in the abstract that -- that might want to enter into a similar market sharing arrangement.     This is a very different system.
12-417 +++$+++       Our second case is Case 12-417, Sandifer v. United States Steel. Mr. Schnapper? ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS      Counsel -      We began with the assumption that the unions are on your side.    Is the United Steelworkers of America on your side?      Well, it does seem to support to notion that this is something that should be left to the collective bargaining process.      No, the point would be that the steelworkers gave up something when -- you know, it's part of a bargain.    Okay?    If they say, all right, we're not going to count this time, but, you know, you've got to give us ten more cents an hour or, you know, greater cafeteria facilities or something. It's a normal part of the bargaining process.    And it seems to me that if they're willing to give it up to get something else, what's -- what's the benefit to them of saying you can't do that?      Counsel, the whole approach here -- you are saying you are not going to give us a test, you are just going to criticize -      -- their test.      What about heavy duty pants, you know, blue jeans that somebody -- the thick ones that you use because the work environment will involve, you know, grease and hot things and all, but that you wouldn't necessarily or a particular worker wouldn't wear off the steel mill site?    Is that clothing designed to protect against work hazards or is it - some people would wear that outside the steel plant, other people wouldn't.      Yes, yes, but there are heavier-duty blue jeans that are made out of a particular fabric that you would see commonly in the steel mill, but you maybe wouldn't see commonly outside.

12-418 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-418, United States v. Kebodeaux. Mr. Dreeben. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, in Comstock, it was very different than the situation here because the analysis was that the Federal government basically was the source of the problem in incarcerating sex offenders away from the State so that no State felt an obligation to do something with the problem of their release. You don't have anything of that sort here.       So your argument depends in no way on the fact that he was convicted of a Federal offense or -- or incarcerated for that offense, nothing at all?     We're just here arguing about the retroactivity under -- whether they have the authority under Article I to impose punishment for not registering under State law?       Yeah, but if they can do that.     But that's not what they've done here.     Your argument, as you told me a while ago, is linked to the Federal offense and the incarceration.       Its because the States were not doing anything about it.       Here you have a situation where I think at the time every State dealt with the issue of whether the sex offenders should have to register or not.       Your argument based -- your argument based on Congress's authority with respect to the military, your Article I argument, and you say it doesn't make a difference that he's no Page 19 longer in the military, does that -- do you come out differently if the basis for jurisdiction is asserted to be inter -- interstate commerce?       The fact that somebody at some time in their life traveled across State lines means that the Federal government can go back, even though their activity that's challenged in the particular instance is only intrastate, and still assert jurisdiction over them?       I'm getting confused between two different assertions of a Federal interest. Earlier you talked about the integrity of the military forces.     They go back later, they think they should address the fact that people were engaging in criminal activities when in the military, they weren't -- they weren't found out, they weren't prosecuted.     Later on they can go back. Page 22 But then you say that the interest that's at issue here is preventing recidivism, and that doesn't seem to have anything to do with the integrity of the military force.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       And that's not Page 53 limited.     You've limited it to sex offenses, but the -- Congress could say it's important to us that people who serve in the military behave correctly even after they're released. So it is a Federal offense to do anything that violates State law for the rest of their lives, and your argument would say, well, that's part of their authority to regulate the military and so it's okay.       So your answer to my question is yes, Congress can do that.     It can say anyone in the military is subject for the rest of their life to Federal jurisdiction.     Whatever is a State law crime is a Federal crime.       Sure.

12-462 +++$+++    We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-462, Northwest, Incorporated v. Rabbi Ginsberg. Mr. Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   Counsel, could you tell me where you think they concede that some States -- that their position would lead to a different result in some States?   I thought they were saying that, in some States, it's not an implied term of the contract, but a different sort of provision.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yelin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS S. YELIN, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS   What if you had a decision by the Minnesota supreme court on common law contract principles and it said -- you know, when the parties use the word "sole" in a contract, we interpret that to mean subject to reasonableness constraint. The parties here use the word "sole." Would the application of that principle violate -- would that be preempted or not?   Well, "reasonable" means -- I mean -- you know, the -- the airline says "sole" means sole. We don't have to explain why we did it. And the Minnesota court said, no, when you say "sole," it has to be reasonable. It can't be, for example, for no reason. It has to be for some articulated reason.   Well, let's say going forward. Going forward, the parties know that this decision is out there, and they say, "sole." So it means they're using the term, subject to the gloss that's been put on it by the Minnesota supreme court. So what about in that case?   We would assume, then, that the parties knew, whenever they used the word "sole," they actually meant subject to reasonableness as interpreted -- interpreted by the Minnesota supreme court.   So you're not going to give me "reasonable" for anything?   Okay.   Well, if you're going to give me "reasonable" -- in other words, the parties' express terms do not say "reasonable"; in fact, the most natural reading is that it's not reasonable, but they take the contractual -- the interpretation that the Minnesota supreme court has adopted, I don't know why the same rule wouldn't apply when the Minnesota supreme court says there is an implied condition of reasonableness across -- across the board and that the parties contract against that background, just like they do when there's a specific interpretation of the word "sole."   I do agree, it seems pretty inconsistent with the normal presumption against preemption that we apply out of respect for the State legal regimes, to say we're going to adopt a broad prophylactic rule.   You -- go ahead.   Thank you.   Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Clement. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD SREBNICK ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       I thought your answer might have been that, yes, in fact, the property is entitled to greater protection because it's going to be used to hire counsel that will keep the person out of jail long term, even if he can be put in jail pending the trial.       And I suppose, if the government knows it's got to go through a hearing where it has to lay out part of its case, it may well decide at that point it's not worth it, so it's not 24 or 25.     Who knows how many hundreds of times the government would have sought to seize the assets, but didn't because they knew they would have to justify it at a hearing.       Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Srebnick, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD SREBNICK ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Counsel, I think your quotation from the D.C. Circuit was -- was not quite on point.     My understanding is the court was asking for empirical evidence that this has caused a particular problem, not whether they could point to any concerns.     I think we've seen the concerns laid out today.

Because everybody's paid off. He doesn't have any debts.   I should know this, but who's going to get stuck with the extra couple hundred thousand dollars?

Is your claim against your landlord preempted?       How does -- so if your tow truck is involved in an accident, is that -- and a suit is filed for negligence.     Is that preempted?       I'm just looking at the statutory language.     It says -- you know, "related to a service of a motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property," and you know, your motor -- your truck is involved in transporting property.     That's the claim against you, that you don't -- you don't render good service because you're negligent in a -- and it just seems to me to fit within the terms of the Page 19 statute, if you adopt as broad a reading as you adopt.

The effect of the aggregate limits is to limit someone's contribution of the maximum amount to about nine candidates, right?       Is there -- is there a way to eliminate that aspect while retaining some of the aggregate limits?     In other words, is that a necessary consequence of any way you have aggregate limits?     Or are there alternative ways of enforcing the aggregate limitation that don't have that consequence?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Burchfield. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BOBBY R.

But he did challenge my premise when I presented that to him.       So I do think he disagrees with it.

12-562 +++$+++        We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-562, United States v. Woods. Mr. Stewart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       What Judge Sentelle said in his opinion for the D.C. Circuit is that based -- agreeing with everything you've said, that means that the misstatement of basis might be obvious on an individual partner's returns.     What's wrong with it might be obvious, but it still is made on those returns, and therefore, that doesn't fall as a partnership item.       Mr. Stewart, if I could focus at a somewhat higher level of abstraction. I understand the general underlying thrust of your friend's position to be that overstatement of basis goes to -- you know, miscalculations.     It was actually $20,000, you say it's $40,000, and that's where the penalty comes from. Well, this case is quite different.     We are kind of wiping out the whole transaction, and then you're kind of artificially saying, well, if you wipe out the whole thing, when you come to basis it should be this and that.     And -- and it's not sort of a fraud or misstatement with respect to the basis itself.     It follows from a broad sham determination, and that sham determination is made at the partnership level, not the partner level.       I understand that, but if you were telling people what happened here - maybe you would -- I don't know that your first statement would be, they overstated their basis.     I think you would say, they engaged in a completely sham transaction, which had -- which had some obvious, as the D.C. Circuit put it, some obvious consequences.     But still, the -- the driving determination was that it was a sham transaction.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart, you have five minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Perhaps -       What do you do with your friend's hypothetical?     On the tax returns, you say, I gave a painting to a charity worth a million dollars.     In fact, he did not. And he says, what you are doing is you are going to go in and say, That wasn't worth a million dollars; it was worth nothing, when, in fact, what you should be saying is, You didn't give the painting at all.       Well -- but if you determine that the partnerships were shams, that's like saying that there were no partnerships.       And if you say -- you know, I didn't really give the painting, that means that there wasn't any painting.     It seems to me they're pretty closely parallel.       Do you -- do you agree that the new legislation completely resolves this problem?

Isn't Calder against Jones in considerable tension with your proposition that you don't look to the plaintiff's contacts with the forum?      I don't understand. Are you suggesting if this -- everything was the same except Ms. Jones was in New York, there'd be a different result in that case?

SAHARSKY, FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER       Even if -- even if the defendant does not submit an expert of his own, but simply puts his mental state in issue?       Why would it only be for -- why would it only be for impeachment purposes? It's directed at some statements that he said, which are not going -- not terribly pertinent to the mental diagnosis, but valuable evidence, and the defendant takes the stand; can the government call -- here's this person, he happens to be the doctor that took the -- the examination, but he learned some things here that we think are helpful.       Counsel, your time has expired.       Thank you, Mr. Katyal. General Schmidt, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEREK SCHMIDT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       What if -- what happens if the defendant is going through this examination, they ask him this, he tells them this, that, and all of a sudden, they ask him a question, he said, I'd rather not answer that.     I mean, is he allowed -- allowed to do that?       Why?     Because it might incriminate me?       That's a little bit different.     I understand terminate, then they'd say, well, look, you don't get to put your expert in.     But what if it's just -- you know, particular questions? What happens then?       Don't forget it. Why don't you try a quick response? (Laughter.)
12-62 +++$+++        We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-62, Peugh v. United States. Mr. Kinnaird? ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       What if you have a law that sentencing judges must consider these factors, and one of the factors is whether the defendant has strong family ties that will be -- you know, jeopardized or whatever, if he's incarcerated.     You don't want to take him away from his family because that will penalize other people.     And then Congress thinks that's not a good idea and they take that away. Is that an ex post facto violation?     It increases the factors of -- or the risk that the defendant will get a higher sentence.     Before, he could take advantage of the fact that he had -- you know, a particular family situation; later, he could not. That's a change in what the sentencing court must consider and is to his prejudice.       Well, under -- under our modification of the guidelines approach, isn't that just a list of factors that the Court should consider -- or must consider?       So what if the -- what if the law said the court must begin with a comparison of what the average sentence is across the country, okay?     And the data collection, over time, becomes more sophisticated, and they can give you a more accurate number for what the average sentence is.     And it turns out it's higher than what their informal survey was before. Is that an ex post facto violation?       No, no.     It'd be the same -- it'd be the same thing.     One of the things that the Sentencing Commission considers is, of course, what the average sentences were around the country.     And let's say that the law says that's something you have to consider, and the technology or the range of -- of judges that they can survey becomes more sophisticated, the number goes up.       Yes.       And so the answer --       And so the answer to my question is?       Just -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.       So just getting more accurate information violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, in the framework that you've set forth?       I'm sorry, who prevails?

HUNGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER      Would it make a difference in your analysis if instead of, as I understand the hypothetical, there was a point of saying, all rise or something of that sort?    Would it make a difference if the hypothetical Justice Kagan posed were the same except people weren't told to rise or invited to rise or, in fact, were told to stay seated, something like that, so there would be no indication of who was participating in the prayer?    Is that a -- is that a ground of distinction that you're willing to accept or not?      I wonder how far you can carry the -- your historical argument and whether some of these things are properly regarded as more historical artifacts, right?    I mean, our motto is "In God we trust," right?    That's the motto.    It's been that for a long time, right?      But wouldn't we look at it differently if there were -- suddenly if there were a proposal today for the first time, to say let's adopt a motto "In God we trust"?    Would we view that the same way simply because it's -- in other words, the history doesn't make it clear that a particular practice is okay going on in the future.    It means, well, this is what they've done -- they have done, so we're not going to go back and revisit it.    Just like we're not going to go back and take the cross out of every city seal that's been there since, you know, 1800.

12-7822 +++$+++       We'll hear argument next today in Case 12-7822, Fernandez v. California. Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER      But Randolph, I forget exactly how many times, but repeatedly said it was discussing a case involving the physical presence. And it had to do that because it was drawing a very formalistic line. If the other person had been in the back room instead of at the door or if the other person had been away for a minute, Randolph by its terms would not apply, because it said physical presence.    So it's not even extending Randolph to its logical conclusions.    It specifically said, we are not reaching anything beyond physical presence.      What about what we said in King just last year or the year before -- it's a quote:    "There are many entirely proper reasons why police may not want to seek a search warrant as soon as the bare minimum of evidence needed to establish probable cause is acquired.    The police may want to ask an occupant of the premises for consent to search because doing so is simpler, faster, and less burdensome than applying for a warrant." That seems to me to entirely refute the idea that oh, well, what they should do is get a warrant.      Well, what's the conversation between the husband and the battered wife, bleeding, holding the four-year-old baby going to look like?    Presumably, it has to take place away from the police because it's -- you know, it's a private conversation.    So the spouse abuser says to the police just give me a few minutes.    Let me talk to my wife. And that conversation is going to lead to some accommodation that you'd be prepared to honor?      Well, I quoted you the lang -- I quoted you the language from King from last year where we said that's not an adequate answer.      It's not purely an -- there's -- the language I quoted said any number of reasons.    One reason may be if the police leave and the woman is there -- we're dealing with gang violence - that other members of the gang may come and say, you know, retrieve the contraband in the house.    Going to get a warrant is not a sufficient answer in -- in every case.    There are -- there's a reason that the law has recognized the efficacy of consent in allowing the police to enter.      Well, you don't think there would be exigent circumstances in the case of -- this case, do you?      Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher, you have six minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER      Counsel, I don't understand how you can say it would render Randolph a dead letter.    The -- Randolph was expressly limited to physical presence.    It expressly acknowledged that it was formalistic, and even the concurring opinion said, quote, "The Court's opinion does not apply where the objector is not present and objecting." So what you're really arguing for is an extension of Randolph, not an undermining of it.

All you've got to do is find one step in the process and essentially outsource it or -- or make it attractive for someone else to perform that particular step and you've essentially invalidated the patent.   Well, but it would be -- when you say it would be written that way, it would be by not claiming one step in the method, I assume, which changes the whole patent.   But you don't know really in every patent whether the tagging is an important part of the process or not.   And how would it -- just to follow up, how would it still be open for the court below? It was decided; en banc review was not granted? Isn't that done?   On -- on the direct infringement question?   And they just didn't reach it?   I just want to make clear, you're saying that under existing law, the question presented makes a huge difference; if existing law is changed, it may not make a difference?   I suppose that's true in every case we hear.   You could.   Ms. Anders. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS FOR UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER   You had a third point you were going to make on 271 (a)?   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Panner, four minutes.

12-79 +++$+++        We will hear argument next this morning in Case 12-79, Chadbourne & Parke v. Troice in the consolidated cases. Mr. Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       So if -- if I'm trying to get a home loan and they ask you what assets you have and I list a couple of stocks, and, in fact, it's fraudulent, I don't own them, that's a covered transaction, that's a 10b-5 violation?       The only element of fraud in there was by the bank itself.     They're the only ones whose purchases or sales could be said to have been affected by the misrepresentation.     And of course, they can't -       -- make any claim on that basis.       But somebody else - somebody else was, right?       Not by the purchase or sale, right?     They were affected, according to your theory, by the fact that, oh, they told us there were these stocks, but the actual purchases and sales, the fraud did not go to the purchase and sales of the covered securities; they went to the CDs.       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Goldenberg. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS       Well -- but nobody is suggesting that the SEC can't take action with respect to the noncovered securities.     So to the extent there's diminished confidence in the securities markets, the SEC has all the tools available to address that. The question is the different one under SLUSA.       I mean, in fact, I -- this -- it would inspire confidence to the extent that lawyers can bring these actions, as opposed to having them precluded, which is what you're arguing for. I'm sorry I interrupted you.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement, you have four minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12-842 +++$+++    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-842, the Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital, Ltd. Mr. Blackman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN I. BLACKMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Kneedler? ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER   Counsel, I don't have a very good understanding about how this works in practice. Let's say that the discovery reguest on a French bank, the prevailing party has reason to believe that this is where Argentina deposits its rental income from properties around the United States. They know, they think they know, that Argentina has -- you know, owns a townhouse that it rents out in the United States, and they think they will be able to discover where that is by going to the French bank account and saying, well, every month they get $10,000 from this address in the United States. Can that be discovered or not?   So they can -- so the defendant that -- the prevailing party files a reguest saying, give us anything that has anything to do with assets in the United States on the French bank and that's fine?   Do you leave out the diplomatic --   Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Blackman, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN I. BLACKMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

SCHNEIDER, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER, APPOINTED BY THIS COURT
12-872 +++$+++        Our first case this term is Case 12-872, Madigan v. Levin. Mr. Scodro? ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. SCODRO ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Which question?       This is an -- the qualified immunity question is presented on interlocutory appeal.       Decisions on the merits, factual and legal, are still pending.     Now - now, we have a determination by the district court that Mr. Levin is not an employee.       The prior district court determined that he was.     The Respondents alleged that he was an employee in their complaint.     I presume, depending on how we rule on the qualified immunity issue, the parties may want to revisit their positions on that question as the case goes go forward. And the district court in the first instance, I suppose, would be the one to decide whether they're allowed to revisit the issue in light of the change in his perception of the law or not.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Scodro, you have five minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. SCODRO ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Thank you, counsel.

12-895 +++$+++       We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-895, Rosemond v. United States. Mr. Elwood. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER      Is it -- is it just flight?    I thought there was evidence that they were chasing the people who robbed them.      Well, he jumps in the car and, you know, they're going after them.      Well, it might be - it might be an effort to continue the crime of -- in other words, it might make a difference whether the people who are being chased look and see two guys in the car or three guys in the car.    If somebody says -- and I realize you dispute these facts -- let's go get them and the guy jumps in the car, it seems to me that that's aiding and abetting the underlying illegal activity with knowledge, of course, that guns were used.      Thank you, counsel. Mr. Elwood, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER      Counsel, do you have anything for us on Rule 30?      How did you preserve that objection?
12-9012 +++$+++    We'll hear argument this morning in Case 12-9012, Robers v. United States. Mr. Green. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Green, you have 5 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   Well, but the only reason he would have been trespassing is because, in fact, he did not live in the house as he promised the bank he would when the bank gave him the money.   So why shouldn't he bear the responsibility for that consequence?
12-929 +++$+++        We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 12-929, Atlantic Marine Construction Company v. The United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Mr. Hastings. ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAMS S. HASTINGS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Where can -- where can I find that?       It's not conveniently set forth in any of the papers, right?       Fair enough.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hastings, you have four minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM S. HASTINGS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
12-930 +++$+++    We'll hear argument now in Case 12-930, Mayorkas v. Cuellar de Osorio. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   Thank you, counsel. Ms. Goldenberg, four minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   Well, it's not so odd to say they've got a priority date in their pocket when the statute says the original priority date -- they'll retain the original priority date.   Hold or maybe retain.   You can finish -- finish that sentence.
12-9490 +++$+++    We'll hear argument in Case 12-9490, Navarette v. California. Mr. Kleven. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. KLEVEN, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS, APPOINTED BY THIS COURT   So if the tip -- so if the tip is, is this car is driving by and throwing bombs out the window, okay, every -- you know, whatever, 500 yards, the police find the car, they have to wait until they see the person actually throw a bomb out the window themselves, before pulling them over?   So your answer is yes, the car is going there, and he's throwing a bomb out, and it goes off, but he has to wait till he sees them throw out another bomb?   Well, what if you have caller ID. I mean, you have one of these anonymous flip phones, right? You can buy them, it's prepaid. You call up and say, I'm -- you know, John Smith, I've seen this, and they look, there's the caller, there's the number. Then they can do it.   Well, isn't that all caller ID gives you?   Do we have any indication that this is a serious problem? The false tips?   Well, is that  is that true? I mean, how many people die from drunk driving versus how many people dry--die from firearms?   I was just going to say, we have held that the -- the standards are loosened in the vehicle context because your expectation of privacy is diminished when you're out on the road driving along in -- in a vehicle. Does that have any pertinence?   What if there's no way for the officer to corroborate the allegation? You know, you see -- see somebody on the street grab a young child, throw her in the trunk of the car, and then take off. And somebody calls with an anonymous tip saying, this fellow -- you know, in this car, has got a child in the trunk. The police can follow the person -- you know, for hours and they're not going to see any corroborating evidence. Can they pull that car over?   So just -- your answer in that case is that the police cannot pull that car over?   Well, let's expand it a little bit. It's a -- it's a one-lane -- two-lane road going down, but it merges into -- you know, an eight-lane expressway. You have one police car. It's going to be hard for that police car to maintain surveillance. And you say they've just got to let them go.   Well, just in terms of your position, over?   Really? Okay.   So the -- the atomic bomb, the level of danger is great enough, but the young girl in the trunk, the level of danger is not great enough?   Well, but you -- what if -- what if the person said, okay, my name is this -- you know, my phone number is this; this guy drove me off the road. They can't corroborate that until they stop the guy. Or you're saying they have to? They have to wait, they have to make the call, see if the guy is there. Are you the guy that just called? So that guy's got to talk on his cell phone while he's driving.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kleven, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. KLEVEN, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS, APPOINTED BY THIS COURT   Yes, I have another one, too.   So somebody has five drinks and goes and gets in the car, that's not intentionally trying to harm someone? Or recklessly trying to harm --   Thank you, counsel.

MADDREY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Well, but it can -- it can participate in that process, can't it?     Its -- its money's at issue?       Thank you, counsel. General Maddrey, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. MADDREY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
12-99 +++$+++       We will hear argument first in Case 12-99.    Unite Here Local 355 v. Mulhall. Mr. MCCracken? ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. MCCRACKEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER      And the list -- the list of -- the list of employees.      Oh, I see.      Sometimes there's a conflict between two different groups that want to unionize the same workforce, right?      How would this work in that case?    Let's say the employer gave -- entered in an agreement like this with one union that wanted to organize the same workforce but not the other.      Doesn't that suggest it's a thing of value in -- in this context?      Are the agreements -- are the agreements uniform or do they have varying elements?      Is -- is the card check provision standard?      Thank you, counsel.      Yes, of course.      Mr. Dreeben. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER      Well, if -- if there -      If I may?      But if you recall the point you made earlier, the point is, yes, voluntary agreement, but if a majority of the workforce wants to be organized and represented by that union, and the argument here, as I understand it, is that this agreement taints that process, in particular, by allowing the card check procedure that it has been argued exercises coercion against employees to support the union.      The argument that the card check -      Well, will you - will you concede that they're more coercive than a secret ballot?      The union organizer comes up to you and says, well, here's a card.    You can check I want to join the union, or two, I don't want a union.    Which will it be?    And there's a bunch of your fellow workers gathered around as you fill out the card.      Thank you, counsel. Mr. MCCracken, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. MCCRACKEN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER      Well, but there was a promise to exercise the First Amendment rights in a particular way up to the amount of $100,000.      That -- that's a little different.
12-992 +++$+++    We will hear argument next this morning in Case 12-992, Ray Haluch Gravel Company v. The Central Pension Fund. Mr. Himmelfarb. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   Why would the case be over? Presumably, you incurred attorneys' fees, seeking to recover the attorneys' fees.   Well, but I thought, with respect to pre-litigation attorneys' fees, you said you can treat those differently because they're set and determined. You know what they are. It would seem to me, in most cases of an auditor's report, that's also true.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Himmelfarb, four minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
13-115 +++$+++    We'll hear argument this morning in Case 13-115, Wood v. Moss. Mr. Gershengorn. ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   Is that a relevant -- well, what is your position on that? Is it pertinent in analyzing gualified immunity that there's no private right of action for the asserted constitutional violation?   But I don't mean what the Court could consider.   I want to know whether or not -- well, the guestion is simple. Can you only -- can you not violate the Constitution if there's no right of action against you, or do you look and say, well, whether there's a right of action or not, it still violates the Constitution?   Answer Justice Kennedy's guestion.   Justice --   Justice Alito has been trying to get a question in.   I don't think that's responsive to Justice Kagan's hypothetical. Justice Scalia's hypothetical, there is an objective reason for stopping the car. It's violating traffic regulations, which is the broken taillight. I understood my colleague's question to be there is no objective security rationale.   Well, no. I thought the question was there's no differential security rationale. In other words, maybe it's not the question my colleague asked, but I'll --   -- I'll ask it.   Let's say you have to move the President in an emergency situation. You've got two options, go through the anti-Bush crowd or go through the pro-Bush crowd, and you've got to do it right away. Is it a justified security rationale to say that we think it's more likely that it will be problematic if you evacuate the President through the anti-Bush crowd than through the pro-Bush crowd?   So in other words, the viewpoint itself constitutes a security consideration?   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gershengorn, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   You can finish your sentence.
13-132 +++$+++    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13-132, Riley v. California. Mr. Fisher? ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER   Including information that is specifically designed to be made public. I mean, what about something like Facebook or a Twitter account? There's no real -- there's no -- any privacy interest in a Facebook account is at least diminished because the point is you want these things to be public and seen widely.   So I guess my question would be: Could you have a rule that the police are entitled to search those apps that, in fact, don't have an air of privacy about them?   More -- more or less limited. I mean, you know, maybe it's 20 people; maybe it's a hundred people. But it's certainly not private in the sense that many of the other applications are.   If I could just   -- on the same lines as -- as Justice Scalia. The point you make elsewhere in your brief and argument is that the cell phone or the -- the smartphone has everything.   It's got the person's whole life. Well, if you're arresting somebody on the grounds of suspicion that he's a gang member and you have evidence to support that, what part of the smartphone is not likely to have pertinent evidence? What application is not? I mean, here you've got pictures, you've got videos, you've got calls. I just -- I guess it's similar to what other issues have been raised. I don't know what a magistrate is supposed to put in the warrant.   You don't think his banking app -- his banking app is going to say on this day he deposited $10,000 into his account, and then that's going to coincide with a particular drug deal.   What if you have a device that doesn't have the broad information that a smartphone has, but only a very limited, like a Fitbit that tells you how many steps you've taken, and the defendant says, I've been in my house all afternoon, and they want to check and see if he's walked 4 miles. It's not his whole life, which is a big part of your objection. Is that something they can look at?   I'm going to say something first.   If -- if the phone rings, can the police answer it?   Is it significant in -- in this case that the information was not protected by a password?   That doesn't -- that doesn't affect the expectation of privacy?   No. I know they argue that it doesn't matter, but I'm just wondering if your position is weakened by the fact that the individual did not seek the greater protection of a password.   Thank you, counsel. 4 minutes, Mr. Fisher. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
13-193 +++$+++    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13-193, Susan B. Anthony List v. Steven Driehaus. Mr. Carvin? ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   Do you want us to just forget about the disclaimer issue and the commission procedure issue or even the as-applied issue? I got the sense from particularly footnote 7 in your reply brief that you're happy to just have those taken off the board.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PARTIAL REVERSAL   Well, you -- you insist that they -- there has actually been a probable cause finding that their speech would violate the law before they would have standing?   Even in a case like this, where the procedures can be triggered by any citizen in the State?   Is that a realistic proposition? I mean, first of all, in the first place, surely you don't expect them to come in and say, I'm going to say something totally false and I'm afraid I might be prosecuted for that. But then you have to say they have -- you would never imagine that somebody else might think in a hotly contested election that their speech is false?   How many proceedings have been brought under this Ohio statute?   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Carvin, you have 5 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

13-299 +++$+++    We'll hear argument this morning in Case 13-299, Clark versus Rameker. Mr. Shanmugam. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS   Well, you still have the problem of figuring out set aside, you know, by -- by whom. It seems to me that if you inherit one of these IRAs and somebody, you know, asked you about it, you could say, well, my mother -- you know, you wouldn't say, would you, my mother left me a retirement account? You would say my mother left me $300,000.   I know, but I think it's more likely that you would be describing -- if you said a retirement account, it would seem to me to be confusing to the normal English speaker, while if you say what the amount is, I mean, that's what you got and you could take it all out the next day, which is why the retirement aspect would seem to be incidental.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shanmugam, you have 5 minutes remaining -- I'm sorry, 6 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
13-301 +++$+++    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13-301, United States v. Clarke. Ms. Harrington. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS   Justice Alito.   Counsel, could I -- we hear that argument a lot, that there's never been any showing of any problem in these other circuits. But do you have any study to support that? I mean, is it -- I don't know that we -- how you would tell. I mean, because these -- these proceedings, not everybody is going to say I'm going to appeal, particularly facing the IRS, and go forward. Do you have any basis for the argument that this has not been a problem in the other circuits other than the fact that what, we haven't had a case yet or the courts of appeals haven't had a case?   Well, not necessarily great. One thing that -- when we articulate a new standard, sometimes we like to apply it to the particular case to give clearer guidance over exactly what we mean.   And in this case -- and particularly here when we're not being asked to resolve a legal question in the particular case, we're just trying to say what do you need to show a hearing -- require a hearing. They've got more -- you know, they've got more than just a bare allegation. They've got the summons -- first of all, it's the third request for an extension. They've got the summons immediately after they refuse to grant it. They've got a contention that this is to circumvent the Tax Court's limits. They support that by the fact that when Moog came for the deposition, you only had the Tax Court lawyers there, not Mr. Freefielder who was -- Frierfielder, who was running the investigation. That's more than just a bare allegation.   There were -- there were three or four, not two.   I'm sorry. Maybe because it's a tax case, if you could slow down just a little bit.   No. It's a little bit more than that. It's the third request for an extension. And how often does the IRS request the taxpayers to waive the statute of limitations?   Well, I know. But Congress has established these statutes of limitations, and the IRS has enormous leverage. They're sitting here saying, well, we could file this thing saying you owe $150,000 in taxes or you might -- or you could give us more time and we'll think about it longer. And my sense, just from looking at the cases that come in and cert petitions, that happens almost always. They're always saying give us more time, give us more time. And I don't know how many times it happens three different times -- I mean three successive --   And we want you to do it within whatever the statute of limitations period is.   Thank you, counsel. 4 minutes, Ms. Harrington. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
13-316 +++$+++    We'll hear argument this morning in case 13-316, Loughrin v. United States. Mr. Russell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   Well, but the breadth is confined -- given the development of the banking system, it may not seem as significant a limitation today as in years past. But, nonetheless, the definition of a financial institution is -- in 18 U.S.C 20 is limited to institutions with a particular Federal nexus. Federal Deposit Insurance, Federal Home Loan Bank, Small Business Investment Act. It isn't any financial institution, but institutions in which the Federal Government has a particular interest.   Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Russell. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
13-317 +++$+++    We'll hear argument this morning in Case 13-317, Halliburton Company v. The Erica P. John Fund. Mr. Streett. ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON STREETT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   Could I ask you   I  I understand your friend on the other side to acknowledge that the efficient market theory is not perfect, that there are situations in which events are not reflected in the market price. I understand you to acknowledge that it's accurate to some extent, but that the exceptions or the -- the extent to which it's not accurate over -- override the extent to which it is. In other words, you're each sort of dealing with at the -- at the -- if not at the margins, you know, most of the time it's efficient; you say too much of the time it's not. How am I supposed to review the economic literature and decide which of you is correct on that?   No, your submission is that we should jettison the Basic test because economists now believe that the efficient market theory is not sufficient -- sufficiently accurate or true to support it. So I thought -- I mean, you review a lot of the economic literature in your briefs. I assume you wanted me to look at it.   Well, how hard is it to show that the New York Stock Exchange is an efficient market?   So I would think the event study they are talking about would be a lot more difficult and laborious to demonstrate than market efficiency in a typical case.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Streett, you have 5 minutes remaining. 5 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. STREETT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

13-354 +++$+++    We'll hear argument this morning in consolidated cases Number 13-354, Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services v. Hobby Lobby Stores; and 13-356, Conestoga Wood Specialties Corporation v. Sebelius. Mr. Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PARTIES   I thought -- I thought that part of the religious commitment of the owners was to provide health care for its employees.   She's right about that. (Laughter.)   Thank you, General. Mr. Clement, four minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF PRIVATE PARTIES
13-369 +++$+++    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13-369, Nautilus v. Biosig Instruments. Mr. Vandenberg. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. VANDENBERG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   But it can't mean any spacing, because anyone skilled in the art would know the hand has to cover it. So you're basically talking about a fairly narrow range between one side of the hand and the other and not too close together but they don't -- don't work. And that seems to me that someone skilled in the art can just try a couple of things and see where -- where the trial and error. Trial and error makes -- could mean a very difficult thing, like Edison discovering what works in a light bulb. But here you've got a very limited range and someone skilled in the art will just, well, let's try it, you know, close to the middle, let's try it to so far apart. But it's not any spaced relationship.   Do you -- do you have any disagreement with a standard that's articulated by the Solicitor General? He says that, you know, a patent satisfies the requirement if, in light of the specification and the prosecution history, a person skilled in the art would reasonably understand the scope of the claim.   Well, that's what I'm having trouble dealing with. I would suspect your friends on the other side will say yes, right, that they accept that, too. And you say, but it can't be insolubly ambiguous or not amenable to construction. And they say, well, that's not really what the Federal Circuit said. So until we get to the application, I don't see much disagreement among any of you about the standard or what's wrong with the Federal Circuit's articulation. And the questions kind of suggest we move very quickly into the particular invention and the application. And I'm just -- I'm curious what you want us to do if it seems like in every case, we have to get right into the application rather than the legal standards.   Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Vandenberg. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN D. VANDENBERG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
13-461 +++$+++    We'll hear argument next in Case 13-461, American Broadcasting Companies v. Aereo. Mr. Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   Why isn't -- and I don't want to stretch you too far -- why isn't it like a public garage in your own garage? I mean, you know, if you -- you can park your car in your own garage or you can park it in a public garage. You can go to Radio Shack and buy an antenna and a DVR or you can rent those facilities somewhere else from Aereo. They've -- they've got an antenna. They'll let you use it when you need it and they can, you know, record the stuff as well and let you pick it up when you need it.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS   Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Clement, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
13-483 +++$+++    We'll hear argument next in Case 13-483, Lane v. Franks. Mr. Singh? ORAL ARGUMENT OF TEJINDER SINGH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   Is there a different Eleventh -- Is there a different Eleventh Circuit case he should have looked at? I mean, you don't think this is close, but is there a closer precedent that he should have looked at?   Yes, but it was expressly distinguished in Morris.   Those are two very different things. You spend a fair amount of time in your brief talking about court of appeals decisions from other circuits. But I think it's a little bit of a heroic leap to assume that employees are familiar with court of appeals decisions in their own circuit. Do you really think we should be looking at the opinions from other circuits in deciding whether the law was clearly established in a different circuit?   Well, if you say the Eleventh Circuit is out on its own, it seems to me to be a concession that their law is different from the law that you're arguing for. And, again, my point is: Do you ask a -- a State employee to recognize, yes, this is the law in the Eleventh Circuit, but they're out on their own. So we're going to follow a -- a different law?   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gershengorn? 5 ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING AFFIRMANCE IN PART AND REVERSAL IN PART   So you could fire him because he testified?   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Singh, you have 5 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TEJINDER SINGH. ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   So the Eleventh Circuit really got it wrong.   But it's still the precedent that governs in this situation unless you're going to have the employees analyze the law in the other circuits or unless you're going to have the employees look at the Eleventh Circuit opinion and say, I know that's what it says, but it's wrong.   So you're reguiring the government employee in this case to be a better analyzer of Supreme Court precedent than the three Eleventh Circuit judges.
132, Orig. +++$+++              We will hear argument first this morning in Case 132 on our original docket, Alabama v. North Carolina. Mr. Phillips. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS              Would your position be the -- be the same if it were $20 million?              So whatever the Commission contributed?       In other words, it doesn't have to be enough to trigger an obligation on the part of North Carolina to move forward.              I assume there is some level where you would say, you know, they took their chances, and it didn't work out -- as opposed to they obviously committed in light of the money they accepted.              No, I don't think so.   I think it's a question of whether there's a breach.   I would say that if you gave them $1 million, you should not view that as:              Well, we've supported your efforts; you are committed to do this, no matter how much it costs, because we have given you $1 million. It seems to me at some point the amount becomes pertinent in assessing whether you have a claim.            Thank you, Mr. Dellinger. Mr. Phillips, have you 10 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS            But then -- but those States couldn't take the money.              They couldn't say, I want my share?            You are saying it was their money, but they had no access to it.
134 ORIG +++$+++                    We'll hear argument next in case 134 on our original docket, New Jersey v. Delaware. Mr. Farr. ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF                  So that if you have one of these wharves that goes beyond the low-water mark and there are two people at the end of it and one of them shoots the other, would they be prosecuted for murder in Delaware or New Jersey?                  I suspect the New Jersey Supreme Court would.                  How do we split that difference?   I mean let's --                  I mean, how do we decide the difference between those two cases?                  And applicable here, for example, let's say it's perfectly fine for New Jersey to build a wharf out there, but they can't use it for liquified natural gas, which Delaware may conclude poses particular problems that other uses don't.                   Then how come your position in my murder hypothetical was what it was? Because I assume murder is not a riparian use either. And yet, why would Delaware have jurisdiction over a casino but not over a crime?                    Thank you, Mr. Farr.                   Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Farr, you have three minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF                    Mr. Farr, can I ask you a question as purely a --                    -- matter of curiosity?   The parties talk about the Duke of York's grant to William Penn in this case, but nobody ever explains where Delaware came from.                   How did that -- where did Delaware -- I mean a grant to William Penn is Pennsylvania.   Where -- when did Delaware --
137, Orig. +++$+++        We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 137 on our original docket, Montana v. Wyoming and North Dakota. General Bullock. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE BULLOCK ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF       But you -- this is where it's been talking about beneficial uses.     What the compact said -- says is appropriative rights to beneficial uses.     And to me that suggests, which I always understood to be the way water law worked in the west, is you have a right to pull out, you know, water, and the appropriative right is you have the right to take out however much you were taking out.     And the fact that less comes back, that's something different.     That doesn't affect your appropriation.       Well, isn't that what's going on here?     The beneficial use is irrigation of crops.     They have an appropriative right to take out so much flow for that.     That's all they're doing. They're doing it now, just as they were back then.     They just use up more of it once they've taken it out.       I don't understand why that's a good -- good answer.     I mean, the beneficial use is that use by which the water supply is depleted.     Well, the use here is irrigation.     It doesn't say irrigation up to the technological development in 1950.     They're still taking out the same amount of water for that beneficial use.     They're using it to irrigate. And if they get better at it so they use more, well, that's just too bad for you.       Thank you, Mr. Jay. General, you have 2 minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE BULLOCK ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
138, Orig. +++$+++                 We will hear argument this afternoon in Case 138 in our original docket, South Carolina v. North Carolina. Mr. Frederick. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF                   I thought your friends agreed that the New Jersey v. New York standard applied?                  I understand your basic argument that each State should represent its own constituents.   But isn't the Catawba River Water Supply Project in a different category?            Because it straddles both States, and I think it can reasonably fear that it would be treated as a stepchild by both States.                I -- I guess I haven't heard yet an answer to Justice Ginsburg's first question about whether there was a recommendation from the Special Master or not.                  Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Miller. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PLAINTIFF                 And why isn't Duke Power -- why isn't Duke Power on the other side, then?

11-398 +++$+++        We will hear argument this morning in Case Number 11-398, Department of Health and Human Services v. Florida. Mr. Long. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG AS THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE       But they would apply even if the rule is not jurisdictional.     The only difference would be that the court could enforce it or not enforce it in particular cases, which brings me to the Davis case, which I think is your biggest hurdle. It's a case quite similar to this in which the constitutionality of the Social Security Act was at issue, and the government waived its right to insist upon the application of this Act. Of course, if it's jurisdictional, you can't waive it.     So, are you asking us to overrule the Davis case?       Well, it seems -- you can't separate those two points.     The idea that Congress has acquiesced in what we have said only helps you if what we have said is fairly consistent.     And you, yourself, point out in the brief that we've kind of gone back and forth on whether this is a jurisdictional provision or not.     So, even if Congress acquiesced in it, I'm not sure what they acquiesced in.       Thank you, Mr. Long. General Verrilli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Justice Ginsburg.       It was -- it was the calculation of the interests of the United States that your predecessor made in the Davis case. There, the Solicitor General exercised authority that we sanctioned to waive the Anti-Injunction Act.     And, of course, that couldn't be done if it were jurisdictional.       It makes it easy for the government to drop the other shoe in the future, right?     You've been under the law subject to this mandate all along.     You've been exempt from the penalty. So, all they have to do is take away the penalty.       Well, except you --       You agree with Mr. Long, isn't -- I mean, I thought you just agreed with Justice Breyer that one of the purposes of the provision is to raise revenue.       Thank you, General.       Mr. Long, you have 5 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG AS THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE       Mr. Long, you were invited by this Court to defend the proposition that the Anti-Injunction Act barred this litigation.     You have ably carried out that responsibility, for which the Court is grateful.
11-400 +++$+++        We will continue argument this afternoon in Case 11-400, Florida v. The Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS       Well, I'm -- I'm not sure my colleagues have exhausted their questions. So --       He doesn't always check first. (Laughter.)       No, let's leave the wife out of it.       That's enough frivolity for a while. But I want to make sure I understand where the meaningfulness of the choice is taken away.     Is it the amount that's being offered, that it's just so much money, of course you can't turn it down, or is it the amount that's going to be taken away if you don't take what they're offering?       Well, why isn't that a consequence of how willing they have been since the New Deal to take the Federal Government's money?     And it seems to me that they have compromised their status as independent sovereigns because they are so dependent on what the Federal Government has done, they should not be surprised that the Federal Government, having attached the -- they tied the strings, they shouldn't be surprised if the Federal Government isn't going to start pulling them.       Thank you, General. Mr. Clement, you have 5 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL BAGENSTOS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   Justice Breyer.   Certainly.   General Verrilli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR. FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER   I would have thought it's those types of cases that present the starkest example of discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, the idiosyncratic one. Oh, well, he's doing this, yes, but he's doing that and then the pregnant woman comes in and says, ah, you know, that's not the same thing. I thought maybe it's the -- the sort of the isolated examples that would be particularly glaring in their discriminatory treatment.   But not if there is a separate category of people who are entitled to benefits for more than one month.   Briefly.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bagenstos, you have four minutes remaining.

MCALLISTER ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF   What if -- you know roughly what the amount of extra -- I don't know what the word -- liability on Nebraska is. What if it were way off? What if the formula resulted in Kansas getting 50 percent more water than the parties anticipated? Still no authority to revise the formula?   I thought the special master specifically found that this was not part of the bargaining tradeoff.   You say -- you say this problem should go to the RCRA process. Each State has a representative. Your -- your representative has an absolute veto in the RCRA process.   So -- so you're feeling pretty good about your chances if you send it back to the RCRA.   Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE S. ISAACSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   So -- so you're saying it's just like garnishment or things like that? It has to be focused on a specific amount that's already been calculated and the taxpayer has not turned over?   So you've got to know that he or she owes $1,482 because they've done the calculations and they haven't paid that over.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Isaacson, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE S. ISAACSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
13-1034 +++$+++    A few moments ago, I understood you to concede when Justice Ginsburg asked the guestion that if there is an exact parallel between the State law and the Federal law, your client would be deportable.   So the fact that there's a -- it's a drug paraphernalia conviction has nothing to do with the -- the issue before us?   So, so long as the drug offense is related to, then the paraphernalia offense is related to? So it doesn't make any difference that we're dealing with paraphernalia?   Well, that's why I would have thought your answers to me would have been different because you would want to say that the paraphernalia is an additional hurdle. Just because the drugs relate to the Federal drugs doesn't mean that you can say the paraphernalia does, because it covers all sorts of things that the Federal law doesn't.   Thank you, cunsel. Mr. Laramore, you have four minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JON LARAMORE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
13-1041 +++$+++    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13-1041, Perez v. the Mortgage Bankers Association and Nichols v. the Mortgage Bankers Association. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   What was the -- was there a particular basis for the change in this case?   Was there a change in the leadership at the agency between those two interpretations?   And they hadn't they hadn't done -- they hadn't addressed the same issues the first time in 2006?   Or the administrations might have changed.   But that's often the case when you have a procedural challenge. I mean, the idea is they're not challenging the particular interpretation, but you don't doubt that the agency could have come out the other way and maybe if there had been notice and comment, they would have been persuaded that they should -- or that they shouldn't change the interpretation.   How often --   Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.   Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Kneedler, you have five minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   Mr. Kneedler, you are not going to go after employers who acted consistent with the prior interpretation between 2006 and 2010 on the ground that they didn't know about the prior interpretative regulation, are you?   Whether they knew about the regulation or not.   No, the point is that's not right because the provision you're citing requires good faith and you told me it doesn't matter whether they know about it or not.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   You don't doubt that if -- if those words appeared in a statute that Congress passed tomorrow, we would not interpret them as a jurisdictional bar, would we?   Thank you, counsel. Ms. Prelogar, you have eight minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER   Well, Mr. Rosenkranz tells us that that language is pretty typical for your ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute of limitations. It sounds pretty daunting, you know, forever barred, but apparently that's the normal language that's used.

GANNON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   I was just going to say your argument that Amtrak is governmental for purposes of -- that doesn't get you to the finish line, right? I mean, if you had a law that said the Department of Defense and the Department of State will consult and jointly issue regulations and if they don't, this private individual resolved it for them, that would still present the same problems.   Right.   You may. You may.   If the -- if the actions are not regulatory, why -- why did Amtrak's performance drop dramatically as soon as the Court issued its decision in this case?   They're going to be -- Amtrak can then force a proceeding at which the freight carriers will have to defend, right?   Well, that's a significant regulatory impact, to tell railroads I, a private party, get to start a governmental proceeding and you have to show up to defend it.   And, by the way, if I don't -- it's triggered if I don't comply with standards that I get to set.   Well, but does that matter? I mean, the idea is that having the arbitrator -- arbitration provision there affected the issuance of the regulations.   If --   Right.   Well, I know -- if I could -- there's -- the issues are pretty intertwined here, so I know it's a difficult thing to keep track of for you. But if -- if -- and for us. But if we think that the regulations have a regulations -- not to load the guestion --   Okay. Metrics and standards are regulations. And if we think there is nothing in the statute that reguires -- well, I guess it doesn't -- doesn't -- doesn't really matter. If that's the case, is the arbitrator an officer of the United States? In other words, if he is the one that ends up issuing what we will hypothetically conclude are regulations, I assume he has to be an officer of the United States.   Thanks. I know it's a -- if he is an officer, is the government's issue a principal officer or an inferior officer?   Okay. Then who which principal officer supervises him?   But he's an arbitrator.   One of the parties to the arbitration.   So if the STB doesn't like the arbitrator's decision, can the STB change it under the law?   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon, you have four minutes remaining.

GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   Well, does the 150-day provision kick in? I mean, you said don't worry about this. District courts can just put it on the back burner for three years, however long. Doesn't the 150-day provision kick in if, in fact, the district court has dismissed all of the claims?   Oh, we could do it ourselves. (Laughter.)   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein, you have six minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
13-1211 +++$+++    We will hear argument next this morning in Case 13-1211, Hana Financial v. Hana Bank. Mr. Hughes. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL W. HUGHES ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   I'm sorry. I lost you a little bit. Why -- why is it going to be a very different type of result?   Is the jury going to be instructed in any way on what you just told us was the reason we should view those as differently?   Wouldn't there be evidence or instruction on, you know, consumer impression, you have to take into account what happened between these two marks?   It seems to me that it's rather critical to the contrast you draw. I mean, what you're saying is the jury might get it right or the jury might get it wrong, and I would say, well, the Federal Circuit maybe got it right or the Federal Circuit got it wrong. But in terms of what the factual issues are going to be, and those would include what's happening between the two marks, it seems to me the jury has got information just the way the Federal Circuit. I don't see the difference between the two other than you think -- you think the one result is right and the other would be wrong.   If it's viewed as a question of fact?   Again, if I could just -- what is it that you think a jury could not be instructed on in addressing that same consideration?   Well, I guess the stare decisis point is -- is minimized, though, if you appreciate the fact that these marks are -- each one is sort of sui generis. I mean, I don't know what precedential value I can get from looking at, you know, the dolphin changes on page 50 by the fact that there is a case about the Loctite Corporation behind. I mean, I'm sure some are similar, but it seems to me that each one is -- is significantly different, so I don't know the significance of the stare decisis in this context.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hughes, you have 6 minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL W. HUGHES ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
13-1333 +++$+++    We'll hear argument next in Case 13-1333, Coleman v. Tollefson. Mr. Shanmugam. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER   In a case such as that, is there anything preventing the Plaintiff from getting a stay of the District Court judgment? The third strike, seeking a stay of the judgment, and if in fact it is because of a failure to state a claim, so has more merit than one of the frivolous ones, I suppose the Court of Appeals could grant a stay, and the problem we're addressing would totally go away.   Yeah, but that's a problem that is always presented when you have to ask a District Court to stay its own judgment. But you can also ask the Court of Appeals, right?   No, you stay the judgment. Because the judgment -- I mean, that's the typical reason you ask for a stay is because the judgment is going to have some very adverse conseguences that should be suspended pending appeal.   The remedy will be stayed in effect, of the third strike.   Are you suggesting that the District Court cannot stay the disposition of the case? Or that a Court of Appeals has to review it or going to be asked to review it can't stay it?   I'm sorry, isn't that what stays do? They suspend the effectiveness of the judgment and by doing so you stay any collateral consequences of it?   Thank you, counsel.

ORTIZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   Why isn't -- is that enough for your client? He wants to sell the firearms to -- the government is willing to let a licensed firearms dealer sell them for him?   I would have thought -- I would have thought you would oppose the notion that that would be an adeguate -- adeguate relief. If we're talking about an attribute of ownership, the owner gets to decide who -- to whom he's going to sell what he owns.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ortiz, you have 14 minutes remaining.

You know, if we meet somewhere and I take out a tablet and write something down and hand it to you. Is that written or oral? It's at least not oral.   In person.   Thank you, counsel.

13-212 +++$+++    We'll hear argument next in Case 13-212, United States v. Wurie. Welcome back. (Laughter.) ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER   It's very hard to see how that limit would be applied. You can see and the police would be able to articulate why almost every application, every entry in a cellphone would reasonably be anticipated to have evidence of a particular crime. Obviously e-mails, obviously call logs. Even, you know, Facebook. I mean, if it's a weapons crime, maybe they've got pictures of themselves with guns. I mean, I have trouble imagining what application, what entry police could not say it's reasonably likely that there would be evidence of the crime.   Well, they've got their own technological front in this battle, too, and that's -- I mean, to the extent there are flaws in the Faraday bag, I wouldn't be surprised if that's not improved over the next months or years or whatever.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON SHANMUGAM ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   So if I say or the company says in a prospectus, we believe that we have 3.5 million units of inventory in our secret inventory warehouse, so long as they say we believe, they can't -- you know, it turns out they have none, that's all right? They're still protected?   Really, you think it's an open question if they say it's a very precise number for something that only they know anything about, and it's wildly off, you think they're protected or may be simply by saying "We believe"?   Justice Scalia.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shanmugam, you have seven minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
13-502 +++$+++    We will hear argument first this morning in Case 13-502, Reed v. Town of Gilbert. Mr. Cortman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID CORTMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   Your -- your argument does not turn on the fact that it's a church's sign, does it? I mean, you -- your argument would be the same if this is a temporary sign about where the soccer game was going to be?   I  I'm sorry. That was the significance of my prior guestion. What -- what they're really saying is that political speech is more valuable than speech about where the soccer game is. In other words, I thought you indicated that your argument did not depend on the fact that the sign was a sign for the church.   Don't you think that political speech is more valuable than directions to the soccer game?   So your point is if it's -- if it's stuck in the ground with a little stake --   -- then it can be treated one way, but if it's in concrete -- but --   It seems to me that you are trying to find a, I don't know, a difficult way to deal with an issue that could be readily addressed just by seeing if the sign is for a limited event. In other words, what if somebody -- every time -- you know, the stake in the ground at least could last for three weeks, so every three weeks, they come along and stick the stake back in the ground. You are saying the only way they can distinguish is by looking at whether it has a stake in the ground or whether it's in concrete, and yet that seems to me that doesn't help the -- that doesn't answer the city's legitimate concern.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cortman, you have four minutes remaining. 3 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. CORTMAN ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
13-517 +++$+++    We'll here argument next in case 13-517, Warger v. Shauers. Mr. Shanmugam. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   I'm sorry. I didn't follow that. You said lawyers always have an interest in talking to -- what's to prevent them if the payoff could be as significant as you're looking for.   Well, it's pretty ambiguous. She said if -- if she had been sued, she would have to pay a lot of damages, right? Well, this guy has been sued. I mean, I don't know that you can just take that and says that means she's not going to award a judgment in favor of the -- of the plaintiff.   I guess the reason I ask is precisely for that reason. In other words, it's a fairly broad inguiry. The circumstances in which you would allow an inguiry are fairly broad. It's not simply when there's a smoking gun, but a very debatable point about, well, she -- she didn't want to award damages because if her daughter had been sued it would ruin her life, as opposed to, well, she realized there'd be a lot of damages here because the guy was sued.   Is -- under your reading of 606(b), is there anything that is an inguiry into the validity of a verdict other than a motion to set aside the verdict?   Well, what would -- that motion would be presumably a motion to set aside the verdict.   The reason I ask is because they don't say that. It seems to me a broader definition of any inguiry into the validity of a verdict. If they wanted to say, you know -- if they only meant a motion to set aside a verdict, you'd think they would have said that.   Mr. Shanmugam, you have 7 minutes remaining.

MOOPPAN ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER   Why is a statute that says do what you want not clearly articulated?   It says clearly -- do what you want so long as it promotes the dental -- monopoly of dentists.   So it's not enough just to say, oh, you're a public agent or you're a public official.   But none of that's responsive to the concern that the State policy is purely to displace competition by promoting the self-interest of the dentist.   They can do that in open meeting. They can do that with let anyone look at the records but --   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Mooppan, you have 4 minutes remaining. 0 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HASHIM M. MOOPPAN ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

13-553 +++$+++    We'll hear argument next in Case No. 13-553, the Alabama Department of Revenue v. CSX Transportation. General Brasher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. BRASHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   Well, if they're not similarly situated, then railroad loses.   But that's a different guestion than saying what class they should be compared to.   No, but they wanted to prop up -- they wanted to support the rail industry in a number of ways. And it seems odd to say in a -- in a situation where they were giving them this much money, they still wanted to expose them to unfair competition by States that want to give other modes of transportation a tax benefit, but not to them.   And their that's -- their economic viability depends upon how they're faring with respect to their competitors, not how they're, you know, faring with respect to, you know, an agricultural conglomerate in the State.   Well, no. They compete against trucks, too.   You -- you tax the water carriers when they move within Alabama?   How is that -- how is that consistent with the statute admitting Alabama to the Union, which says the water -- the first time -- the water will remain -- forever remain public highways without any tax, duty, impost or toll?   Thank you, counsel. General Brasher, you have five minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. BRASHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   Anything you can give us on barges?
13-604 +++$+++    Our first case this morning is Heien v. North Carolina. Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   I understood you to say earlier that you don't take -- distinguishing the exclusionary rule in gualified immunity, you don't take reasonableness into account when it comes to a mistake of law?   Well, but the Fourth Amendment --   I'm sorry, go ahead.   But the -- but the Fourth Amendment itself protects only against unreasonable searches and seizures by its term. I don't understand. It would seem to me that there's a stronger argument for taking the reasonableness of the officer's actions into account when you're talking about a mistake of law, because that's what the Fourth Amendment says, as opposed to remedies and gualified immunity.   If I could just pause.   I thought we said exactly that in Herring, though, where we said that even though we're going to look at it in terms of remedy, that was not to say that the reasonableness didn't go to whether there was a substantive violation of the Fourth Amendment.   Well, if you put aside --   I was just saying, putting aside our discussion of Prouse and -- and Herring, why does it make sense to say that you don't take reasonableness into account when the Fourth Amendment only protects against unreasonable searches and seizures?   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher, you have three minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
13-628 +++$+++    We'll hear argument first in Case 13-628, Zivotofsky versus Kerry. Ms. Lewin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALYZA LEWIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   I suppose -- I suppose you could also say Hamilton in 1787 or whatever it was trumped Story in 1830, right? I mean, he said pretty much the exact opposite, that the recognition provision was really just a trivial formality.   So you would say in Justice Kagan's hypothetical, maybe the letter that's required to be sent to every foreign head of state would be unconstitutional, but that doesn't mean that the passport is, because the passport is used primarily for purposes of identification, and it's only the letter that makes it something else.

13-6827 +++$+++    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13-6827, Holt versus Hobbs. Mr. Laycock. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS LAYCOCK ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER   But I  I mean, you're really just making your case too easy. I mean, one of the difficult issues in a case like this is where to draw the line. And you just say, well, we want to draw the line at half inch because that lets us win. And the next day someone's going to be here with one inch. And maybe it'll be you. And then, you know, two inches. It seems to me you can't avoid the legal difficulty just by saying, all we want is half an inch.   Well, but we have to decide this case pursuant to a generally applicable legal principle, and that legal principle is one, it seems to me, that demands some sort of a limit. And if you're unwilling to articulate a limit to the principle itself, it becomes a little bit difficult to apply it, say, well, we don't know what the limit is because you're only asking a half inch. We'll apply a -- a theoretical legal structure and -- and say you fall within it.   Well, the -- the problem with deference, I think, is that if you accept the fact that there is a point at which it does become a problem, the full beard, Sikh with the -- the turban, then you -- then there's the guestion of how you draw the line. And drawing the line, it strikes me, may be the point at which you will consider deference to the prison administrators. You take deference entirely out of the eguation by saying, look, we're only asking for half an inch.   Thank you, Professor. Mr. Yang? ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER   Go ahead.   It sounds like statute.   Where -- where are you on the full beard?   Well, assuming that's the case, assuming they have some evidence of concealment or whatever in -- in a full beard, what do we do? Just litigate a dozen cases till we settle on one and three guarters inches, or what?   What I'm doing, it's the same guestion I asked your friend --   -- which is what's the legal principle? And if there is no direct legal principle, then isn't it a situation in which you would employ deference to the administrative judgment?   Thank you, counsel.   Thank you, counsel. Professor Laycock, you have five minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

BERRETH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   I'm not sure you're joining issue with the guestion Justice Kagan asked. Do we really not know why the Tenth Circuit did what it did in this case?   But the dissenters in the case thought -- explain why they thought it was wrong. Don't you think if the Tenth Circuit relied on a different reason they would have said so?   Do you think it's appropriate for this Court to dismiss certiorari, in other words, the case is not before us, and then opine on the merits of the case?   I thought the suggestion was that we tell the Tenth Circuit that this was wrong?   Well, if we simply dismiss certiorari, what do you think we have the authority to say other than the reasons for dismissing certiorari?   How can -- how can we remand for an appropriate consideration of the factors if we don't say that what took place was inappropriate?   Mr. Berreth, you have three minutes remaining.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   And that remedy is a new -- a new trial.   What if -- what if -- what if one claim is the ineffective assistance and the other claim is a violation of the confrontation clause?   And you -- and you -- when -- when you go back, they can repeat the error or they can choose not to call their witness, either way. And it would seem to me that if you didn't file a cross-appeal, that the Federal court decision would be an advisory opinion on the confrontation clause.   Right.   Thank you, counsel.

13-854 +++$+++    We will hear argument first this morning in Case 13-854, Teva Pharmaceuticals v. Sandoz. Mr. Jay. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. WILLIAM M. JAY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   You -- you've referred several times to subsidiary facts. You know, the difference between guestions of law and fact has not always been an easy one for the Court to draw. What do you mean by a subsidiary fact?   Well, what's your definition of subsidiary fact?   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jay, 3 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS   Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.
13-894 +++$+++    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13-894, the Department of Homeland Security v. Robert MACLean. Mr. Gershengorn. ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   But it -- it certainly is -- will, in many cases, be a close guestion. I was very surprised to see in your reply brief the recognition that the employee can -- just to guote it -- "can tell the media that Federal air marshals will be absent from important flights, but declining to specify which flights." I think it would be very difficult to figure out what's SSI and what's not if -- given that kind of fine line.   And could he say, there will -- air marshals have been cut 50 percent from, you know, transcontinental flights?   Heard what contention?   Okay. Well, what about my guestion? Could somebody say that the number of air marshals on transcontinental flights has been cut 50 percent?   So how was Mr. MACLean supposed to know?   Well, your reasoning is --   -- would -- it apparently came as a surprise to the government lawyer in the court of appeals. He said, I'll be as clear as I can. Specifically prohibited by law here means statute.   Again, the MACLean is supposed to know something that the lawyer -- government lawyer and the court of appeals doesn't know.   I'm sorry, what was that guoted from?   Yes. But what's so hard about duplicating the SSI system? He signs an executive order saying duplicate the SSI system and right away the problem we have here of people like Mr. MACLean revealing information is not a problem anymore because it is then protected by executive order.   Well, about -- you talked about what Congress meant and set up. But the conference report says the language does not refer to agency rules and regulations. So, whatever staffers prepared that, and I'm not suggesting Congress did, but whatever staffers prepared that, again, MACLean had to know more than they did.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gershengorn you have 4 minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
13-895 +++$+++    We'll hear argument in Case Number 13-895, Alabama Legislative Black Caucus in Alabama -- v. Alabama, and Case 13-1138, the Alabama Democratic Conference v. Alabama. Mr. Pildes. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD PILDES ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS   So you want, on the one hand -- they obviously had to move new voters into the majority-minority districts because they were all underpopulated, and they need to move enough so that the minorities have an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice, but they can't move too many because that would be packing, correct?   So -- but they have to do that. They have to hit this sweet spot between those two extremes without taking race predominantly into consideration?   Why is that? Why is --   Why is that? Why do you no longer need as high a percentage of minority voters to maintain a situation where minority voters can still elect their candidates of choice?   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Schnapper. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS   And you think it's possible for the State to navigate between not enough minority members in the district and too many minority members in the district without taking race into account.   Race predominantly into account.   So -- so they have to navigate between too many and too few, but without race being the predominant consideration.   Do you think -- what do you think -- well, it's speculative. But I think that if Alabama had reduced the number of minority voters in majority-minority districts in any significant way, the Attorney General would have come down on them like a ton of bricks.   He did preclear the plan that you're challenging today.   Thank you, counsel. Professor Pildes, you have two minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD PILDES ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
13-9026 +++$+++    We will now hear argument next this morning in Case No. 13-9026, Whitfield v. United States. Mr. Carpenter. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA B. CARPENTER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   Is it contextual? In other words, is 20 feet in her home different from 20 feet in the bank?   But it seems -- the reason I ask is that it -- it strikes me that it makes a difference if it's in part of the robbery itself. I mean, it seems to me to tell the teller to go to the vault or something. That's what happens in a bank robbery. If on the other hand, the -- the defendant takes the teller from the bank to the car and then, you know, they -- they block the car, that strikes me as something different even though the distance might be the same.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Carpenter, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA B. CARPENTER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Mr. Gannon. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS   Counsel, on the consent question, is -- under your theory, is there anything wrong with Congress adding a proviso to every Federal contract saying the contractor hereby agrees to waive any Article III objections to having disputes with the government resolved by something we'll call the congressional courts where the -- the individuals serve for 3 years and Congress has a lot more sway over their decisions?   I thought it was an unforgettable question. (Laughter.)   Well, there's judicial control in the sense that you have deferential appellate review and whatnot, but it still takes out of the Federal courts our constitutional birthright to decide cases and controversies under Article III.   It's hard for me to see how --   -- sort of vague -- vague notions of, oh, well, the judges are involved there somewhere.   Counsel. Justice Kagan.   Thank you, counsel.

FISHER ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER   Justice Alito.   No, that's not -- I'm sorry, go ahead.   But that's not all you want. Let's say on Monday you get a letter that says your application is denied. And on Friday the city council says the reasons we denied the application were because of this, this, and this. Is that enough for you?   No.   It doesn't matter that four days or three days, whatever is later, there is a resolution that doesn't say it's denied, it says the reason we denied it is this. That's not good enough?   I know.   It has to be in a single document. What if it's stapled together? You know, here's one, it says denied. And here's one saying, the next day, the reasons we denied it is -- are these.   No, no. What if they're not stapled together?   But do you -- I'm sorry.   Well, before you do so, why is the transcript reguired? They had minutes that summarized the testimony. Your position is not that the transcript had to be attached.   But if the -- I'm sorry.   I may not have followed this. If the transcript were attached, what?   Oh, okay.   Thank you, counsel.

ELWOOD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   Yeah, you are going to find a lot of information on the cell phone that the guy is really angry at his ex-wife and -- and, you know, would like to see her suffer. And he's going to put it online, and then you are going to say, well, that was just therapeutic, as you said in your brief. It was therapeutic. Yes, of course, it shows that he was going to do something dangerous. It's a good thing that he had this outlet of the internet so he didn't have to do it.   How does the fact -- I thought your whole point was the fact that she is in fear doesn't tell you enough about what the defendant wants.   Based on your submission, all he has to do is say either, as I understood your brief, it's therapeutic, it's a good thing I could do this, or it's art.   It's not just a reasonable person, at least as I understand the government's submission. It's a reasonable person familiar with the context of the statement. Right? So you don't take what is on the Internet in the abstract and say, this person wants to do something horrible. You are familiar with the context. You are familiar with the fact that this was a couple of teenagers in a chat room playing a game, right?   5 minutes, Mr. Elwood. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   Mm-hmm.
13-9972 +++$+++    We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 13-9972, Rodriguez v. The United States. Mr. O'Connor. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHANNON P. O'CONNOR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   Counsel, do you concede that this would be all right if the dog sniff took place during the traffic stop? In other words, let's say, there were, you know, two -- two policemen there already. One says, I'm going to go write you a ticket and while that's taking place, the other policeman walks around with the dog. No problem with that?   Justice Sotomayor.   What if the officer says, I need to think about this for a while?   What if the officer says -- says, I need to think about this for a while?   The officer says, I need to think about this for a while. I'm going to go back and I'm going to ponder how long it took you. I'm going to think about other tickets I've given in the past, and, you know, the dogs are going to be here in 8 minutes. I think I need about 10 minutes to think about it. Is that -- is that okay, since he has not -- he hasn't written a ticket? He waits, you know, until he's thought about it for a while to write the ticket.   Is that okay?   What about the registration is pertinent to the traffic stop?   If you saw -- if you saw --   If you saw the car swerve, what does that have to do with the car? The car was just doing what the driver did. And I don't see why you need the registration of the car.   He can -- I mean, one reason I think they do the records check, the officer needs to know who he's dealing with. I think one of the higher incidences of when officers are shot or wounded is when they make a traffic stop. So if you run the registration, you see it's a stolen car, you need to know that before you go back and deal with the driver and other occupants. What if the police officer determines that he's -- he's concerned about that, either as a general matter or as a specific matter. He takes the license and registration, but he's not going to go back to the car until he has backup. Okay? So he calls ahead and said, I would -- you know, I would like backup. And the person says, you know, it's going to take 25 minutes, and he says, fine. Is that a legitimate reason? The traffic stop isn't over, because he's -- he doesn't want to go back because he's alone and he doesn't know who these guys are.   So he can call back. Now -- now, okay, what if the backup is a canine unit? The canine unit gets there, you've told us it hasn't been prolonged, and as the officer goes up to give him the warning the dog walks around the car. Is that all right?   Thank you, Ms. Anders. Mr. O'Connor, you have six minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHANNON P. O'CONNOR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
14-103 +++$+++    We'll hear argument next today in Case No. 14-103, Baker Botts v. ASARCO. Mr. Streett. ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON STREETT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   Well, but just -- on the parity point, if you're not doing bankruptcy work and you send the client a bill and they don't pay it, if you've got to take litigation action or whatever, you don't get paid -- you don't get those fees back. We follow the normal American rule and you pay your own fees and if you win, good; if not, you don't.   But people know -- I mean, the American rule in the legal area is very fundamental, and it strikes me bankruptcy is one of those areas where they go into considerable detail telling you who pays what and when you can get it, just like you say here. You get compensation for preparing the fee at this particular level. And to say that somewhere in -- in all this, you sort of cut and paste these things together and you say, oh, there it shows that they meant fees on fees to be awarded. It seems to me that if they wanted to go against the basic American rule -- it's the American rule, patriotic -- they would have -- they would have spelled that out a little more clearly.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fletcher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. BRIAN H. FLETCHER ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Streett, four minutes.

14-15 +++$+++    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-15, Armstrong v. The Exceptional Child Center. Mr. Withroe. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARL J. WITHROE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   I'm -- I'm sorry, what's correct? That there has been no approval of the particular rates or the methodology?   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler. 4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS   I suppose -- I suppose HHS may be interested in having these provider rates raised so that they get a bigger chunk of the Federal budget. And in fact, I mean the competition here is not between the agencies and the providers. It's between healthcare sector and roads, schools, parks. I mean, the effect here is that Federal judges get to decide what the reimbursement rates are in a particular area, and it depends -- I mean, what would happen if you have five cases going, each one claiming rights to higher rates for under the roads program, under the parks program? Under what? Are you aware of any situation where the Federal judges get together and try to balance the State budget?   Just to follow up, it never approves the rate in particular, right?   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Withroe, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARL J. WITHROE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
14-86 +++$+++    We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-86, the Egual Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores. Mr. Gershengorn. ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   No. You're promoting -- Go ahead.   Well, your -- your solution that you suggested is that if there's some doubt the employer should begin a dialogue, I think is what you -- but I think that may promote stereotypes to a far greater degree than what you're objecting to. Let's say you have someone of Middle Eastern appearance who shows up for the interview with a beard. And the employer, like Abercrombie & Fitch, they don't like beards. They don't want their models, as they call them, having beards. But he doesn't know if the beard is there for a religion reason or not. So you think it's better to him to sit there and start asking this applicant questions he would not ask anyone else about religion? Why are you wearing a beard? Is there some religious reason for that? It seems that your solution causes more problems.   Well, is it reasonable for an employer to say, look, I don't want to buy into some problem with a guy who has a beard. I'm going to say can you shave it? He's going to say no or he's only going to shave twice a week. I mean, isn't he reasonably going to say -- let's say, I don't care if it's religious -- a religious reason or not. The guy shows up with a beard. I'm not going to hire him.   To get --   To get back to my beard case, is there -- if it's someone with a Middle Eastern appearance with a beard, you want the employer to begin some kind of a dialogue. If it's somebody who's not Middle Eastern and has a beard, can the employer assume, well, I don't think that's for religious reasons? In other words, he's going to be asking religious questions of some people based on a stereotype, but not others.   Could you answer my question, please?   The question is supposed -- the question is supposed to be why are you wearing a beard?   So that doesn't cover anything that's not immediately apparent -- apparent by the appearance. You make -- they can have a code of conduct that presumably would go through several pages, Here are all the things we require. Any problem with any of them?   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gershengorn, you have five minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
