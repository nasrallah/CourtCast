To Do List
----------

1b. Front end display:
	x undecided outcomes
	x limit decimal places, as percent
	x invert sentiment and amicus
	x lines between groups
	- headings for y axis, x axis
	- maj/min votes
	- argument date, decision date

2. Feature importance plot
3. Data story plots
	- unanimous decisions over time
	- affirmations over time
4. Revisit classifier choice
6. Topic as feature
7. Sentiment using specialized legal dictionary or other textblob option




x Demo List
	x chat with Kevin/Genevieve
	x submit listx Recent data -> cases just argued but not decided. and important cases. others if time.
	x preprocess files
	x integrate with scdb
	x transcript process decided and undecided cases
	x classify
	x add cases to database
	x onto server
x Front-end. Figure integration.
	x figures just keep adding to the plot.
	x needing to refresh to get plot to appear
	x get figure integration onto AWSx AWS
x sentiment using dictionaries -> scores as features
- sentiment using Bag of words lists as features
x SVM Classifier, lasso penalty or something
x more features: justice_questions
x feature selection
 
- slides
- data stories: aereo stock history, prediction
x cv update (Wed)


With the pdfs converted I can make predictions. But without the outcomes I can’t confirm them.
- compile list of docket, case name, party_winning for recent cases not in scdb
- convert new cases from pdf to text, clean up. 

- scikit validation curve

Examples:
12-307 United State v Windsor (DOMA)
12-398 Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics

Affordable care act:
11-393  National Federation of Independent Business, et al. v. Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services, et al.

x time features
x store for each case the 1/0 prediction and probability from RF and/or SVM
x More features: justice_interruptions
x Random Forest Classifier
x Cross validation
x git commit
x put data in mysql database
x connect python to sql to enter information
x front end up: sql -> python -> flask -> twitter bootstrap
x resume
x use pandas

x Write P(Pet|features to file)
x Write interrupted to file (with docket)
x Get Docket, case_name, Outcome, Votecount from SCDB

x Or just get those from SCDB initially, then add the interruptions. Maybe be a DataFrame?
